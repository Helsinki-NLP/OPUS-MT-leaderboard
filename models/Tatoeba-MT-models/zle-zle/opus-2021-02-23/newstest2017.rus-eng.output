28-year-old cook has been found dead in the São Francisco Trade Center
A 28-year-old cook, who had recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a stairwell in the local shopping centre this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine someone who wants to hurt him by saying, "He's got things done right."
The body found in Westfield Mol on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galisia, reported to the San Francisco Bureau of Forensic Expertise.
The Department of Police of San Francisco reports that death was classified as murder and investigations continue.
The victim's brother, Luis Galisia, told the KGO TV company ABC in San Francisco that Frank, a past cooking line in Boston, got his job as a cook at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters six months ago.
The representative of Sons & Daughters said they were "smacked and crushed" by his death.
"We're a small team that works as a friendly family and it's going to be very scarce," said the representative.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult period.
Luis Galisia said that Frank had first stayed in the hostels, but lately, "He's got a lot of business."
"He found the apartment, he met the girl," - Luis Galisia said to KGO.
Louis Galisia said he couldn't imagine someone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a great heart.
His way of dealing with the family has always been to prepare us for some meal, to prepare us for dinner," said Luis Galisia.
He never wanted to be involved in any controversy.
He was a brother who was sailing through the current.
"In all the bad things that's happening to this world, he was that unrestricted diamond that brightly shined every day," he said.
All who possess the information are asked to call the SFPD Hot Line at 415-575-4444.

He explained that in the closed consultations of Sowbez, he had provided information to Member States on the incidents in the territory of the Republic of Krym and read out a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the RF, which “expressed concern and resentment for attempting terrorists and sabotage in the territory of the Republic of Krym”.

Scientists Found an Animal That Can Live 500 Years
The international group of biologists concluded that the longest-lived spine animal is the Greenland Polar Shark, which can live for about 500 years, transmits RT.
Scientists have conducted radiocarbon analysis of the eyes of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is more than five metres long, can be between 272 and 512 years.
Biologists believe that a low metabolism, which leads to slow development, plays an important role in the longevity of sharks.
The females of the Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity only in 150 years.
Previously, it was believed that the shark, the Greenland whale, lived the longest of all spine animals.
The oldest person known to scientist was a little over 210 years old.

Should we go to the sanatorium if there is no health problem?
Our expert is Olga Godsh's chief doctor.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to the sanatorium?
It's not only for treatment but also for the prevention of disease.
In the event of a sanatorium, a person can check his body and receive the doctor’s advice on how to live so that his health does not deteriorate.
Such recommendations will not be too much.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal to the organism, and shouldn't be missed.
Strong stress, mental and physical exhaustion can lead to depression and chronic fatigue.
And the stress is about 90 percent of the arrivals.
He is most vulnerable to cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it's better not to combine the situation and give yourself some time to rest.
Research shows that 98 per cent of people decline their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to leave with your children, you don't have to break up with them.
For children, even the smallest, health programmes include both diagnostic services, paediatric advice, analysis and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's basins), inhalation, special diet, massage, oxygen cocktails, curative physicals.
The course of the procedures is defined by a doctor taking into account the individual evidence and the characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, a child club with animators, where children can attend games, is usually used in various workshops.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for visitors with infants, provide breastfeeders with the necessary conditions and provide experienced nanny services.
A soft winter, a long summer, an abundance of solar days in the year (over 300) create good conditions for round-year rest on the Caucasian Mineral Water resorts.
And then the body needs to rest not only in summer.
Therefore, there is no need to be afraid of weather outside the window, since most of the procedures are in place and are independent of the season.
Generally, sanator-cort treatment is preferable to be treated twice a year, especially for adults.
The main fabric of the Caucasian Mineral Water region is, of course, therapeutic mineral sources: Slavic, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters are unique and affect different systems of the organism.
Water varies by temperature, number of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor picks up the water depending on the patient's feelings.
For example, Narzan has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating operation, rehabilitating the functions of the cotton stomach and the exchange of substances.
Essentuki 4 is influencing the ventriloquist, reducing the sugar level.
The Essentuki New performs an anti-inflammatory, yellow and urine operation.
The same effect is enjoyed by the water of “Slavian”.
When water is assigned, the doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks down less salt water because salt holds the liquid, which leads to increased pressure.
Mineral water is required to comply with the regime: water must be drank at a certain time, at the appropriate quantity and at a specific temperature.
Different cosmetological procedures for individuals and bodies are now available in sanatoriums.
What kind of healing, based on the natural characteristics of the North Caucasus, can be obtained from the resorts in the region?
A salt lake of Tambukán near Pätihursk, for example, is the salt lake of Tambucan, of which is useful for joints, spines, interior organs.
It is an anti-inflammatory, dispatching, immunomodulating operation.
These are recreational walks on individually constructed routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge Curort Park (second by size in Europe).
It's popular in Kislobodsk, which is close to the mineral source Narzan.
There are also wine baths, pearls, yoo-holy, village, chalpheine-lacritical, depending on what your doctor will appoint.
We'll continue the fertility.
What can you do to make the harvest go by the end of the season?
Tells Julia Belopukow, agronomist and darling.
The time for the high-sea tomatoes to build a pinch: to remove new pastures, to cut the mats, to remove all the leaves before the last hand with fruits and flowers with small ties is unsuccessful.
All tomatoes, irrespective of “constitutions”, as well as peppers and bachelors, feed with zol-and-superphosphate extraction, processed by bi-parata (Dissuer, to accelerate the oil and growth of fetuses, Fitosin-M, Fitolavin, Gamire, Baktophyt, Immunocytophyit, to increase immunity, Bitoxybacillin, Lepidocide, Fitoverm, if any pests).
At the end of the summer, only copper domes, cologne sulphur, and green soap should be used.
We're doing the last plant field.
Long-patched cucumbers in the heat shall be released from the wallpaper so that the lower, naked part of the stem (25-40 cm) will be slept on the ground, watered by the warm water and the solution of the Zircon, and the stems 5-7 cm of the composite.
It is also easy to extend the fertilizer: cut the old leaves, pour the warm water and solve the complex fertilizer, and sleep the fertile soil under the bush.
For protection from the colds of the night, install an arc with cover.
Keep your vegetation open in the day, and shut it down after sunset.
The sign of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia ' s withdrawal from the last twenty years of recession.
According to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, GDP is showing positive developments, and GDP declined by 0.8 per cent in the annual term in the second quarter.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to Rostat’s recent data, the decline in the Russian economy in the second quarter has slowed to 0.6 per cent.
The stabilization of the situation has also recently been stated by Centralobank and Min Economy.
There's a slow growth ahead.
According to CBI experts, the recession in the Russian economy remained in the past.
“The Russian GDP Index estimates that the recession remains behind and that the economy is slow ahead,” says the Russian Bank Banch Banch “What Tradition Says.”
The modular GDP assessment for the current quarter of the regulator has increased to 0.4 per cent, and the fourth quarter estimate is 0.5 per cent.
The Ministry of Economic Development reported that during the second quarter of the GDP downturn, the RF stopped in the second quarter at 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally purified GDP decline was 0.2 per cent in the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the recession stopped: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June, GDP change was between 0 and 0.15," quotes the representative of the MER RIA “Nowness”.
The slowdown in Russian economy over the last five quarters indicates that “the day is over.”
Among other markers indicating signs of revitalization of the national economy, Bloomberg describes the growth of demand for electricity and rail transport and the revitalization of business.
If you make adjustments to the year high, it is clear that the dynamics of plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to an additional working day.
Let's add a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight transport, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data, and plus-minus 0.5 per cent of semi-annual volume can also be explained by seasonality,” explains Cyril Jacobenko of ALOR BROKER.
On the other hand, there are other more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressure.
In July the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
Moreover, the last two weeks Rostat has been fixing deflation.
The prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the course of the rouble, which has shown strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, the results of August have increased by 12 per cent since the beginning of the year.
It is also one of the signs of recovery that must be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy,” stresses Jacobenko.
In addition, industrial production has risen in the RF since April.
In June, the figure rose by 1.7 per cent.
The rate of falling from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May is slower.
Positive trends also show the situation in the labour market, where the unemployment rate has declined to 5.4 per cent.
It was only below in September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the question of the real incomes of the population should be left to the best.
In the annual term, the figure decreases by 4.8 per cent.
This may hinder the recovery of the economy, as household expenditure contributes significantly to GDP.
In the economic structure, their share is usually more than 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the strong policy of the Bank of Russia is also a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator holds a 10.5 per cent rate, which does not have a better impact on the real sector.
The negative factor is also under-investment, which hinders industrial capacity development.
But as a whole, it can be assumed that by the end of the year the RF economy will slow down to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015," says the HK Forex Club Irena Rogova.
The naturalization process of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well-fledged in winter sports at Olympiad in Sochi, is not so active in summer sports.
In the Olympic Rio Games, former foreigners speak for Russia, most of the cases are those of former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process -- quite a large number of Russians come under the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of the change in nationality varies.
Someone's been taken to another country as a child without leaving a choice.
Someone didn't stand for a Russian prefabricated place.
And someone thought that there would be better conditions for sports to be created abroad.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian nationality.
In a German passport, a 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa redhead.
But before, of course, she was Elizabeth.
She was born in Omsk in 1988.
A total of four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow the steps of her older sister, doing a light athletics.
Like a sister, Lisa chose a sixth jump.
Stay in Russia, I'm unlikely to be able to move Elena Isinbaev from the throne.
Unfortunately, in the Olympics in Rio, Lisa will be our only landlord, even the former, in the sixth jump sector.
Its best accomplishments in this form of sport are the 2010 Bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the continental primitive in 2016, which it won again in the absence of Helena Ishinbaeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozkova was born in Novoczenek in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists of the gospel.
Because of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Helena, eight other children were raised in the family.
They all lived in a small town in Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena began to get involved in the fight at school.
In showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where another former Russian, Vladislava Izbojnikov, had continued her training at the United States Training Centre.
In the 2012 Olympics, Elena lost in her first fight in London.
But at the world championship that same year, it's a victory.
Before that, she had, by the way, won the world's first silver in 2010.
Thereafter, there were Bronze 2013 and silver 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavle, where she first met the synchronous swimming.
But it would be wrong to say that it was raised by our trainers in Russia.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Maria continued her studies.
Soon it was part of the United States collection and showed excellent results in Pan American games.
It is understandable that, at a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America, it is a ceiling.
The new name, which sounds weird in Russian, was given by Cristina Shaldibin at the age of 11 when her parents decided to continue to teach the girl the art gymnastics over the ocean.
Until then, the girl had taken a favorite sport in Jaroslavle’s family.
After emigrating in the United States, she quickly entered the younger assembly of the country and later broke into the main national team.
At Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
She didn't have to fight for her first positions on the world scene, but for the United States, she organized a real breakthrough -- she brought out a star-blood assembly at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our ex-worms is Janrezco-Marggrander, who is in favour of Germany's assembly.
She was born in Toljatti.
In 2008, when she was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more prospects for a national assembly.
Soon she was presenting her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It was true that Jan could take only 17 places that were not sufficient to get into the final competitions in personal primacy.
But two years earlier, she was able to win the Olympic Games Bronze Medal - Young.
Another gymnast, only this time the sportsman is Irena Sazoneov.
If the emigration routes of the athletes mentioned earlier are standard, the choice of Irena’s family is very unusual, Iceland.
Ira is a teacher of a Volgograd sports school.
In Iceland, of course, she immediately became a champion of the country.
True, Ira is still trained in Russia, and he comes to his home country specifically so as not to lose his skills.
In Rio, she didn't speak as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in a personal polygon.
Information about Mary Ugolkova's swimming in Russian information space is very little.
Maria lives and trains in Switzerland for a very long time.
For a long time, however, she has been under the Russian flag, showing good results -- even the country's record of 200 metres of batterfly.
In 2015, she acquired Swiss citizenship and began to speak under a red and white flag.
In Rio, her best address is 14 in 4x100 complex estaphite.
To get to play, the girl launched a storing project, which enabled her to collect some 6,000 francs that allowed her to pay for the training for the Olympics.
Adam Batirov, a 31-year-old freestyle fighter, spent almost all his career under Russian flag.
During that time, Hasavurta was a three - time harbor of European championships, a Russian champion of sports master of Russia’s international class.
When he stopped entering our national assembly, it was time to reflect on the change of nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from sports.
The triumphal return took place at the 2016 Asian championship - Batirov had already represented Bahrain, for which the gold medal had won and had been travelled to Olympics in Rio.
Another ex-Russian, Mikhail Dyunov, is even less known in the home than even the Swiss sailor Maria Ugolkovu.
The fact is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when he was a little boy.
That's where Mikhail started his sports gymnastics.
It has not made great progress at the international level.
In Rio, the best result was 40 seats in parallel bruises.
But for New Zealand, even getting into the Olympic Games in a sports hymнаstics is a breakthrough.
When Nasta, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her activities in synchronous navigation, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, a girl took a 6th place at the European Championship in Berlin.
In a duet with Eugenia, Tetelbaum Anastasia took the eighth place.
In a salt program, she was five.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Croyter is in favour of the assembly of Israel.
When he was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry was already a champion of the country.
That same year he won the world's youth championship.
A year later, Croyter wins the gold of the Olympic Young Games in Singapore.
Dmitry, in addition to leaping at high altitudes, has a long and triple jump.
Albert is another 31-year-old Hasaurt, who, after a long presentation for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which would be represented in Rio.
In Russia, however, he spoke for the Higher Sports School of Redoirsk, even becoming a champion of the country in 2011.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the USSR assembled player on the volition of Yaroslav Antonov.
Literally a year before Jaroslav’s son was born, he was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
The same family remained permanent.
In 2015, he became a bronze-produced European championship in his new homeland.
Hajiev was born in Chechnya in 1994, and he joined his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, my parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to reach that northern country — it had to travel to France, Nizza.
There Zelimhan continued to learn free struggle.
Soon he won the first peace among the youths and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France on the fight tournament.
And again a free fight, and again a former Russian.
This time we'll talk about the North Ossetia emigrated to Spain, the Timuras Freyev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and he is now in favour of the team assembled.
In fact, 30-year-old athletes have also seen high results in Russia.
It has become the 2007 and 2008 bronze support for championships.
The statute of non-contributory, Timeuras, decided to change sports citizenship.
The last one on our list is the Chechen boxer born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Mahakale, Arthur Biarslanov.
When he was ten years old, his parents took his family across Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur began a boxing exercise on the advice of his older brother.
Since then, Arthur has become a champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he has become a champion of peace among young people.
In 2015, Biarsenov won the gold of Pan American games, the first of which was his new homeland since 1975.

Why are the kids in school at school?
According to Governor B. Condrèvèvé, "people need to be educated, not by actions and parades, but by systems."
They have to grow up and, since at least seven years of age, they have to understand that they are coss and education must be cosmic.
But as long as I think this work is being done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Kazachi classes take on all the positive things that were accumulated earlier, at a qualitatively new level, I will be pleased.
If we don't know how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
The FMC continues to be one of the most criminal sectors in the country's economy.
There is an infringement of funds allocated to the public sector from budgets at different levels.
According to the report of the Genprocuratora, overstated tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the SPC.
As a result, the consumers of the region have paid more than 170 million roubles of energy.
During the days and attorney ' s office of the Redodar province, the facts of the incorporation of unreasonable costs into the tariffs have been identified.
In addition, 4 million roubles were leased for vehicles at a price higher than the market.
And such examples in the country are mass.
The people pay the last money for the “communal”, which pays correctly, according to the Ministry of Justice, the average collection of payments from the population is 94 per cent.
He is accused immediately of several articles of the Criminal Code: disbursement, legalization of the proceeds of the crime, abuse of authority, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund involved in renovating urban facilities, Makarov entered into contracts with entrepreneurs, the work on them was not actually done but paid.
Businessmen were just returning him most of the money.
As the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but the service providers did not pay and spent it on their needs.
As a result, the budget and the inhabitants are damaged by millions of roubles.
Macarov's scheme, unfortunately, is typical of Russia.
There was a wave of arrests and detentions by the leaders of the UK, who awarded money to citizens.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kohan is continuing, by the way, to the former townman, who is accused of roubling by 91.7 million roubles.
According to the investigation version, in 2012-2013, he established 6 companies in Elizaro Kamchatka and established 3 limited-responsibility societies.
One of them performed contractual work for the UK, two of them played the role of counting and casing centres, that is, taking money from the population.
However, A. Kohan’s energies did not make a list of funds but was spent on themselves as a loved one.
It is quite difficult to deal with the FMC.
They don't get excited, they're prolonged.
And “He helps” in this highly confused housing legislation,” according to Svetlan Ravoverne, executive director of the NP, “LHCH Control”.
We don't have one law to earn, as we're making a new one, which must make the previous one work.
There are also few experts, including judges, on the issue of FMC.
Lawyers themselves recognize that housing law is very low in school.
Refusal to institute criminal proceedings, fibers during investigations are also reported in Hencourtura.
From the 2015 production of 3.5,000 crimes, less than half are sent to the courts.
The remaining investigation has been prolonged, and each fifth has been suspended owing to the failure of the accused.
There are often gaps in law enforcement.
The law is, but the authorities do not rush to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were some 230 reports of counterfeiting, and only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
In 5 months of this year, the number increased only slightly to 99.
What's the falsification of the report of the Household Congregation?
This means that the change in home management, financial and other issues are in circumventing the views of the owners.
This also means that housing and communal services cannot be marketed by normal companies that want to work honestly rather than to reach the population.
So it turns out that the poor, the small and medium-sized business, too.
First of all, by eliminating corruption as such in all States, Anton Jarkov is confident that he is a member of the Property Affairs Committee.
This work is now being actively pursued.
It's not just single actions, it's a targeted anti-corruption course.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, scandals in the capital do not smell.
Why is there no scandal in Moscow in the area of FGM, as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital Government has shown iron will and order, AIF has told Anatolia Electronic, a member of the Committee of the Lord on Security and Opposition to Corruption.
I mean both the personnel issue and legislative amendments and legal education.
Controlling companies have been supervised and they have all been licensed.
The complaints of citizens are resolved expeditiously in public space (and the treatment of the residents and the responses are posted on the Moscow Government portal).
Many not only pay monthly receipts but watch carefully what it says about the house.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and obligations of resource- and managerial organizations is very high.
Plus Moscow verifys the subsidy of tariffs for housing and communal services, as a scarce portion of the budget is for subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
I think that's all together, explaining the calm situation in Moscow.
Is everything in the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe you should change your place of work.
The Turkish gumbit.
Will Erdogan be able to renounce friendships with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey, Rejep Tayip Erdogan, presented the United States with an ultimatum, proposing to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of a coup d'état.
He said that by speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on Americans to renounce their support for the “terrorist organization of fethullahists”.
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the US is calling for a change of position.
Experts believe that the division between Turkey and the West is increasing and can lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
“Rano or late America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO.”
Either a coup d'état of FETO or a democratic Turkey.
She should make this choice,” quotes the Anatolian Agency for Erdogan's treatment, which spoke on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but he demanded more severely from the United States to comply with his demand for the first time after the oppression of the rebellion.
Recall that, on the night of 16 July, the Turkish military high-ranking representatives attempted to overthrow the legitimacy of the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the Head of State.
However, after Rejep Erdogan addressed the population, the rebellion was suppressed and his organizers and participants arrested.
A total of 8,000 people were suspected, with teachers and scientists in the ranks other than the military.
Regep Erdogan believes that Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania in the United States, was their mentor.
Erdogan's supporters also assumed that the Americans could be intertwined in the state.
All claims had been challenged by refusing to issue Gulen and inviting her to change the tone.
The last statement by the representatives of the State party in this regard was made at the time of the visit of Erdogan to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
This does not, however, stop the President of Turkey -- he insists on his own and also imposes demands on his other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under a migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not call the date of the lifting of visas limitations for Turkish citizens”, the Minister of Turkey for EU Affairs Omer Chelik stated on 9 August.
He said that Ankara ' s amendment to the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe ' s own security.
Notice that on 1 August, Zigmar Gabriel, the German vice-chainer, demanded that the European Union stop the blackmail by promises to open borders for migrants to facilitate the visas regime from the EU.
His words had become a response to the relevant statement by the Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Maulut Chawashoglu.
Another provocative statement made to Chawashoglu in the past environment, arguing that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not ruled that the country will consider leaving the alliance unless expected support is met.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence sphere is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that collaborate with foreign States in the defence sphere, importing missiles," said Chawashoglu in an interview with the Anadolu Agency.
He said that Turkey now needed to establish its own defence system on the basis of its technology, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
“To date, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but we have not been satisfied with the results and we have been seeking others,” said the Minister.
Experts believe that all of this reflects Turkey ' s serious differences with the West and its reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Experts, Eugenius Minchenko, believes that Rejep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot confront the West.
He has a lot of business and military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to balance the framework with the West.
Although, of course, the Americans would be more comfortable to see at this post as a fully obedient person," the expert explained to Aif.ru.
He said that it was not excluded that, after the Turkish leader's statements (on non-payment of EU compensation, the requirement of non-visual space with Europe and the issuance of Gulen from the United States) would be pressured on him.
“Rejep Erdogan will face the deterioration of relations with America and with the European Union, and they will jeopardize it on humanitarian issues, dictatorial practices in the country and so on,” says Minchenko.
The head of the Political Information Centre, Alexey Muhien, admits that the President of Turkey will change his view of Russia as soon as he becomes profitable.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took a very strong stand against Russia and sought favor in all ways in the West.
In a very small time, the situation had changed to the opposite.
Guarantee that the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again, no.
I think Erdogan entered the period of human diplomacy.
When he gets between the two poles, the West and Russia, he'll try to gain the maximum benefit for himself," he thinks Muhien.
In his view, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to retain political power in the country, and he is just in need of Russia and its partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop the United States from supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the United States to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, the consensus with Turkey will be reached,” the expert considers.
The head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glasov, is different.
Turkey's relations with the EU and the United States are now quite tense, and this is primarily related to the internal policies of Erdogan personally.
I think that this crisis in relations will be exacerbated, and in the face of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reload policies both in the Middle East and with Russia.
The President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, has no coincidence that they are willing to change their position on a number of Syrian issues, has been resolved by relations with Israel, and is actively engaged in political interaction with Iran”, explained Aif.ru Glasov, which would allow the next step of Erdogan to become a normalization of relations with Egypt.
She said that the policy that Erdogan was now pursuing was a return to the course of the foreign policy concept followed by Turkey before the Arab revolution.
“At that time, in the “no problems with neighbours” positions, Turkey has begun to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region.
The visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and Africa have now been very successful.
The external policy vector will therefore be developed and will enhance Turkey's positions both in the regional and international arenas”, the expert believes.
The eye believes that returning Turkey to the former relations with the EU will be incredibly difficult, rather than whether the EU will respond rigidly to Turkey, which can open borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Suggestion of junior doctors: Call for new collective protests
Representatives of younger doctors requested the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over the new labour contract.
The Committee of Junior Physicians (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is about to request its full council to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC said that the ministers could not answer questions about the labour contract.
The Junior Doctors and Medical Students voted in July for the abolition of the labour contract agreement with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members participating in the secret ballot.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, Chairman JDC Ellen McCort said that the Government continued to “continue to keep silent” over the problems she said that had led to the rejection of the labour contract.
She said, “In considering the current situation, the JDC leader voted in favour of rejecting the proposed new employment contract in full volume and called for formal renegotiations on all your issues”.
In response to the silence of the Government, the JDC leader has now made a formal request for an extraordinary BMA Council meeting to endorse the continuing programme of expansion of collective protests from early September.
The controversy led young doctors to participate in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of BMA Junior Physicians, Dr. Joan Malavan, resigned after a vote for the lifting of the agreed terms of the contract, which BMA recommended.
He told BMA members that the transaction was a good deal to be adopted during the meetings prior to the vote of 54,000 young doctors and medical students.
After a vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the employment contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey, "Alias Bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in a golden palace in St. Petersburg, I had a steady impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was a handshake, yeah.
But Mr. Putin’s smile seemed tense, and he barely emitted heat even on his own restraint standards.
Regep Tayip Erdogan spoke in contrast repeatedly of his “friend” Mr. Putin — five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, one newspaper described Mr. Erdogan's actions as if nothing wrong had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm meant the opposite.
But the protracted coolness from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first cause of the crisis he mentioned in the introductory comments was that Turkey defeated the Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that point was frantic.
Mr. Putin burst into an angry tyranny, accusing Ankara of the Moscow blast in the back.
Insults were even stronger on the basis of a supposed friend.
Recovery of real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
During the months, the media controlled by the State carried out a shocking, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks were supposed to be found guilty of everything.
The most serious accusations from senior officials were that Mr. Erdogan's own family relied on the illegal trade in oil from Syrian zones controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it decisively.
But in St. Petersburg there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting was only because Mr. Putin was apologized to President Erdogan.
Russia could have claimed a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of announcement of truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost overthrown in his post last month in an attempt to coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have clearly shocked him, too.
There is also a economic reason.
Russian sanctions were severely struck — especially by the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number fell sharply by almost 90%.
With regard to Russia, the tourists and charter companies here, of course, will be relieved when the flights finally resume.
They're putting the end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, public television predicted more cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
"Turists over there, tomatoes back here," as the report said in the newsletter.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara's evil on the West because she thinks it's a weak answer to an attempt at a coup.
Add her long-standing dissatisfaction to the turtles at the rate of accession to the EU and the step of Mr. Putin, who seeks to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroy Turkish relations with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won the bonus scores with Ankara for calling for the support of the elected authorities after an attempt at a coup d'état.
Bear in mind, this is a tribute to Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of the change of regime.
So the summit in this brilliant palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as “the aliannes of the bad”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West unite forces.
However, despite the public demonstration of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite parties.
Perhaps it is for itself that after almost three hours of initial talks, while the two Presidents had a press conference, they had not even touched on the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided responding to their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement as to how they can find a common language on Syria.
But after months of open hostility -- and taking into account the possibility of a complete catastrophe when a NATO member of Turkey struck down a Russian jet fighter -- it is better that two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
Brend RBS should be reduced to the role of bec offis, according to the bank's executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross MacEvan told the BBC of Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has abandoned them since he almost collapsed eight years ago and needed to be saved.
During this period, brand strategies used “RBS” to protect other consumer loan brands.
He was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship to international sport, from the six Ragbi Cup to the Wimbledon Andy Murray champion.
But it was now decided that it was right to allow more national brands to go first.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scotland clients but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including an external head office and a stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brend Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will be more influenced by Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan interviewed customers and staff at Invernessshire during the tour.
He said to BBC Scotland, "Brend RBS will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be employed, because we are now becoming more a brand bank."
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I now say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their population groups, and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the six nations Cube, and it will increase the profile of various brands in sponsoring sports.
"It's a good time for us to move a bank of brands, because on the basis (we were asking ourselves) how are we focusing on improving the customer bank?" said the executive director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and close all these brands.
But with the work we did, focusing on customer needs, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can return these brands again, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettors comes to 3,000 winners winning in Newmarket on the Parasty.
Children spray champagne after the duplicate in Newmarket brings him to 3,000 winners.
Joke Frankie Dettory won his 3,000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this remarkable mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track -- on the Passion trained by John Lord.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth beetle that has reached this remarkable mark in smooth leaps.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Iddery and Willy Carson.
The three-fold champion of the baby, who had won the Ghayar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very excited because my family's here too.
I'm very glad it happened in Newmarket, because that's where I lived 30 years ago.
It's not a big secular event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a normal Friday evening of 20,000 people.
I'm free from business and I'm very unattractive.
Children applause when they bring the Prejudice after the victory.
Two jockeys have reached this point in leaps with obstacles: Richard Johnson's champion of beetle and the 20-fold retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4,300 winners for a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-fold Derby winner, 4493 career winners
Franky is one of the best beetles of the modern era, and it is not surprising that it has reached this mark, which so few have reached before it.
He's styley and strong, but it's his tactical laughter that distinguishes him from the others in the weight room.
He's a great leapman, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a bunch of weekends and big jumps!
And if seriously, Frankie brought winners in Britain for more than 30 years, that's great to see.
He's an energetic character that's good for British leaps, but, moreover, he's an incredible bug.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark by a firm-scrupulous bucket with a horse.
Frankie Dettori is a symbol of British smooth leaps for two decades from fast finishes to fast-growing leaps.
They were blows and falls.
Many of the winners of large jumps, including his famous Big Semerk in Ascota in 1996, but he also survived the air accident and was disqualified because of the doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after a six-month disqualification, but he showed a tremendous force of will to challenge skepticism and return to form.
And he may not have finished for a while — the children had previously said that they would like to continue to participate in competitions, at least up to 50 years of age.
Putin dismisses Sergei Ivanova's head of administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly fired his head of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivan was part of the trusted Middle Circle of Putin for many years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed representative for environment and transport.
The statement from the Kremlin states that Putin "decised to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the President," but did not explain the reason.
Mr. Ivanova, Vice-Chairman from 2012, Anton Weino, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Weino, 44, former diplomat.
Tallina, born in the capital of Estonia in 1972, ended the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGMO) and served in the Tokyo Embassy.
He was later head of the management of the President ' s protocol and the Government ' s apparatus, reports the Kreml website (in Russian).
During his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the Administration is to support your activities as Heads of State in the formulation of draft laws and the monitoring of how your directives are being implemented.
Putin informed a Russian telecommunication on Friday that Ivan had asked him to be released from his office and recommended that Weino replace him.
Are smiles sure?
It's a move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest supporters of Vladimir Putin and, like him, served in the Soviet Security Service, the CGB.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on State television, both men stated that the head of the Administration had resigned according to his own desire.
Despite the smiles on the camera, this has little persuasion — especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So these are the unforeseen consequences of some struggle for power?
Until no one knows.
But the official statement -- that the man who was once aggressed as a potential president -- suddenly wanted to rule Russian environmental policy -- was met with a huge skepticism.
In Putin's comments quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you to trust me with this very difficult post, even a problem-related post, for four years.
Well, well, I was head of the President's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivan entered the post in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He was a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the KGB State Security Service, as was Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivan was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people to whom he trusted most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could be president of Russia after the second term of Putin, since the third term for Putin would be contrary to the Constitution.
However, another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, took this post.
Putin became Prime Minister before he returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson is fired after a fight with a producer.
Gibson was a participant in the Los Angeles show footage last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his removal was announced.
There were creative differences in photographs and divergence.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how the character of Gibson will be removed from the show that the FBI agent team is expected to follow, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor who had previously played a major role in Darma and Greg's retreat had been on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love "Mind as a Criminal" and put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," said Gibbson in his statement issued on Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end of it, but now it'll be impossible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our great team, and, most importantly, the best worshipers that the show could only dream of.
It's supposed to come back with its 12th season on September 28th.
Mystery: Fish landed in the garden of Banffa
A man from Banfa asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be sandsticks left behind with a watery fatty.
Bein, who lives in 500 meters from the sea, took a picture of this sight to Perisscope, hoping that someone would be able to shed light on the appearance of two dual fishes.
Quinsferri Krossing: The bridge is now connected to Faif
The $1.35 billion project should now be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern passage and the Queensferry Crossing, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faif.
It's the first of four tubes between the canvas that are now close to the completion of all three pilots of the bridge.
The Faif Bridge Section is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of bridge.
The $1.35 billion project should now be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economics, Kit Brown, visited the site today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in Quinsferry Crosing's construction.
We are all witness to the engineering arts in a really epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete have been used only to build this part of the bridge.
Notwithstanding the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the leakage between the Viaduc and the bridge canvas is a victorious operation using extremely accurate prescriptions for assembly.
A total of about 79% of all bridge canvas are now on the ground, and for the last section of the canvas, the concrete cover is being poured out at Rosate today, which means that all the canvas are ready to take place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said, "The first towing on each bridge project is always a milestone.
In this incredible project, this twist is the most modern construction art.
After setting up the last section of the road canvas and connecting it to the expanding North Pilot road canvas, we were left to close the remaining glances on the north side — or on the coast — of the north.
This has been done by extending the north approach to 700 millimeters south.
It was a huge and very elegant operation at the same time.
The scale is because the diaduca is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be lifted up by a slope of about 3 per cent.
Excellent because the assumptions that the team was working on were tiny — just a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, it went very well.
Rescue in the Gulf of Moelfr: Three men are lucky to survive.
Three men were lucky to survive after they were thrown out of the fishing ship to England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised alarm at 13:20 on British summer time on Friday, after the team saw an accident in the Moelfr Gulf.
Three men tried hard to get to a safe place while their ship continued its journey.
"We saw their ship shining next to them and supposed to be the worst," said the Moelfre Wins Jones steering rescue boat.
"Fortunately, by the time we got down on the water, a strong wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel, and the third man for 60 years was found frustrated and dragged into a buoy without a lifesaving waist.
All of them were taken to the shoreboat and taken to the rescue station.
Jones said, "Three men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely undamaged.
The boat engine had an accidental unlock, but it somehow stuck away from the man who managed the boat when it woke up.
Somebody's been protecting these guys today.
Pokémon Go, deserving of health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that adolescents and children no longer go outside to play, preferring to spend their leisure time watching the screens has been a complaint for many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is taking people away from the couch and engaging in some physical activity.
The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then video games, and lately to smartphones.
It is so good to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the total enthusiasm that Pokémon Go is, based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (a result of a series of cartoons, game cards and other responses).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomena, all of this has been lost sometime before the new game was made available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at that time was detained because of the mass response that had overloaded the servers.
In the few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, smartphone players are going to look for Pokémons who are tracking GPS and, when discovered, can be "photographed" (through a screenshot on your phone) or 'acceptated'.
The generation that played the game, as younger, joined a fantastic addiction, leaving the couchs to search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps being taken by a “usual” person every day.
Cardiogram, an Apple Watch application that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported Washington Post that within two days of the start of the game, the number of people tracked, who were doing 30 minutes of exercise, jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent every day.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary level-by-level data.
Many health-care campaigns that persuade people to find 30 minutes, get up from the couch and be active every day have failed to respond because most health-related messages are boring and voiced by people who seem unhappy.
Nevertheless, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to adjust weight, high arterial pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that she's pulling people out to do what they love.
Thus, three basics of health are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends to hunt.
As usual, there are boring boring mockerys looking for anything to ask for.
And yes, someone can hit the door.
So what?
The breakthrough happened.
Because despite the fact that smartphone applications, such as Fitbit, could already track our physical activity before, they didn't give us a reason for the exercise, as this game gives us.
The news will come, and the use will be weakened over time.
However, because of the success of the Pokemon, more games will come up that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many to be more active, in good form and healthy.

Simon Bayles wins the gold of absolute primaryity in the gymnastics of women.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the mortgage.
Simon Bayes is intimidating for all of this.
Dynamic on the back jump.
Not forced on the log.
Awesome on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympics champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast had risen to the title of the champion on Thursday, putting the gap between himself and the rest of the world on a convincing demonstration under the adjacent Olympic attention.
Her total score was 62.198 at a sufficient distance from the silver medalist and the Final Fifthman team, Eli Rysman, and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Byles, from the United States, speaks at the gymnastic log during the final of the individual absolute majesty of artistic gymnastics for the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byles became the fourth consecutive American woman who won the title of the champion of absolute primaryity and the fifth in general, storing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps at any time.
She was sobbed when she was shown her final score and her long journey to this point ended.
This accomplishment puts it in the same league as rare athletes, such as Michael Felps, who have raised their sports to new altitudes:
Byles has spent the last three years dominating sports, winning the 15 medals of the world's championship -- including 10 golden -- with such awesome programmes in their mixture of labor and accuracy that Mary Lu Retton called the 1984 Olympics championship “the greatest gymnast I ever saw”.
One last test was in Brazil, and the competition was not as high as between the Bayz and the rest in this area as between it and the load of high expectations.
Anything less than going back to his family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be considered an unwarranted expectation.
Simon Bayles from the United States, on the left, and Eli Rajsman are hugging after the gains of gold and silver, respectively, in the finals of the female individual absolute primacy of artistic gymnastics in the Summer Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Byles earned the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final accord for the farewell party of the retiring coordinator of the National Retired Marta Carolie.
While Byles insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, that's not exactly the case.
Part of her free exercise program, which includes her firm passage, is installed on Latin American music, which would come right outside of the Olympic Arena Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was adopted by her grandfather and grandparents as a child starts walking and the mother of an Amy Burman coach during her visit to the hall where Burman was a coach became a force.
It has not lost any competition for absolute primacy since the summer of 2013 — a line of luck that must continue for as long as Bayles wants it.
Despite the small advantage of two moves, Mustafina was a mirage.
The gymnastical logs and free exercises — where Byles protects the rank of the champion of the world — lie in the ambush.
It went forward again from 15.4333 on the log and ended with 15.93 on the floor.
Rysman gently embraced her while they waited for the final account -- the pure formality -- and tears appeared around the brilliant red with the white and blue subводs for the eyes of Bales, when the design that she once wrote in the album for cuts came true.
Rysman's speech was a small revenge for four years ago when she divided the third place, but lost the Bronze Mustafina on the taboo.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team that the Americans call "Grandma" was far ahead.
She sent a crowd of kisses after her free exercise covered by the return, which sometimes seemed questionable.
With regard to Byles, a viral tweet of 19 years from the beginning of this week is now quite new:
Police: 3 victims in the serial killer case shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the most lethal attack on the first Finicks serial killer in the last decade were sitting in the car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Lainer, Stephanie R. Ellis, and Ellis daughter, Malia, were shot down on 12 June when their car was parked on the carriageway.
The criminal fired about eight guns standing on the passenger side of the car and then hiding on another vehicle, reports the report.
The police claim that the triple murder does not appear to be the result of robbery, since the wrongdoer did not take the basket or $2,900 at the disposal of an adult victim.
The representative of the Finniks Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, stated that the shooting had prompted investigators to check whether he was connected to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others wounded as a result of nine attacks in two principally Latin American areas within four months.
"It's in the living area in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, the CBS branch office, early this month.
The suspect is expected to have used several vehicles, including brown Nissan in the late 1990s, black BMW in the late 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were related and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33 years old, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Lainer, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died on the ground.
The Witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also issued a police report on the shelling of an empty peak in half an hour before the three murders and believed to have been a serial killer's hand.
The investigators found guilses and removed a bullet from the seat and fragments of the bullet from the motor compartment.
The mother of a six-year-old child with a microcephalia: "Stand Better."
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pyxivto loves singing, toys, and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund’s microcephalia was the result of a genetic violation that his mother Elizabeth Pixio did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign this.
That's not really true, of course you're signing it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized facility.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing that," explained Pixio.
Edmund's going through the hops.
Edmund didn't sit and crawl until he turned three, and he still doesn't say.
But it's slowly going through some stages.
He walks outside and rides on a bicycle.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture that Edmund invented for "please, sing me."
"We're teaching him the sign language," said Pixyvto CBS News.
But not just the regular sign language — she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephalia may arise as a result of a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund, infections during pregnancy from such viruses as measles and Zica.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary considerably.
It's too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with Zik's virus.
Pyxivto recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
I've been telling you all the time what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I really didn't ask for a lifetime forecast, because I don't expect someone to really tell me.
But Pyxivto has a encouraging council for mothers of children with birth defects because of Zic.
It's getting better.
You know everything's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding is the cause of rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more precipitation expected to fall over the state until Saturday inclusive.
Numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the south of Mississippi have left the shores and threatened large-scale floods after extreme rainfall, reported the National Meteorological Service.
Governor Louisiana John Bell Edwards stated that public officials were in constant contact with the local authorities and the assistance had already gone to the victims ' arrivals.
Mike Steel, representative of the Office of the Governor for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, stated that requests for high-water, boats and sand bags were under way.
Steel said it was only Tanjipahoa's arrival that he asked tens of thousands of sand bags.
The flood risk remains valid until Saturday in most parts of southern Louisiana.
The meteo service said in a statement that an additional 3-5 inches could slip into the area.
In southern Alabama, flooding was on track until Friday, as the rain continued to rain in the Mobil area.
The river Comit next to Baton Rouge and the Amit River next to Dene Springs, both in Louisiana, is expected to set a record of the flooding level for the past weekends.
Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Ruja.
He also said that flooding downstream at Assenchen's coming was a threat, as these abnormal rivers would slowly flow into Lake Morpah.
The Ticco River, just south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest of any registered levels at 9:00 p.m. in Friday.
The rescuers were still taking people out of the floods in the Amit and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of the state of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and pastures were among the rescued early on Friday near Glossphere.
Hansford, 62, says that the waters of Biver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet away from his house, have risen rapidly in the night.
He said that another pasture who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up and the water continued to come," said Hansford.
It reached my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the greatest influenza she had seen in 48 years that she lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family had disabilities, and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that the rescue officers rescued all three of them by means of an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloster, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann says that flooding is “fastly spread” as the rain continues, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Kroutmann says that one observer near Livingstone reported a drop of 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Kroutmann said that the soil was resumpted by rainfall from the environment.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets led to work to save people from houses at Tanjipahoa’s arrival and to cancel schooling in five school districts, and the authorities state.
WWL, CBS branch, reports that counselor Tanjipahoa told about 200 flooded homes.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooding.
The Chairman of Robbie Miller's visit stated that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven high-water domestic animals.
The shelters were opened in the city of Amit and the city of Hammond to accept those evacuated.
"They will have an opportunity to return home as soon as the water begins to retreat," he said.
In the city of Hammond of Tanjipahoa, about two dozen streets were closed because of the high level of water, and sand bags were made available to the people in the hope that they would hold water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said the city manager Lacey Lundrum.
This is on the way to become a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey, reported that the scourge rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that several houses had been recorded as flooded on Thursday, but no one had been registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, director of the Shopper Value Foods store in Amit, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen her before," said Tausson, "and she's still pouring on the ground."
Majaz Brown, 6 “solved with bullets”, survived after the firing in Philadelphia.
The police reported that in Philadelphia, a six-year-old boy was shot, registering the second shooting in the city for six years this week.
Grandparents identified him for the CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown received numerous firearm wounds, including his smell, leg, hand and stomach, but was in the mind when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He's got a lot of it, his little body was removed by bullets," says his grandmother Deroess Melandez station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that he was expected to get better.
He was supposed to go to first grade in local primary school.
Brown was one of the four people who were shot in the Jermanathun block.
Three men were also shot, two 29 years old and one 32 years old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reportedly in critical condition; two other victims were registered in a stable condition, according to the CBS of Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at a front seat next to a 29-year-old in critical condition, and the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether any wounded men could be shot.
The investigators report to the CBS of Philadelphia that there appeared to have been a shooting between several armed people.
The Gilses of semi-automatic weapons attributed to various copies of semi-automatic weapons have seized the place of action.
It seems that it was definitely a long battle.
There were guilts on the street, on both sides of the pavement.
Therefore, it appears that there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting,” reported the Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi.
Many homes and cars in the area were also stolen.
No arrests were made, and the police are reported to be watching cameras.
Another six-year-old child, a girl, was struck in the arm of the helmets Tuesday when she played in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simon, Gabbie and Laurie
That's what I call a women's Olympic gymnastics collection this year and for a few reasons.
First, I've been to every summer of Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And the second is that three gymnasts play a key role: Simon Bayles, Gabbie Douglas, and Lauren Hernandez, who have already inspired so many nonsense girls.
The composition of this collection, supplemented by Ali Riceman, Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This collection looks like America at last.
This has also strengthened the black and Latin American women's presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the female gymnast number one has been African American.
Last year Simon and Gabbie were number one and number two.
It's powerful.
At the last Gabby Douglas Olympic Olympics, the Olympic champion was unexpected, and America welcomed.
The world could now have witnessed the incredible statements of the three-fold World Championship of Simon Bayles, Douglas and Laurie Hernández, performing unexpected, yet virtual, gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American consecutively winning gold in the female absolute primacy.
And Ali Riceman's collecting colleague earned silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this kind of sport, but it doesn't look like this in the gymnastic sections all over the country.
Simon, Gabbie, and Laurie all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form an Olympic assembly.
They're the final five, because the next Olympic gymnastics collection will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year of Marta Carolie's training.
But, in fact, gymnastics are expensive sports, and gymnasts are first trained in private gymnastic clubs supported by parents who pay for the cost of learning, equipment, travel, form, contributions for competition, hotels (for trainers and their gymnasts and families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in rich suburban areas, which can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their training, and this is a expensive and long-term responsibility for gymnast families.
Amy Burman, the coach of Simona Bayles, and Maggie Hany, the coach of Laurie Hernández, both trained their athletes since they accepted the gymnastics.
We must create more affordable and affordable hymnastics for communities of the invisible number of young girls inspired by Simon, Gabbie and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastic fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths (mainly black and Latin Americans) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand in Detroit (my home town) to provide a high-quality hymnastics for young people who deserve to be able to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the sustainability of exhaustive work, discipline and mental resilience.
This combination has had a lifelong positive impact on good health, school success and work.
It's the inspiration of this assembly that will send thousands of girls into gymnastics, and that's great.
Sports are so important, especially for girls.
It's such a great time.
Thank you, Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabbie, and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Power in the winner of Olympic Gold and for motivating so many girls of different origins to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors took up an announcement of further strikes following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers hoped to conclude a dispute about changes by agreeing to the amended contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who had voted rejected it.
In July, Hunte announced plans to enter into the contract, saying that NHS was on "no land" and any further delay would cause damage to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes night-time changes in employment and weekends to improve services during extra-accommodation.
Dr. Ellen McCott, chairman of the BMA Committee of Young Physicians, said last night in a statement: “Any younger doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it will bolster the existing labour crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly.”
It was only eight weeks before the first team of doctors was transferred to a new contract, progress was needed and time was needed.
Attempts by the IMA to resolve the dispute by negotiation have been met by the reluctance to act and, sometimes, by the total silence of the Government.
And it's notwithstanding Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
Jersey Hunt needs to act now, to encourage the introduction and respond to the fears of younger doctors.
If he doesn't do that, then the junior doctors are sure they're willing to organize the next strike.
At the end of April, the latter postponed some 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses while nurses and consultants were recruited to ensure the replacement of doctors on the pixel line.
The Ministers hoped to conclude a dispute over changes by agreeing on a amended contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
DIA wants a better payment for 54,000 younger doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS Employers, called on younger doctors not to continue strikes.
Mortimer stated: “Strikes reach little or nothing, but pressure already running teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorders to patients, nurses and their families.”
During the past two months, we have talked to the Committee of Junior Physicians and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded in a positive manner to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
Workers hoped that continued positive assistance on other important topics, such as the distribution of staff, the flexibility of training, additional training for those returning after a career break, the cost of learning, the mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and the gender difference in pay in medicine, were a sign of the seriousness of employers, health education in England and the Department of Health in meeting the conditions achieved by WMA in November, February and May.
2 pos a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to use a medication for two pounds a day after the authorities have recommended that it be given more people and longer.
The anti-refoulement tikagraire reduces the risk of recycling for people with cardiovascular diseases.
The stop is 12 months after the heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or a new attack.
The NICE Supervisory Service of the British National Health Service has recommended that it be given to people for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE Supervisory Service of the British National Health Service has now requested that it be given to people for four years in order to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs with about 140,000 people in England each year, with a quarter of them having another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of accumulation of fat material on arteries walls and formation of plaques.
If the blade breaks apart, it can cause a trunk that blocks blood to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the tromble moves, he can move through the bloodstream and block the bleed to the brain by causing the stroke.
People who have had one attack are more at risk of getting another.
The Tikagrellor produced by the British AstraZeneca firm, sold under Brilique, reduces the risk by making the trombe less likely.
The draft NICE instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of tikagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Notwithstanding the existence of effective secondary prevention techniques with about a quarter of those who have already had a heart attack, there is another heart attack or stroke — often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition may have a significant negative impact on the quality of life.
There is evidence that cycagralor, combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
Preliminaryly recommending a tikagrallor, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of the tycagralor — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited over three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment longer than that.
The culture of ownership of the PC allows for falsification of vote counts in Muslim areas
Ex-Mair Tower-Hamlets Lutfour Rahman was dismissed last year because of corruption and served as an instinct of the Government's report
The culture of political correctiveness has led to the closing of the eyes, which has resulted in a widespread falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim communities, according to information from the disastrous report of the Government that has been promulgated today.
Sir Eric Pickles, former Cabinet member, is criticized by the police, the electoral observers and the city administration for ignoring the evidence of violations in the elections due to “extreme sensitivity to race and religion”.
The former secretary of the local communities, now an anti-corruption king, reported that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so strong that the police should allow borders outside the polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
To date, voters should simply specify their name and address.
The report even suggests putting inks on the fingers of people when they give up their ballot papers, so that someone can vote twice.
Sir Eric stated that better protection should be provided to informers.
He called for greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups to the press.
“It is done not only to protect itself from fraud in the elections, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud, which goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of a scandal in the Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special court dealing with electoral matters ruled that the Acting Mayor of Luftur Rahman had to be removed from the post in connection with the long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman had “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and had silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, was said, "has led his campaign, based on the duty of the believers of Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes doubted or were the result of personance when a person voted to represent others.
Sir Erik said there were evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed special concerns about fraud with a mail in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they selected.
Sir Erik, in his photograph, made several recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the requirement to bring his identity certificate to prove who you are.
The report states: “There were evidences of pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote by the will of older persons, especially in Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities.
“There were fears that... public institutions had closed their eyes to such conduct because of the excessive sensitivity of “political correctiveness” regarding ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the removal of political activists from working with postal ballots to stop the “growth collection”.
The report, before Teresa May, also calls for extensive registration checks to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration fraud and privileges.
An option is being considered to require voters to issue a identity certificate before the vote.
Use the infinite ink on the fingers of people as soon as they drop their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Perform systematic verification of the nationality of people to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year restriction on applications for automatic postal balloting.
To remove political participants in campaigns and activists from working with completed strikes and envelopes with postal ballots.
To empower the police to establish borders around the electoral stations.
Amend the law to facilitate the prosecution of intimidation in accordance with the submission of the 1983 People ' s Act.
Illegal photography at polling stations.
Demand that only English be used at the polling stations (except Wales).
Intensify training to ensure that the voters are forced to go into the box by one.
Sir Erik violently attacks the city police, claiming it's "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
“A court dealing with elections disqualified Lutfura Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal acts,” he reported.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of proof — on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes unsuccessful “very checks” of the electoral registration divisions of urban administrations.
Sir Erik stated: “The last year's ruling of the trial in Tower Hamlets was a signal of a wake-up.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of the parliamentary elections, yet the alarming and concealed spread of electoral fraud and the denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Cate and other celebrities of Olympics in Rio are crazy.
The Olympics 2016 in Rio this week went crazy on the French cyclist Polynes Ferran-Prevo, which appeared to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old participant of the Olympic Games is not the only athlete who struggles for gold this summer, which can be praised by her own famous double, at least reported in social networks.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous people who appear on our screens at this time, F DAG has compiled a list of Olympics with more than a superficial similarity to the Hollywood stars.
A hunter and a wolf: a member of the U.S. ray team, Brady Allison, on the left, was compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to Kate's double on a bicycle track, many people online have hurried to point out how a certain archaeologist could be a twin of the superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the U.S. radical team, Brady Ellison, became the cause of a hurricane in Twitter, after the images appeared to look frighteningly like the Wolf's star with Wallstrit.
And in fact, the archeologist found out about the societian madness and admitted that he heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
"I personally don't see a huge similarity, maybe except vegetation on my face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt indicate even more this year: a striking similarity between the British jumper Greg Roserford and the popular actor, Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnastka Aliya Mustafine, with her great eyes, is said to be an accurate copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estephan.
And in the South African swimming pool of Cameron Van der Burg, it has been compared to the star Khor Matthew Morrison for many years.
Turning to more unexpected: This user thinks Nathan is a "spoiling version" of an actor "Nachala"
Another long-standing comparison was between the tennisist Rafael Nadar and Josh Harnett, actor, who could be praised by similar heavy brows and lips.
A silver medalist from Russia, Julia Ethimov, may not only have the same glowing skin and bright hair as Anna Linn McCord, while Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, according to fans, is like Joseph Gorgon Levitt.
Surgeon women: Hope Solo Star, on the left, and Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, have the same faces and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities.
By creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of the couple.
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to reveal her delight that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
Indeed, the U.S. football star and the actress of Dexter have incredibly similar shapes of face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile close to the identical smile of the actress Laura Linnie, as well as the winner of the gymnast gymnast gibby Douglas, which may be admired by its own beautiful broad smile, similar to Gabriel Union's smile.
The CBC commentator apologizes for saying that the Chinese fisherman was dead as a pig.
Analysing Bayron McDonald's fourth Finish 14-year-old Ai Yaghang at a women's estaphite with a free 4x200 m style indignated CBC audiences in a direct broadcast of Olympics
The Canadian broadcasting company CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "started like drowsy" and "dead like pigs" during swimming.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was disconnected when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final female estaphet 4x200 m free style.
You could hear McDonald, who was brought to the CBC commentator's team to "small her in the color," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese woman has dropped her ball, baby."
Too excited, as a drowser, she died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese sailor Ai Yanghan, aged 14, sailed the second phase of the estaphate at 1:57.79, for 1.61 seconds more slowly than Canadian Taylor Rak, allowing Canadians to remove the retreat from China.
Audiences across Canada reacted quickly on the network after they were shocked by the tone and the expressions used
Emmett McFarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC talk really just that the 14-year-old swimmer from China died like a pig?"
This idiot didn't realize they were still in the air."
About Ay Yanghan, from China, in the finale of a woman's estaphite of 4x200 m free style, they said, "This is a little 14-year-old Chinese woman who dropped her ball, baby."
Critics in Twitter immediately attacked Byron McDonald, and many urged him to be fired
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how unheard Bayron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sara Paradiz, wrote, "To himself #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us like a bunch of racist people. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was transmitting the CBC, apologized for his comment by McDonald, saying, "We're sorry that the commentary on the presentation on swimming has come to the air."
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry that it happened."
The SAF concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to that statement
A friend of commentator Scott Russell had to apologize to McDonald
CBC then copied and apologized to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments
Telesity too hastened to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to enter the air.
Yesterday night we acted expeditiously to apologize to our audiences in direct air and our subscribers in social networks.
Let us be clear, the commentary of Byron was to be seen as a floater rather than as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron really regrets what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized for a direct air and tried to clarify his commentary, stating that he did not think his words were interpreted as an attack on the person.
'I'd like to take the moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the woman's estaphet,' he said at the CBC Olympic Games.
'I've talked about a floater, not her personal.'
'Of course, it didn't mean any disrespect, and I'm sorry.'
Principal buyer insulted a woman who stubbornly exemplified her underwear in the middle of the store
The buyers didn't know where to take a look, when some woman came naked to put the pants on the floor with the shops in the middle of Principal.
Worse still, she took the look she looked in them, pulled them down, and put them back on the shelf.
She continued the search and eventually died four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shop in Falkstone.
Magazine Principal of the Bouverie Place Trade Centre in Falkstone, where a woman used three-round pants before putting them back on the shelf.
The mother of Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said, after the example of the underwear, the mysterious woman was wearing herself again and leaving the store without buying anything.
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
standing in the middle of the hall, she took a couple of panties from the windmill, took off her own collisions and cowards, and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a place to do it, she was just standing there, rubbish."
"They all got tired when she took off the panties again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with three other couples before she finally decided that there's nothing she likes, she's dressed again, and she's out.
"It doesn't seem like she was concerned about who was watching her, or what she thought about the person who would eventually buy the cowards she used."
Jenny Davidson, a 33-year-old, from Kent, said, "It's disgusting to think someone's going to take home the cowards that someone else has already worn, and they weren't fastening."
It happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I'm making the conclusion that the staff seemed to try to remove these items from the sale after she left, and that's the best."
"I don't want to come home with a couple of women's cowards and find out what another woman wore and filmed them, and they weren't fastened."
The Principal representative said, "Primark knows of the incident that happened at our Falkstone store on Tuesday, 9 August."
All the goods referred to were removed from the sale.
How to protect yourself from assaults with a gun using a crab-maag
The world around you is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help you make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Mizarchi, the Master of the Crabma Federation in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
Whether it comes to you in front or back, this video will show you how to beat the robber of his own weapons.
If it comes back, according to Mizrachi, the first thing to do is to turn around so you can see the attacker and 'free the line'.
Then you squeeze the gun between your forearm and your shoulder, before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
Then there's a knee in the smell, and as the attacker blends away from the pain, you twist the gun out of his hand, beat it in his face with a trunk, and go back and hold the weapon on him.
For an armed, approaching front, the way to do things is to remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and rotate it so that the thief cannot shoot.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and hit the fist in the chest, then turn the gun out of its wreck before you step back and target it.
Does it sound tough?
Look at the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery -- if you're not a crab-bag master -- is to give your cash.
The traveller, Jan Wright, speaks his language in the most dirty places of Europe.
The British traveller has tested his immune system and vomited a serious test, licking some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The leader and author of the travel books, Jan Wright, 51, from Suffolk, spent the language on the euro note, the Perils of Cirk Pickadily, the wreck of the train and the Russian public phone to prove the power of his immune system.
Before he licked each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what it's going into.
But the experiment that should be a film called "The Leadership of the Traveller-Lizun on the Inner Power" has yielded some amazing results.
The thought of licking a button on the train that thousands of others use may be extremely disgusting, but there are actually more bad bacteria in the kitchen shell.
Throughout the journey to Europe, Wright has talked to doctors and medical workers about increasing the intestine bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, none of his meddling has brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known because of the tests on the strength of his intestine, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public pearls in the stations to the debris button, the task was undoubtedly undergoing the immune system.
In a film that he filmed, he said, 'I've been completely careless about my health since I was a child, and I've pulled a lot of things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
Its test stroke demonstrated the value of a luminometer exceeding 4,000 units.
For comparison, the hands that have just been washed should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after his luminometer value was over 4,000 units, while the hands that he had just washed showed less than 60.
Wright and Finnish Maternal Product Manufacturer Valio filmed the travel guide on the Inner Power, which demonstrates the number of bacteria in different locations, for example in the toilet
In the film, he said, "It's close to one of the worst things I smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything, because it's disgusting.
The Directorate of the Internal Force of the Traveller Lizun was removed with the Finnish Maternal Product Manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Rita Valio Gefilus, which contains acidic bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestine bacteria and develop an immune system.
The senior Vice President Valio on bitches, juices and new categories of Niko Vuorenmaa said, "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea of "Call Jan."
They claim that interest in the health of the intestine becomes a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the intestinal health and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary film we were able to provide more information to consumers in an interesting form.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakalah, who was a film director, added, "Let's say, I'd lose respect for Jan if he were to lick some of the things I asked for, like, the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."
Naturally, some of Jan's things were easier to lick, and some were rather tough.
I'm glad that some of these leases we've been able to film.'
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 per cent of respondents linked solely to the good condition of the stomach and intestine, while 58 per cent said that they used at least sometimes products containing added acidic bacteria.
Saltash, Cornwall Municipal House, before the eviction
The Huligan family left her municipal home with damages of 50,000 pounds after they were evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tania Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilkoka, were expelled from their real estate facility in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcedly evicted from the real estate, shocked housing cooperative officials found this real estate in a state requiring repair.
The walls were left with glowing holes, the halves were veiled, the garbage was scattered on the floor, and the walls were splashed by graffiti.
The family is now relocated and is expected to live in a private apartment
Donna McAway, the settler at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that he would not be saved.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like that.
There are many things that need to be weighed because this real property is probably going to be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys bad glory, and their name is a bad fame.
A couple of three children living in a real estate facility from time to time, and the police reported that the kingdom of horror caused by the family included fighting on the streets with baseball battles, intimidation of the inhabitants of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, disputes and slander.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was leased, received a warrant for anti-social behaviour in June.
A few rooms in a house that could be demolished found old debris.
Sex boards in a house where drugs were used to sell in the past
The neighbors say they saw the fights on the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from the house this week, after they had been given an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The eviction was welcomed with relief by neighbors who said that their lives had been transformed into a whole hell.
One said, "They weren't worried."
We lived with them for 20 years, and that was always bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is incredible.
'This morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because we were so quiet here, we didn't get used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Neighborhood Unit, said that the family could not cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the home for 20 years, with the police, and was regularly summoned by the police
Musbore and old toys were scattered below the deceased side of the municipal home
He added, 'It's a shame that the lessee was unable to accept any responsibility for her and her family's conduct, because eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing is considering.
It was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been horrible to her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done bravely to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to neighbours and signal that social behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but he said that they were all a little over 20.

The resettlement workers will now have to remove the garbage chests that surround the house
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 g of cannabis, as well as weights, related supplies and $1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after he found himself guilty of taking possession of class B drugs for supply.
She stated that the money was paid for a gravestone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being made homeless, there is information that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were raffiti across the surface.
The police say they will try to evict tenants who do not comply with the rental rules of the premises.
Angela Crowe, a police officer from Devon and Cornwall, stated that the eviction had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel that they can act without the charges of the prosecutor and those who are hurt by such conduct,' she said.
Crime and anti-social behaviour will never be allowed by the police of Devon and Cornwall, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Portugal's tourists were horrified when the low-flyed military aircraft almost touched the beach
In the town of Awayra, Portugal, tourists frightened for their lives
The P-3C Orion Air Force of Portugal flyed incredibly low
The Air Force reported that it had carried out a training flight but insisted that there was no security risk
This is a moment when frightened tourists start panicking, while the low - flying plane was sleeping over the overcrowded beach.
A military aircraft is seen in dramatic frames, flying almost at a distance from the hunters on a strip of sand in Awayro, northern Portugal.
As soon as they became clear, the resters were concerned about the noise of the aircraft but were unable to see what was moving towards them through the clouds.
The incident took place last night near the town of Awayra in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of several resters who published a video of shocking social networking passes, said, "He's flying very low twice, and there's a moment, at some point, it seems like he's going to break."
Nuno Arroya added, "I've been practicing Serfing and I swear, it was the feeling that the plane was about to fall on me."
The tourists on Awayru Beach were terribly frightened when the plane appeared from a fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force stated today that the P-3C Orion aircraft had been flying to detect fishing vessels offshore and had to descend as low as it was the only way to verify them.
The pilot stated that the aircraft had flown a little lower than it was usually due to the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby combustion forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland part of Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
Portugal ' s air force has made a statement today that the pilot has had to fly so low because of the circumstances of the dense fog and the power of forest fires that have worsened the visibility of the air
The aircraft carried out a training flight and the pilot was assigned to detect fishing boats in the task
The HASSP system has been obligatory for the common drink for more than a year, but most of the cafés and restaurants in Petersburg have not yet been implemented.
Tests are becoming more active, and the business is facing fines up to 1 million roubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points System (HACCP, Russian version of HASSP) - risk analysis and critical checkpoints - is obligatory to use by producers and carriers of food, as well as by companies in general in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
Rosnevor's business tests to meet these standards in Petersburg began in February 2015.
But in the meantime, the officials pay fines only for individual breaches of the regulations (see the list of documents)....
The total failure to comply with the regulations would cost a company of 600,000 roubles for the first breach and 1 million roubles for the second.
CASSP, a system that takes into account the risks and prevention of food, was developed in the United States in the 1960s.
It was then about food security for astronauts.
The system is now being used in all food enterprises not only in the United States but also in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating in TC territory.
The development and implementation of the business system was four years old (the demand for CASSP was initiated in the TC Technologies in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials admit that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Regrettably, we had long been convinced that the norm was only for food production, not for the Restorators, -- explained the chapter of the Public Council of Helena Ceretelie.
Now everyone's trying to get the lost.
The expected resumption of charter flights to Turkey by the end of August to the beginning of September.
But they're not going to call for a futile demand, because their target audience -- families with children -- is already preparing for school, they're making experts.
The Tourism Agency Alliance sent a letter yesterday to the Government requesting approval of charters now.
“In the case of many Russian tourists, the selection of quality and affordable marine recreation is inconsistent, since most of the facilities have been reserved for the end of September in the Krasnodar province and the Republic of Krym,” notes the authors of the letter and stresses that the opening of charter operations in August will not significantly affect the demand for a Russian marine tourism.
As reported in the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union tourindustry (RST), if the aviation departments of Russia and Turkey agree quickly, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding when charts are renewed until they are not available depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, aircraft can fly in September, even August, if the tour operators quickly build the programmes and agree to the airlines required in the direction of the ships”, said Paul Romanians, the Deputy Director of Communications and the international projects of the North-West Regional Office of the RST.
He said that the possible resumption of charters was good news, but it would not have an impact on market power, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - had already returned from recreation and were preparing for school or taking leave in other countries.
During the arctic season, tourists are mainly single travellers and couples.
Those who have the opportunity to rest in a spontaneous manner may count on the charter.” said Paul of the Romanians.
"In Turkey, there's a chance to attract a lot of tourists, if it's going to give very budget proposals -- between 50 and 60,000 roubles for two tour because there are people who are targeted for very cheap tour," says Valerie Rosenthal, Director-General of the Optio-Travel Tour.
In other cases, it is definitely not worth counting on the voyage - the main mass of travel is already planned.
Paul of Romania also believes that since there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, the charters will also be demanded, but it is not worth waiting.
"To Turkey the launch of the charters now is the rehearsal of the next season," says Paul of Romanians.
“The opening of charters to Turkey is a positive news for the next season”, agrees Valerie Rubtsov.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption of the RDPs from the legally established compensation payments within the approved standards for reparation for injury or other health damage.
For employees employed in harmful working conditions, the milk is provided for under the established standards of article 222 of the TC.
In the meantime, the rules and conditions of extradition are established by the Ministry of Education order of 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, free supply of milk or other equivalent food is done to employees during actual employment days with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful production factors in the workplace.
On the basis of these rules, the Russian FNL in the present letter concluded that, according to Abs. 2, para. 3 of NCB 217, the NCFs are exempted from the taxation of income in terms of the value of milk granted to employees in the days of actual employment with harmful working conditions in accordance with the Norms and Conditions approved by the Ministry of Education Order No. 45n of 16.02.2009.
The Moscow Gasstrodbank remains unlicensed for the CB.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked a banking licence from the Acting Commercial Bank of GASSTRABANK, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, AO AKB “GASSTROYBANK” had a high-quality credit policy related to the placement of money in low-quality assets.
Adequate risk assessment on the demand of the oversight body and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank ' s assets have led to the credit organization ' s basis for the implementation of measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in doubtful transit operations.
The bank has appointed temporary administration to serve until the appointment of a competitive manager or liquidator.
The executive powers of the credit organization are suspended in accordance with federal laws.
AKB GASSTRABANK is a member of the Insurance Insurance System.
Recall that the payment of insurance compensation to bank investors, including individual entrepreneurs, under Federal Act No. 177-FZ “On Insurance of Physical Contributions in the Banks of the Russian Federation” is provided for a total of 100 per cent of the fund balance, but not more than 1.4 million roubles, combined with one investor.
The Insurance Agency reports that payments will begin no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the reporting data, 335 in the banking system of the RF were held by the AO AKB assets of GASSTROYBANK as of 1 August 2016.
A London school girl who joined IGIL died in Syria
Kadisa Sultan, one of the three British schoolchildren who had left London last year to join IGIL, reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnim Akunji stated that her family had learned of her death in Racca, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is expected that it was killed by a Russian air strike in Racca, the grouping wall in the country, as reported by ITV News on Thursday.
The Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
“It can only be hoped that the only advantage of all of this is to be a superstition and a will to others that these are the risks involved in traveling to the zone of hostilities to convince people to make the same choice,” said Akunji.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other schoolchildren from eastern London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan’s family said that she married IGIL’s fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reed states that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Judge in the event of election
The leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reed, said that he was convinced that a democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton would be nominated by Judge Merrick Galland to the Supreme Court if he was elected as President.
The Republic of the Senate blocked Galland's claim, and as President Barak Obama nominated it in March.
The leader of the majority group in the Senate Mitch McConnell states that the next President will choose the person who will be able to replace the last judge of the Supreme Court, Antonine Scalia.
Rid stated at the conference call on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland “with some degree of confidence”.
The representative of Reed later said that he did not speak directly to Clinton about whether she would move the Garland and simply constructed the assumptions.
He praised Galands and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to roll a boat with a new choice.
Galland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal for the Colombian District.
Reed stated that the republicans that blocked the nomination of the Garland are the "prizes" and "helpers" of the Republican candidate for the Presidents of Donald Trump.
He stated that the Trump was not suitable for a post.
Treats states that erosion calendars for 'women, as well as for men'
The Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Balmer to produce a calendar for 2017 inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of naked celebrities, they set out to find the next generation of top models for their calendar for 2017 with naked muses.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of naked models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Obviously, he thinks that the calendar is too.
“We need to return to a demonstration of an eternal and classical naked figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body,” said Shaw in a press release declaring the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful artwork.
Models can present photos online or personally on open tapes in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscow will be able to distribute the marks on unfair Internet stores.
In Moscow, we're going to release a memorial that tells us how to avoid being a victim of an Internet store.
This was reported in Rossbuvenzardor, writes M24.
It is reported that the agency is preparing a mark that will help citizens to select the Internet and identify possible fraudulent schemes correctly.
The concept of the brochure includes several sections.
These will be general information and legislative frameworks, rules on the delivery of goods, ways of protecting their legitimate rights.
In the annex, recommendations will be made on how to formulate the claim correctly and so forth”, reported in Rossford.
The remembrance is being finalized to date.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the Rosmodover website of Moscow, and it will also be planned to issue a printed version and distribute to Moscow.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement calling the name of the second suspect in the organization of a diversification in Crime.
Detainees from Ukrainian and Russian nationals who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts have been detained.
Among them are Mr. Evgenius Alexandrović and Zechtei Andrey Romanović.
"They all give an acknowledge," said the communication.
Earlier, a resident of the Zaporozh district of Eugenius Panama, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Kruma, admitted his guilt for interrogation.
The FAS will fine Google with 438 million roubles.
The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine for the Google Corporation of 438 million roubles, referred to on the agency website.
"Gui has a rouble of 438 million roubles for infringement of antimonopoly legislation.
We hope that the company will execute our decision and pay the fines soon,” said FAS Deputy Chief Alexei Dácentko.
In the FAS investigation, it was determined that Google would supply the Smartphone producers that were sold in Russia, the Google Play application store only provided that other corporation applications were installed for the device.
These applications include a search engine which should be placed on the main smartphone screen.
Thus, the corporation violates article 10, paragraph 1, of the FZ “On the protection of competition” (a predominant abuse).
We are confident that the enforcement of the requirement will provide an opportunity to develop competition in the Russian mobile software market, which will favour our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act must be complied with by all companies whose products are shipped to the Russian Federation and by transnational corporations, including,” noted the Chief of the Russian Federation Communications and Information Technology Management Office, Elena Zaev.
The statement suspects 16 Russian shops.
The New Book Network was fined for selling a book "50 days before my suicide."
A network of New Books shops fined for selling Stace Kramer's book "50 days before my suicide," reports the City News Agency Mosqua.
As reported in Rosmodeward, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book may be considered “provoking or motivating for the suicide of children and adolescents”.
The Lenkini District Court has confirmed a violation of the established requirements for the dissemination of information products to children and has decided to impose a fine of 49 copies of the printed products arrested by the Rossford Administration.
The source in New Book confirmed that this was the work of Stace Kramer.
In March this year, it was reported that the largest bookstore in Moscow were checked for 50 days before I suicide.
In Moscow, Ernst's memory evening will be unknown.
In Moscow, the sculptor Ernst unknown will be remembered tonight, reports TASS.
The event will be held on 15 August at the Central Literator House.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say good-bye to the United States Unidentified in person.
It was therefore decided to set up this evening for those who wanted to mention it in their homeland,” stated in the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
It was noted that this was important for the widow of sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
At the evening, close friends of the Unknown, including the poet Eugenius Eutushenco, artist Boris Messererer, President of the GMII of Pushkina Irina Antonov, director Mark Rosovski, as well as the Minister of Culture of Russia, Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Department of Culture of Moscow, Alexander Kibovsky, deputy mayor of Moscow Leonid Peachnik.
Previously, it was reported that the relatives of Ernst of the unknown planned to carry out panic on the sculptor in New York, allegedly until 14 August.
The final consumer blamed: Who really buys the plates?
Lonely middle-year-old men love wine.
So far as you're not going to end with a section of the commentary by insults under the non-International Mussel, this allegation comes out of the actual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the rebirth of plates discussed is not a boom among the generation of two thousand who want to enter a new material object, but a nostalgic medium-year.
According to data, those who have recently purchased a wine album with a high degree of probability are between 45 and 54 years of age.
Moreover, those belonging to the 18-24 age group are least likely.
It is also not just an act of amateur gathering -- it is emotional: the older buyers have a slightly greater chance of holding their feelings (56% versus 53%) and enjoying loneliness (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov faithful?
If this blog was a television news report, the camera would follow me while I was walking down the center of the renewed Soho street, in a modest gray suit, and violently gestureing before stopping, laying hands and saying something inspiring like, "Yes, let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While Socho's heart slowly loses its charm and mud — hotels, cafés, paperchase shops are now filling up buildings once occupied by independent sellers — several music stores with fantastic specialists are still left.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to different people in some of these shops and try to assess their age and emotional attitude by means of observation.
Glasgo Stewart, 55 years old, where I went from Sister Ray (accounting two young women, three men of middle age) to Reckless Records (accounting: eight males aged medium, one woman probably over 20 years old), in London for a half day to meet and go shopping for a few hours.
He's a collector, am I asking?
"I think so," he says.
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These plates, shown above (he sent me by e-mail pictures, I didn't follow him home) go through the walls of his living room.
Its reason for acquiring so many albums and singles is partly due to its available income: he can now buy plates that he could not afford when they left and buy the items he sold when he was young and small.
"Much of what I acquire is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things for which I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are probably introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much.
That's my shortage.
Wez, 25 years old, who works in Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets are in line with the YouGov profile.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media, people who heard of their return and felt the duty to buy their old plates.
According to the conversations I had, people tended to get rid of their collections in 1998 or 1999.
The clients who once sold their own money to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their plastics," he says.
This could explain the boom among renaissance agents.
What about the supposed emotional importance of plates?
It's enough to spend a couple of seconds at a store like Phonica to realize that plastic stores offer comfortable societies to people with similar views.
According to Uez, some older clients are, inter alia, offended by a cash-free system.
Some adolescences may be shocked by the digital world and prefer to leave in the permanence of acquaintances for plates, objects that spark a memorial of a quiet youth.
"I think that sometimes it can be a filling of emptiness or possession of material things as a kind of reassurance," says Wez.
Since I'm the collector myself, I have it, and I think many people have it too.
It's a simple way to take over your head.
"We're like their social workers," said a colleague from the stallage plates.
A survey of ICM in April showed that nearly 50% of the people who bought a wine album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy wine do not have a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably have looked seriously puzzled by the brilliant ceiling with Bosanov's compilers.
The "Trophic" aspect of renaissance is what Johnny, 42 years old, observed working in Sounds of the Universe (Data Counting: Three Men of the Average Years).
"Someone came in recently and said, "I don't have a plastic player, but I want to buy a Radiohead plate so we can put it on our own," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it's certainly happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a plastic player."
They're younger people, they're not older, they're a little less than twenty who just get to know it.
Fopp, who's now taking almost the entire floor of the wine, has a much more diverse audience when I'm coming.
There are couples who are in their 70 ’ s, who are photographers, boys and women of middle age.
Although the atmosphere is less unforced than in the above-mentioned shops — the last synth and sexy post Wild Beast, not jazz improvization, it is a pleasure to see diversity in its clients.
None of them look particularly lonely, but painful psychological trauma is hard to find standing 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleonora, 27 years old, went to Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the different plates that were sold.
She's looking at goods, not spending money.
She doesn't make a lot of money, she says, so collecting the plates is not a very suitable option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simply, but beauty has been guilty of it, it's..." - it's embedded in dreams with sighs, overflowing with love.
I don't know how to explain it is really unique.
My last stop is a store, which is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of people who have been guilty: City fashioners.
While I create an illusion that I'm looking at jeans' cross-cutting shorts, I'm watching a group of teenage girls gathering around the Polaroid camera every minute before the father and his daughter start talking about the purchase of the Crosley player.
On the left is a staircase with Adel, Jeff Buckley, Amy Wainhouse, and Flitwood Mac: a mixture of modern styles and classics, binding plates for any medium collection.
No one sees — perhaps because they are mere ornament, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "cross" fault.
But given that any attraction to these subjects can mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the Soho deep for a while, almost nothing to complain about.
It's no wonder that the population layer, which is more likely than most people have more time and money than most, is the layer that spends most of the money on luxury, such as vinyl.
But while my findings show that the results of YouGov are accurate, at least in Soho plastic stores, they do not preclude the existence of a large number of women collectors and amateur women who are guilty, which exist in reality, in plastic stores and on online operations.
These people probably work all the time in school or office.
But they obviously don't spend the morning on Thursday walking through the shops on Bervik Street, passing plastic plates and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old false leader hanging over the shoulders of no suspected men of middle age.
Greenland’s Polar Shark — The Longest Spine Animals — Video Report

The French Court rejects the offer to demolish shops in Jungli refugee camp
The French Court rejected the offer by the Kale authorities to demolish dozens of self-delivered shops and restaurants in the Jungley camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At trial hearings this week, the Kale authorities said that the State should be able to remove a total of 72 self-sustaining shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to jump or sell tea for 50 cents (40r) or simplest dishes for a few euros in self-delivered restaurants.
Prefecture Kale said that those places should be dropped because they were a parallel economy that did not pay taxes and because they were carrying fire and sanitation risks.
The humanitarian teams told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, claiming that the free food offered by the pro-governmental association and other groups did not provide sufficient food for the growing population in the camp.
They said that autonomous shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lillah Court ruled that there was no legitimate basis for expelling the people who managed 72 business shops, but stated that the problems of Kalé prefectures “were fully understood”.
Judge Jean-Fransua Molla said that bachelors, cafés and restaurants played a far greater role than simply feeding people who live in extremely ugly conditions.
He said that spaces provided calm points for the meeting of refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by demolition was the book of Jungle at the camp, which does not work for profit and offers 200 lunches per day, English and French studies and advice on asylum for hundreds of vulnerable minors without escort in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the child cafe.
The letter sent to Guardian said that his closure would be “would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom were not older than eight years of age”.
Two charitable institutions, refugee assistance and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the Jungley camp had grown and exceeded 9,000 people — the highest in history — after a sharp increase in the summer.

Britain stops at silver in Regby-7 after the Fiji master class allows them to take gold
The British impressive series in Regbi-7 was crushed by the final impediment of Fiji's team at the final on Thursday night, when they were completely demolished at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class to own a ball, dissipation, evasion, play support, run lines and rude force to win the gold, their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was not too poor in the form of silver — the third one in Britain a day — and they could be proud of their efforts at the first Olympic tournament on Regbi-7, where New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were defeated on the road.
The diseased beating of Boks, 7-5 in semi-final earlier on the same day, could have returned to negatively affect them in the final.
But despite nothing, Fiji has won the 15-person team in this form as much as possible.
This may be some comfort for Britain — but probably not — that at least one British will hang on the neck of the gold medal tomorrow: Chief Trainer, Fiji Ben Ryan, former British Chief of Wimbledon.
It was a journey for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
They've lost only one.
These blows will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji started great for the fun to cut off British attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like pushing on a convoy of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Colinisau was diving in the corner.
Having four minutes in hours, Jerry Tway added another Tachdown on the right flank that had been implemented.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's magnificent attempt to intercept Lyon Nacarava has kept the man on top of Leon Nacarava from killing a third, but this has only delayed Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jas Veremalwah made a tachdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nacarava added another one after the resumption, and there was still more minute ... in the first half.
Vathemo Ravo then threw himself through a few more violent attempts to intercept Britain and took a line to get a glass.
The implementation led to a break between 29 and 0.
It looked like Fiji was born for the Regby-7 game, while Britain still owns the craft.
That's a lot of it.
Great Britain made mass replacements for half the game, and they sealed the Fijian dam... for four minutes, which was good for the first half of the standards until Joshua Tuisov passed after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed an attempt for Britain by making a tank in the left corner to make the account 36-7, but the game was long over the South Sea islanders whose fans sang, waving the flags and dancing in the tribunas.
The Fijin approach was not to be overjoyed.
Mata William adorned a Fijian cake that didn't need to be decorated, another attempt in the last seconds.
A whistle sounded, the Fijians hug themselves, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely conquered.
Previously on the same day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in its semi-final, and the U.K. was a little over South Africa in a strenuous semi-final, one of the attempts of everyone — the difference between the British reality.
Kyle Brown takes Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great leg work, broke the line and slammed it under the beams in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept Marcus Watson, a brother of 15 on the side of England's team, Anthony, has won — and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the fight of the cancer coach.
There won't be more exciting gold in these games, and that says something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy rises in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found their golden moment value on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of Robin Williams was always there as long as they were trying to get to the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the British sports annalysts, who got to that height.
Their superiority was absolute, eventually it was their 39th inconclusive speech, again unprecedented.
What we see is that two brilliant athletes sliding across the surface with the elegantity of the leopards do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
With every gold, a battalion of ready hands contributing to progressively growing victorys, which are important, and no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, had been diagnosed with cancer, didn't know whether he would live before seeing that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous thing.
I had urea bubble cancer, which is one of the things that they can operate, and they did it.
If they don't, he's going everywhere.
That could have been a pretty bad situation.
She's changing your vision for the future a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was fortunate that he could start treatment in early 2014 in intersezone, keeping the breakdown of the schedule minimal if it could be a correct expression in such circumstances as these.
I needed a payment, so I had to recover quickly.
It was a stimulus.
I was in the hospital and walked about 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said that there were quite a few steps.
That's how it starts.
It is a journey on its own, but it makes it a little bit more.
The next moment after their victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent the nervous morning talking a little bit more than usual in trying to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, the captain of the Artillery Pool, with the service behind the shoulders in Afghanistan, said, "I was a emotional collapse this week, maybe it's a little too much, but it means so much."
It only confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin, too.
It was fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank you so much for him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost any race in five years.
This couple sets up a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark’s teams began approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much in their stockpiles.
We've been a lot in the phase.
Helen called: 'Stay in the process, stay in the process'.
Now it's very important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do something amazing.
We weren't waiting for the fireworks today, but we were just waiting to be able to go out and get out and win this race, what we did.
A couple will need a year to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, on her own with the TV searcher for adventures by Steve Beckshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months to realize that I was a Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
Government has extended the destruction of sanctions products
The Government extended until the end of 2017 the destruction of foodstuffs prohibited by importing to Russia.
The decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo against countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions on the basis of the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the prohibition has been repeated and is now in force until 31 December 2017.
Russia is prohibited from importing certain agricultural products, commodities and food from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products have been banned.
The streamlining of food imported into the country by way of the embargo has been taking place in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of illicit products were seized from the sale.
Hunting for a “prohibition”
On Friday, rains and storms are expected in Moscow.
A atmospheric front will take place through the capital region, which will bring rains and reduce air temperatures.
During the day, the air warms up to 25 degrees of heat.
For example, on Saturday night in Moscow there will be a short rain, possible storms and wind breaks up to 15 m/s.
During the day, rain with thunderstorms and wind breaks is expected to reach between 12 and 17 m/s.
The rains with thunderstorms are also projected in the Orlovsk, Kurus and Voronezi districts and report “Dni.ru”.
The sediments are unlikely next working week.
WTO arbitrators' panel found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
Contributions exceed the commitments made by Russia when it entered WTO.
“This is the first time the WTO decided against the RF,” says the report on the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their opinion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that the measures of the Russian Federation were “systemically” or “extracted”.
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties to paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is described in the report of the Min Economy of Russia.
On 4 July it was reported that Kiev intended to welcome the World Trade Organization to the actions of Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is mentioned in a statement by the Government of Ukraine.
In May Financial Times, it was stated that U.S. behaviour in resolving disputes in WTO undermines the organization ' s principles of discussion.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, European Union and other WTO members because of the refusal of Americans to approve for the second term the South Korean Judge Chan Song Hwa.
In this regard, Russia will not resort to WTO on the question of Western sanctions imposed against the FRF.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It is now composed of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
In the Presidential Administration, the leader changed.
President Vladimir Putin appointed former Deputy Ivanov Anton Weino as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin has held a residue in the Presidential Administration and hopes that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Weino stated during the meeting that he considered the important anti-corruption work that had begun to be headed by the President of Ivanov and promised to cooperate with the Government.
Earlier, the Investigation had reported that the experts considered the resignation of Sergey Ivanov from the office of management to be transparent and understandable, and the restitution would not change in principle in the Kremlin administration.
They note that the leader who had been working with the President ' s administration for a long time has effectively built the work of the AP.
Instead, Anton Weino, Deputy Head of Administration, was a man who was well aware of the specificity of this work.
In Poland, it is not allowed to purchase fuel from Gasproma.
The State Polish Petroleum Gas Company PGNIG does not preclude that a few years later the supply of gas from the RF may become unattractive for it due to the reorientation of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice President of the Polish Finance Company, Bogoslaw Majetz.
His words are conveyed by the TASS.
"It's so likely that we don't buy gas at all in Gasproma," we're going to diversify our supply.
Within the next four years, the main deliveries for us will be East, CNG-terminals and Norway," said Majetz.
The Gasprom is currently dominant in the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had placed almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, which was 30 per cent higher than the 2015 level.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG purchases rose to 49.8 per cent, compared to 40 per cent earlier.
Recall that, on 22 July, the Polish Antimonopoly Authority did not agree on the establishment of a joint Gasproma company and its European partners in the construction of the gas pipeline “Northern Flow-2”.
This month earlier, Poland left the Gasproma request for 11 billion cubic metres of gas on "North Flow-2".
The Vice-President of the Holding Government, Alexander Medvedev, said that.
Auction on the capacity of the "North Flow-2" will be held in 2017 and auction is planned on its stack in the autumn of 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to take any action in connection with the Polish side ' s intentions to relinquish long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, and the Vice-President of the Government of the company, Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that during the first quarter of this year, the Polish only increased by 42 per cent the RF gas purchase.
Gasproma added that the fact that the application of Polish PGNIG to the Stockholm Arbitration Court had not yet been discontinued.
Previously, the Polish company had resorted to a judicial office to achieve a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
Recall that Petre Naimski, Commissioner of the Government of Poland for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to renew the contract with Gasprom for the supply of gas.
Polish contract with Gasprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish Government Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, stated that his country could renounce the supply of blue fuel from the east after six years.
He said that Warsaw planned to build a new liquefied natural gas supply terminal for the Baltic Pipe, which would connect the country to the Norwegian Shelf.
The “North Flow-2” provides for the construction of two sea gas pipelines with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia to Germany on the Baltic Seabed.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine's border with the Crime.
This was reported by Alexander Hug, the first GMS castle in Ukraine.
“I can confirm that the SMS has increased the number of observers in this area,” he said, responding to the related question of journalists, transmits the Newsty RIA.
According to the OSCE, the situation at the border of Ukraine and Crime is calm and there are no security incidents.
Observers monitored three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
The Network had a video of an airplane landing at Ufa at Yak-42, which flew outside the landing lane of 400 m and collapsed on the left wing.
The video published a 360 television station.
The PPP took place at 4.30 on Moscow Time.
Cras Avia's flight came from Sochi.
They were evacuated quickly to a safe place, no victims.
The aircraft itself were transported in a parking lot.
Ufa airport works in normal mode.
The Voil Department of Inquiry in Transport of the UKR has clarified the reason for the rigid landing of the liner aircraft.
The United Nations is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The United Nations Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in insurgent areas of the Syrian town of Aleppo.
All the parties to the conflict denied the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Steffan de Mistura, considered that the case was indisputable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations, to begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists have initiated investigations into reports of chemical weapons in the Syrian town of Aleppo.
The first information on toxic gas terrorists, allegedly chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
At that time, the opposition stated that in the area where the Russian military helicopter had been demolished on the day before, the aircraft dropped the poisoning bombs, but in Moscow these charges were described as the drop.
The Russian Ministry of Defence later accused the Opposition Group of Harakat Nur Al-Din Al-Zinki.
Soon it was known that there were two toxic bombs.
BBC confirmed that one of the victims.
"Some minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, the beginning of the burning of my eyes, it became hard to breathe," quotes the introduction of the eyewitness.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poisoning gas is confirmed by experts, action will be regarded as a war crime.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, stated to the journalists: “The evidence that this has actually happened is a lot”.
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is stipulated in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
While all parties to the Syrian conflict denied the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of chlorine use by the Syrian army against the “smart opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo is compounded by the daily shooting of its areas and by terrorists inhibiting the departure of the inhabitants.
According to Reuters, the United Nations expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in hostilities.
The current three-hour shadow regime in the organizations is considered “not sufficient to help almost 2 million civilians trapped.”
Staffan de Misturas of Humanitarian Affairs adviser Jan Egelann stated that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required to bring the sick and wounded to the city of aid and evacuation from there every week.
“We have to send volume cargo from a convoy of trucks in the area where roads are practically destroyed and those remaining are mined,” said Mr. Egelann. “But the Russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table.”
Consultations in Geneva between the representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” continue.
How Russia opened the "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle of Aleppo - the second largest Syrian city - Russia, on 11 August, announced the establishment of a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will take place daily from Thursday.
The establishment of “humanitarian windows” is intended to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and essentials to the city.
The decision of the Minoborna RF was taken against the backdrop of increasing international pressure on Moscow, requiring the dismantling of the military operation and facilitating the resumption of the negotiating process.
Four people were killed by a series of bombings on the resorts in Thailand.
Immediately a few explosions in southern Thailand broke out on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed, 19 wounded.
The episentre of the explosion was on the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, four nationals, not Russians.
None of the terrorist groups had yet taken responsibility for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs had hurried to state that the Islamists were not involved.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of the organization of the explosions.
Preliminary data from the local police show that the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they have been directed against the military leader of the country.
Attacks took place on popular tourist resorts, including the Patong beach in the Phouket area and the Hua-Hin towns, Trang and Surat-Tani.
After military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, an increase of 1.5 million over 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, and the Colonel of the Police, Chrisan Patanacharoen, reported.
At an early date, he added, but in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, countries are “confident that they are not related to international extremist groups”.
It's too early to make conclusions,' said Mr. Patanacharoen.
But we know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact, local diversifications, and we are trying to identify those behind them.
Explosions took place on the birthday of Queen Sikrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta regards the protection of monarchy as one of its main priorities, and the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to the Sitchić Srizopachacharoenrat Police General, the bombs were blown away by half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on lively streets filled with lunches by tourists in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four deaths was a Thai girl who traded street food.
The persons of the remaining victims are still unknown, but they are known to be residents of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai Police, there are four German citizens, three Dutch subjects, two Italian citizens and Austrian nationals.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, reported the Rosturism Press Service.
Local experts also link explosions with the referendum of 7 August, which supported 61.4 per cent of the population of the country ' s draft new constitution.
It was prepared by the Constitutional Commission appointed by the military junta.
The voters had to determine whether they supported a system in which the upper House of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role in the election of the Prime Minister of the country.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Recall that a military coup in Thailand took place on 22 May 2014 under the leadership of the commander of the Army of Pruita Chang-Och.
To that end, he said that the army had stirred up an ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military established the National Council for Peace and Order, introduced curfews and censorship, dismissed protesters and the upper House of Parliament.
How Bangkok was in a state of emergency
The Thai Government, chaired by the Prime Minister Jinglak Chinawat in January 2014, announced the imposition of a state of emergency in Bangkok and the capital provinces.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, in the centre of Bangkok, a Monument of Victory, where one of the major protests was held, there were two explosions that affected 28 people, five of whom were in critical condition.
Explosions made unknown on motorcycles.
The authorities strengthened security measures in the capital and engaged military forces to protect demonstrators.
The situation began in Sukh Log.
As “U” became known, the Government was invited to agree on a draft auction on the gold mining of Sukha Log with two key limitations.
It is suggested that auction should not allow a company where 25 per cent or more belong to foreigners and those whose capital would not be at least 25 per cent of the State party.
The industry does not expect the Government to rewrite the conditions, noting that many players are not at risk of taking a difficult and expensive project.
Auction can be announced in August and then in October.
Minorities have introduced the Government ' s project of auction and auction for the largest undeveloped gold mining site in Russia, Sukha Log (Irkuts region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), and have presented two sources of U.S. that are familiar with the situation.
The draft was introduced on Wednesday evening, clarifying one of them.
In the Minnature, the United States confirmed that the project had been introduced to the Government.
A representative of the Vice-President of Alexander Chloponnin, the supervisor, said that the project had not yet been submitted to the office of the official.
“The auction may be announced in August, immediately after the Government's order has been issued, and given the time limit for the gathering of applications for potential participants (at least 45 days) the tender may be held in October”, says Minorna.
According to the “U” data, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, as set out in the version, which was sent to the Ministries and FOIWA in July (the U.S.).
The first is the existence of no less than 25 per cent of the State party in the capital.
The second is the refusal of access to auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on investments in strategic societies.
According to the two draft articles of the FZ, as already stated on 2 August, the auction may prevent a company whose beneficiaries (25 per cent of the share and above) are not tax residents of the RF or have dual nationality.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, as Sukhah Log refers to the nephews of federal value (more than 50 tons of gold).
In the Minnature, it was confirmed that the project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies” but refused to comment on the details before the Government ordered.
The auction's claim for accrual participation was put forward by the Irkuts region, referred to the United Nations to the Nature in December 2015, and confirmed later by the Governor of the region, Sergei Levchenko, noting that it had been sent to the Minnature by his predecessor, Sergem Eroschchenko, “withstanding investment agreements with the “Rostehom”.
Those who lobbyed the restriction of aliens, the interlocutors do not specify.
"But it's in the spirit of time, not to control the largest gold deposit in Russia in the background of Western sanctions," reasons the U.S. interlocutor who is familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The Head of Nature, Sergei Donski, stated on August 1, that foreigners “may go to a consortium” if the claimants attracted them “as financial structures, technology partners”.
The U.S. interlocutors believe that it is unlikely that the Government will adjust the conditions.
The largest gold mining consortium of the PAO, under the control of the son of Sukha Log, is considered the consortium of the largest gold mining RAO Polus, under the control of the son of Sulayman Kerimóm Saidou, and “Rosseha”.
As the U.S. wrote, in July partners set up SS "SL Goldo", where Polus has 51% of its share, R.T.-G.R., 49%.
In Rostehe, the commentaries were abandoned, Poluce stated “U”, that “unconfidently, interested in this asset” and had all the competencies and resources necessary for its development.
“But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the declaration of conditions”, added to the “Pollus”.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision for the Government of the RF, was spoken by U.S. sources.
Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinros, which develops assets in Chukotka, stated that they could participate in the development of the Soogo Loga, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to the data, did not interest asset.
The Head of the Golden Industry Union of the RF, Sergei Kashub, estimated the US investments in Sukha Log in December 2015 at $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential claimants are not only intimidating investments but also the complexity of the project: serious stockpile and ore technology is needed, explaining “UP” interlocutors in the industry.
In the retirement market, the largest M&A deal, “CIT Finance Pension Administrator”, started the process of uniting four sub-controlled PNPs.
As a result, the NPF, based on the “Gazfond Pension Stocks”, will be created with an accumulation of about 373 billion roubles.
The launch of the procedure for the consolidation of four pension funds, KIT Finance, Promagrofund, Inheritance and Gasfond Pensions, reported yesterday to the owner 100 per cent of the OEA funds “KIT Finance Pension Administrator”.
“Reorganization shall be in agreement with the CB, subject to the requirement to deteriorate the terms of the existing treaties”, says the company's report.
The association is carried out on the basis of the Gasfond Pension Stocks.
As the genitor of this NPF notes, Oleg Bialoshitsky, the pooling of funds allows for several tasks: expanding geography of presence, concentrating resources for development, lowering costs, replication of the best practices of each fund and optimizing corporate governance.
He said that the indicative deadline for consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the NPF association, Gasfond Pension Stocks will become the largest player in the JPS market.
As of 31 March, the pension accumulations of the unified funds exceeded 373 billion roubles.
According to the accounts of the funds website, the beneficiaries of their owner, “CIT Finance Pension Administrator”, are currently Anatolia Gavrilenko (through under the control of the CSOs 65 per cent) and Gazfond (35 per cent).
However, the group itself started competitors much later.
For example, under the control of the O1 PNP, the “Being” group swallowed the Stalfond at the beginning of the current year.
This joint NPF is currently joining the Uralsib and the Russian Standard funds.
“Commoning into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to address structural tasks”, notes Nicolas Sidorov, PNP gentor.
Active work on the consolidation of funds has been under way since April in the Safmar pension team, the European, Education and Science, and the Regionfond should be influenced by the NPF “Safmar” before the end of the year.
In 2017, the NPF will be joined by “Documentation”.
“Integration of funds will enhance risk control, operational processes and expenditure”, noted in the Safmar pension team.
Several reasons may be attributed to the stalling of the foundations that CIT was awarded by the Pension Administrator.
Until recently, NPF was unable to purchase more than 40 per cent of the volume of infrastructure bonds to which the group was actively deployed.
Following the amendments to the TB Regulation in March this year, there are no more such restrictions for a number of emitters that meet the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, the entire graduation can buy one large player," says the director of the ACRA financial rating group, Yury Nogin.
Several PNP leaders from top-15 on assets are another potential cause of pause called the division of influence and consequently the appointments in a single fund to be agreed upon by the owners of the group.
Yesterday Anatolia Gavrilenko was not available for comments.
At the request of the UPF, the Gasfond did not answer either.
While consolidating funds is a labour-intensive and low-cost event, it will be justified for a long distance.
According to the Consulting Company ' s genitor, Sergei Okolesnov ' s Consulting Partnership, the Gasfond Pension Stocks are smaller, and accession will enable the stabilization of the base of other group funds.
In doing so, the more successful experience of NPF “KIT Finance” and “Promagrofund” in the construction of retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern PBS.
The requirements of the CBC for PNP processes and personnel are constantly growing, so duplicating infrastructure at four funds with a single investment is not appropriate, believes the Director of Corporate RA Expert Paul Mitrofons.
“The efficiency of reducing duplicate functions will unambiguously discontinue the possible costs of merging,” said Mr. Mitrofan.
The cost of merging the four funds of Sergei Okolesnov is estimated at RU 30 to 50 million.
“The cost of the four funds is about 400 million roubles per year, with the consolidation in the medium term of the budget actually halved”, Mr. Ocolesins is confident.
The Russian procategory had the finest dysneev film "Pet and his dragon."
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the soap dragon, the fascinating history and the cantri-style songs are enough to re-enter old-fashioned magic, says ELENA CRAVZOON.
A frightened baby picked up a dragon who became a human baby and a gentle baby-sitter and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his buddy Elliot, after a puppy of tales, plays the game with him and sleeps in a hug.
Six years later, he's grown up and he's in a bargain, and he's not going to be distinguished from another deliberate forest sorvant, Maugli.
In this form, Peta and detects a red-headed woman her husband, Grace Dallas Howard, while Gavin's Brigade (Carl Urban), the brother of her husband, is aggressively shattering the forest.
Now she'll have to not only believe that a dragon exists but also help him save.
Pete has an accelerated course of being a human being in the surroundings of Idilla Americans who wear shirts-gunheads, the moral code in the heart and smile more blind than in any advertising.
No character looks or acts too horrible to really hate him or to fear him.
Even Gavin, who has opened up the hunt for an untypical resident of the forest under his control, is far from being corrected by the evildoer.
The huge fuzzy dragon was also not scary, with the good face of the bouldog, the airliner swings of the wing, and the ability to become invisible.
Dragon's funny to screw, murmuring, even grunting, and, fortunately, he doesn't say, but he's always wanted to be smoothed, and it's profitably different from all the known cinematographic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner ensures such a high level of emotional involvement that at the most tense moments, there is a desperate start to cry in three rolls, not only for small spectators, but also for adults.
Impressively good and young Oax Figli's role as Pete, breaking between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtuously publishes a canonic grandfather who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did the director David Lourie make a fantastic cute reef of the forgotten dysnaeus film of Dragon Pete in 1977, a mediator from his nose to the end of his tail, and only a mixture of animation and play movie, and make it the most emotional film of this summer?
Not otherwise as a miracle helped.
Lourie, in fact, took two things from the original: the orphan of Pete and the dragon.
There's music rooms and a lot of weird jokes left behind.
In this good story, we read the features of Bembie, the Innoplanetite, and many other nice hearts of childhood paintings.

Of course, Pete and Dragon aren't as brilliantly beautiful as the same jungle Book, and there's no skillful evil that Kate Blanchet's had in her stepmother's role in the new Zolshk.

Alexander Sokolov's journalist RBC will face a new charge.
The lawyers of journalist RBC Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing an extremist structure, stated that the Prosecutor ' s Office had found a flaw in the case of their defendant.
We learned from the investigators that the Attorney's Office made this presentation literally yesterday.
We were scheduled to participate in the judicial session on the limitation of the knowledge of the criminal case, but the meeting did not take place, and the investigators informed us of the submission made by the Public Prosecutor's Office,” quotes Olgi Dines, counsel.
She reported that the Prosecutor ' s Office had indicated to the investigators that the qualifications of the case and the material collected were inconsistent.
The investigators will now have to remove the gaps in the evidence base and bring Alexander Sokolo's new accusation.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CL) will appear in the case, or will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, she shall clarify.
As reported by the U.S., Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June this year, it was reported that the investigation had excluded journalist RBC from the accusation the language of “deployment of political conditions towards instability” and “reflecting power illegally”.
ALECSANDR SYLBERT lived the Olympics in the Olympic village, inspected the Russian assembly house, lunched in the local dining room, and even passed the WADA test afterwards.
I don't think life here dies for a second.
Even at night.
The last startups sometimes end in midnight, after which the athletes need an hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, villages and evictions are being settled and evictions without stopping, as some athletes have completed their speeches and leave Brazil, and some of them, on the other hand, only arrive here.
At 7:30 a.m., the heads of all Olympic delegations are drawn to one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational domestic issues, the head of the Olympic delegation of the Russian Olympic team, Igor Kazikov.
It's a problem with hot water, so I'm sorry, with wagons.
We've been fighting for cleanness for a long time.
At first, no one was coming to clean up.
Then the clinics came, but they only got some stuff on the floor, and everybody.
They have the floors, you see, some kind of innovation.
Mol, you can't wash them humanly.
We know these floors are common laminates!
Anyway, the Clining Company has changed, and now it's OK.
The Olympics village is South Bouto, a bedroom area fenced on one side by mountains, on the other, an inspiring bulge, and a place filled with water.
And for reliability, there is still a two-metre iron fence along which machines are walking along.
In total, up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses may be placed in the village.
On one of the 18-story buildings, there's a huge Russian flag hanging on -- this house is completely confined to the needs of our collection.
Looking at a small foye at the entrance, you can immediately determine the problems that seem to be the most pressing for the domestic team.
Two advertisements hang on the record: "Please, don't throw paper in the toilet!" and from the hand, "I'll give you the badges.
It's the stake itself drowning in the tracts.
Their cheerful flower contrasts with the headlines of the brochures: “Principles for Infectious Diseases for Travellers in Rio de Janeiro”, “First aid in the injection, inspiritation, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiovascular reaction”, “First assistance with burns, heat strike, breaks and bleeding”.
The text is very encouraging.
For example: “Infections are accompanied by fever and subsequent healing.
However, not everyone will have a favourable outcome.
Of course, there is a medical centre at the assembly of Russia who is ready at any time to provide qualified assistance to the household, including relaxing and sporting massage.
On the contrary to the medical centre, our delegation's own headquarters.
At the door, an inspiring poster, "No matter what, we're going to win."
And, of course, verses:
All the arguments are absolute craziness!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Let's be less than us, the sweeter taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And for a further show of spirit, the announcement, "Dear Brothers and Sisters!
With the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all Russi Kyril, the spiritual care of the Olympic assembly of Russia is being carried out by the protoire Andrew Vladimirovic Alexeyev.
You can order moleb and other demands by telephone...
In general, there is a centre of meditation and religious rituals for all denominations in the village.
And the Russians, it turns out, in a privileged position, they have their own temporal.
Because of the load of elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs recommended for use during the fire.
And in the darkness he stumbled about the bodies upon which he lay.
Apparently, they were sleeping colleagues of the new Clining Company.
I believe they've decided to have a quiet hour right at the cold stage at any time to throw themselves at the washing of the innovative sexes.
On the fourth floor, I was looking forward to a meeting with a longtime friend, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, a coach of our battists, who brought them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
With a tutor, a European champion of Yan Paul’s, he kindly agreed to show his rooms.
We're living in two beds, of course, almost prize, but it's not critical.
Sanusela is on four, but it's spacious.
Sock, of course, ridiculous, in tissues, trust does not, but things can be put in.
"No, you're kidding, they're having tea!"'s hands are sprayed by the tennisist Svetlan Kuznetsov, which I met in the main dining room.
It is known as at least because it is a space of 2.7,000 square metres and is ready to accept 5,000 visitors at the same time.
It's a total of 60,000 meals per day.
The menu options are "The Greatest of Brazil," "The Cookies of the World", "Asian dishes" and "Pices, Macaron Arts."
The last version, as I watched, is very popular with our volleyballs.
Let's say I didn't find any soup in any of the branches of the giant restaurant.
What kind of soup?
It's good that I took Chinese with me, weird.
And the teapot.
But in general, to understand, we've got more food on the cortex.
Anything can be chosen here, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I've personally chosen a tomato sauce for a couple and a tomato chick.
A plate with its name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, and an indication of the food value and the availability of allergens, is located next to each dish.
I'm sure to admit that it was edible.
I don't know why this turn is always in the local McDonald's.
Sweet, relaxed, you could say "thick" athletes out of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends, representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They're fascinating the victorin, the winner of which is the T-shirt.
They're provoking, you can say!
In order to receive a gift, at least eight out of ten questions have to be answered correctly.
- A girl from WADA attacked me.
But it wasn't the attack.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic turmoil, of course.
The situation has already worsened on the second question, "If I received a notification of doping control, should I immediately go to the Doping-Control post?"
I'm talking about option B, "No, I have one hour."
I lost my vigilance, so to speak.
I forgot that WADA of weaknesses don't have to wait.
Anyway, we need to show up right away.
Well, at the seventh stage of Victoria, my situation became very critical.
I thought for some reason that if I found it difficult to observe balanced diet because of my density schedule (and I am, by the way, hard!), I could use bioaddies to get "added nutrients to improve my productivity."
An, no, no!
More precisely, the answer is so that it is not strictly prohibited, but strongly, in several proposals.
It's WADA that's not fair!
How's it going, Russia?
There's nowhere behind Ethimus, Ishinbaeva, and all of our uncovered team.
That's why I concentrated, and I won the unfortunate shirt.
Know ours as they say!
In a victorious mood, I went to the Fitness Center on the Neighborhood.
I got involved in counting the trainers.
He hit 250.
I was surprised to note that no Russian athlete was found in this accumulation of run - along tracks.
But maybe it's right?
Let him train who doesn't know how to play!
And in a nearby polyclinic, one of our guys was sitting there.
In turn to the eye specialist.
Don't worry, don't shoot.
In a polyclinic, like all over the village, wherever it is, the condoms are hanging.
Therein is an encouraging call, "Fallow the condo."
Further, only the iron that resembles the door castle and the condom made from the natural latex of the Amazon is ready to escape from the apparatus.
I took myself alone, to remember.
The athletes won't forget, they got 450,000.
The Olympic Village has a whole place of entertainment for the holiday and celebrating occasion.
A knowledge table reminds us that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million per day in various ways on athletes.
The center is flooded with video games, billiard tables, tennis tables, soccer soccer and hokkey, and strange devices like video trainers.
- I'm interested in a friend in the form of a Ukrainian collection, who is actively using a wild toy.
Of course, I could just say that I don't want to talk to a man in the form of a prefabricated Russia, and that's all.
Here, by the way, there's a strange situation in the eyes of the guys in the yellow blue.
It's the most gambled one.
It takes at least three hours to walk the entire village by checking into each corner.
But if you walk, not on the electric cars, you will be able to open the home of a Canadian collection with a elbow at the entrance and a garbage with the refrigerating bathroom, and a ticket office, and laundry cleaning, and grooming, and a flower shop, and a bench with everyday merchandise, and an e-mail with unique marks (only you can still wait for a turn from Chinese philatelists), and a bank, and a reception office, and a photosque.
And late in the evening, you're going to sit down at the olive tree that's brilliantly colored to remember the friends and relatives of athletes who have left the world.
And you're going to be under an accompaniment of a machine that's dissipating fluid to kill insects, thinking about an eternal one.
It's about the Olympic movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was watching Australians slightly punished by the American Dream Team, the real chillers went online.
Few people know that the news that Inna Deriglazov won the gold in the rapist on the XXXI Olympic Games, I got first.
Maybe I'm even the only Moscow who's seen how it happened, not counting those, of course, who was watching the carioca competition that night.
It can only be understood by a real fan.
Imagine the Deaf Night of Moscow.
The neighbors below, as always by the hour of the night, woke up and start blasphemously, but loudly shouting at each other.
And it's threatening to move furniture.
There's no time to go to the market and buy a new one, as the plumber asked.
It's not clear in the TV schedule, so it's just holding the "Match" control channels, "First" and in any case "Rossia" -- although it's almost meaningless.
"Russia" is a family of repetitions, the whole sport is something on record.
There's a live broadcast.
Hope, of course, on "Match" -- the whole night a young man shouted in news releases first about the great semi-final of Diriglaze -- Shanaev, then about the coming battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, basketball, U.S.-- Australia.
I can't say anything wrong about this decision, by the way.
Australians were equal, the first half won.
They put the Americans in the place of their own greatness.
As a result, they have lost, but as we now say, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but it's about to fight Dee Francis, and it's not changing on the screen.
In a light panic, I'm starting to post channels.
It feels like it's gonna be a second time.
Okay, let's go deep into the cables.
None of the thematic "Mothers" fencing.
Oh, I think the fight's about to start.
The texts and tweets of some sports sites don't fit me.
The drift surf produces an unexpected but brilliant result.
On the first site, it turns out that there is a direct technical broadcast of all competitions that take place at that time.
I'm calling for the fencing, I'm getting one for the gold.
Deriglaze's a great counter-attack, going ahead in the glasses, and it's obviously starting to pull away the time.
The Italian woman plays almost a whole break.
We're on one point ahead of the end for a little over two seconds.
DI Franchiska is throwing on Deriglaza, and retreating, time is over, Italian is pumping a peg.
Victory!
A few seconds later, the Olympic Massenger on the phone reports a fourth gold medal.
Well, I'm the first person to see it with my eyes.
The foolish, the faithful, the enthusiastic.
The Muslim Spiritual Authority (MML) of Tatarstan refuses to use Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, the captain of the DUM obliged his imams to carry out Friday sermons only in Tatars to make young Tatars learn their own language.
It is stated in the administration that this “in which case it does not violate” the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazani finds that Tatars do not understand up to 60 per cent of those who are foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves.
Imamas fear that their preaching in Tatar will not reach the whole audience.
Yesterday, the PLM of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the Republic only in Tatar.
According to Tatarstan muft, Camille Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to “learn their own language”.
"For those who say that it's hard, in every big mosque, we're going to organize Tatar language classes completely free," said Mr. Samigullin.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today, in all the mosques of the preaching, "should be in Tatar."
He recalled that DUM Tatarstan was publishing the magazine Shura with the typical preaching in Tatar.
Imam, who doesn't say Tatar enough, "may be thoroughly prepared for them."
The Tatarstan DOU brings together more than a thousand incomings in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to the muphthia, in the area of Friday, the preaching work is conducted exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, a number of mosques used mainly Russian in Kazani.
In particular, as the mufty pointed out, it was practiced in the Burnaev Mosque, the Zackaban, and the Eniler.
However, Mr. Mohamethschin emphasized that the leadership aims to ensure that all students have both national languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
"No harm to non-tatar Muslims can be said," said Mr. Mohamethchin, "the sermon itself is not a mandatory, essential part of the Namaz."
At the same time, the mosque itself will continue to read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons will be retained in Russian in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said "the United" that there was no serious threat of pushing the Tatar language out of the mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, he has reportedly not been used in the preaching work in the Republic.
The DPM decision was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT).
The head of the UKT Rynath Zachirov, a member of the UK, said "I," "Macheti is an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language had gone out of this area.
He noted that preaching in the Tatar language was only “the desire of the imams themselves”, but in the UTC compliment “deems it correct”.
The U.S. imams interviewed who preached in Russian are willing to carry out the decision of the DMA, but they believe that it will be difficult for the adherents to understand the clergy.
Both the Tatars and the Russians go to the mosque.
Many people don't understand the language.
They will, of course, be trembling.
"It will be necessary to rebuild," says the Burnaev mosque of Farhat Mavletdinov.
He said that even many Tatars are closer to Russian, because "Russian and in schools and in children's homes, on the radio, all over the world."
However, he believes that the mosques will be able to continue the lessons and lectures in Russian in other days.
We rely on Allah.
God will show you the way out of this situation. He has concluded.
But about 60% of us don't know Tatar.
These are Uzbeks, Tajikis and Azerbaijanis.
There are many foreign students visiting us: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we're four years old as Russian," he says.
He believes that in the Tatar language, the preaching language will be “to reach a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience”.
But we will be subject to the decision of the captive.
It's just the outcome of the sermon that's different.
But time will show.
"For example, it's only easier for me because the Tatar language is my mother," Gabdulla Galiollin concluded.
The former Director of FSIN was tried.
The Moscow Public Prosecutor ' s Office approved the indictment on the investigation of the DSG in the case of theft of budgets allocated to the Russian FSIN.
Alexander Reimer and his deputy who suffered damages amounting to more than 2.7 billion roubles will be brought to the court.
Alexander Reimer, former Deputy Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the Director of the Information Technology and Liaison Centre of the Federal Prison Service (FGUP CITOS) Victor, sent a criminal case to the Zamoskova District Procurator.
Depending on the role and level of participation in crimes, they are accused of the UKSG on Moscow at 3 p.m. of 285 UCF (abusiness of official powers that have severe consequences), at 4 p. 159 p.m. of the U.S.C. (frailure by the use of its official position, in an organized group, to a particularly large extent).
In addition, the Crivolapov is charged at 1 page 222 of the Criminal Code (unlawful acquisition and storage of munitions).
According to the UKR, in 2010-2012 these persons fraudulently abducted from the State Treasury budgets allocated to FSIN to provide the agencies with electronic monitoring systems for sub-controllers, called electronic bracelets.
In order to steal budget money, the panel participants have developed a scheme whereby the CITOS FGUP, which has been contracted by the relevant government, has produced technical means of control and oversight, including “electronic bracelets”, and has been implemented at prices that have been overstated several times.
Despite the fact that the CITOS FGUP did not have production equipment, buildings, buildings to accommodate the production capacity to create the completed "electronic bracelets" cycle, five State contracts of more than 3.3 billion roubles were concluded between it and the Russian FSIN.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion roubles of the Samaritan branch of the FGM have been abducted.
As a result, more than 140 million roubles of cash have been paid personally by Mr. Reimer in his office office from a co-party whose criminal proceedings have been committed to separate proceedings.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who was involved in the machinacs, had found an unknown origin of a cartridge to a prize gun, allowing him to be charged with additional charges.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, FSIN has filed a claim for compensation of 2.7 billion roubles for the accused.
Hakan Shukur's Footballist is suspected of being involved in the voyage.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former football player and then a member of the Hakan Shukur Parliament and searched two homes of his family.
The Star of Turkish football in the 1990s - the beginning of the 2000s - Hakan Shukur attacker is searched by the authorities for an attempt at a coup d ' état last month.
Forward, who graduated from a sporting career in 2008, is accused of joining an armed terrorist group.
This is the movement of Hismet, a society associated with a well-known Turkish religious figure and the opposition of Fethullah Gulen.
It is President Erdogan who believes that he is the organizer of an attempt to engage in a coup d'état, which took place on 15 July.
Fethulah Gulen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities require his extradition.
As reported by local media, a warrant for the arrest of Hakan Shukura has been issued today, and the police have already conducted searches in two homes belonging to the former football family.
According to the investigation, his father also entered Fetchullach Gulen's organization in addition to Hakan Shukur.
However, neither the former football player nor his loved ones were found there.
Now he and his family live in the United States.
In the home, Hakan Shukur, a soccer, defended the colors of several Turkish clubs and advocated the assembly country.
He spent most of his career at Galatasarae.
The list of overseas clubs includes Italian Torino, Inter and Palermo, as well as the English Blackburn.
True, he didn't have more than one season in any of them.
Khakan Shukur remains the most effective in the Turkish assembly attack, with 112 winners for the national team and 51 dead balls.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his office as a deputy because of the initiation of a corruption investigation around the Erdogan Party and its nearest environment.
According to the Hurriyet Turkish newspaper, on 25 July, at least 42 journalists were issued arrest warrants in Turkey.
They are accused of contributing to the military coup and ties with the opposition Islamic preacher Fethulah Gulen of the United States.
Given the gravity of the charges, the media may wait long prison sentences, from 10 years to several life imprisonments.
Histor Konchalovski wants to create a network of theaters only for domestic films.
"I would have set up a network of movie theaters solely for Russian movies, for which tickets were worth two to three times as much as for foreign production films," he said.
Mr. Konchalovski observes that Russian films are difficult to compete for a viewer with large Hollywood tapes.
We have more than 100 paintings a year, of which an average of 20 to 25 tapes reach the screens.
"And even they have a very hard time competing with "Transformers" and "World Man" in which huge budgets are loaded," said the film director.
Remember, on 1 July, the All-Russian Youth Educational Forum, Tavrida, began in Crum.
Participants include artistic professions and young professionals from all over Russia and from a number of countries in the Middle and Far East.

The new gene contractor promises to give Zenit-Arena by December 26th.
The new gene contractor of the St. Petersburg Stadium, who is to accept the 2017 Cup of Confederations and the 2018 World Cup championship, Metrody promises to rent the stage by 26 December, reports “RIA Newsty” with a reference to the head of the Federation Peace Championship Council for 2018 Wadima Tulpanov.
"Today, with the Russian Minister of Sport, Vitaly Mutoko visited the building, we had a master of Vadim Alexandrovs with us.
He said he'd give up the stadium by December 26th.
It's a serious Petherburg company, and it's never breaking the deadline.
"We and Vitaly Mutko are pleased to see and hear," quotes the interlocutor agency.
Beginning in St. Petersburg, Vital Mutoko had arrived to inspect the location of the forthcoming major competitions.
Mr. Tulipov also noted that the Sovfed Commission, which he chaired, would continue to monitor the construction of the stadium and attend the construction of the stadium regularly.
Remember, last night it was known that Metrody would complete the construction of Zenit Arena, which would cost about 5.4 billion roubles. The same company won the land-building trade around the stadium, the contract value of 2.4 billion roubling contracts with the Transstrore Corporation, the International Transforming Corporation and the Engineering Corporation of Transs.
Two other companies were not allowed to fight for the construction of the stadium.
For more information on the selection of the new gene contractor, see "Mestrody" material on the field.
In Miassa, Chile, the attorney of the former vice governor Nikolai Sandakova Constantine Aculic was detained.
As reported by another lawyer of the accused, Sergei Colosovsky, Constantine Aculic today was summoned to the Messah Investigation Division of the UKR to charge the one-hundred-and-year beatings.
At that time, Constantine Akulis left the accident as a lawyer to help one of his attendees.
"In fact, it was initiated against unidentified persons, and now that he began to defend Nikolai Sandakova, it turned out to be Akulic," says Sergei Colosovski.
Constantine Aculic became the lawyer of the Deputy Governor in early August.
In the meantime, half an hour before the call of a lawyer in the UPC, the Miassa side informed that the period on Monday was over to inform the fraud case that Nikolai Sandakova was accused of.
Remember, two criminal cases have been instituted against Nikolai Sandakova.
In the first (fraud case), it is incriminated by a pledge of RU 1.5 million to facilitate the appointment of the Mayor of Magnitohorsk Head of Administration of Lake Evgenya Tarasov.
The second criminal case relates to the bribe that Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from the Director of PNL, Piton, Igor Kaluguin, in the form of an illegal gratis provision of property services in the amount of at least 1.3 million roubles.
For more information on Mr. Sandakov's case, see "The Former Governor Requires to Combine His Cases."
The Russian copper company (RMC) is ready to assume social responsibilities and to pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMC has begun to modernize one of the oldest and ecologically polluted enterprises in the country, the Karabash medieval combination.
The Karabash plant was founded by an English shareholder society headed by Leslie Urkwart in 1910.
In Soviet times, this was an important industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually ensured the life of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, because of financial problems, production was stopped, which had led to serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabash medieval combination.
One of the main problems of the Karabash plant was also to be addressed - environmental.
By the beginning of the 2000s, Karabash was already known as a zone of environmental disaster.
The situation in the Carabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the enterprise was managed by the Russian copper company.
The company has begun to modernize production, which has gradually reduced environmental pressure.
This has recently been noted by the Governor of the Chelabin Region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited the first issue of July, “Carabashmed”.
The head of South Urala described the major changes that had taken place with the enterprise since Carabashmed moved into the RMC group.
The main modernization of Carabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sernocyst ceiling to catch up to 99.9 per cent of metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian copper company, the All Evil Levina, investment in the project was about 7 billion roubles.
The next phase of the ZAO modernization of “Carabashmed” was the reconstruction of the convertible.
The replacement of three converters, heatings, gas-propelled tract is planned for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016, a new 1 billion rubbish purification unit is planned to be launched.
In turn, taxes from the city of Karabash will also grow.
Over the entire period of the Tominian GOC project, from the start of construction to the second turn, the Federal Treasury will receive 8.9 billion roubles.
Once GOK has been introduced, tax revenues at all levels can be roubled to 80.9 billion roubles.
During the year of production in the Varnen district, the budgets of the various levels totalled 346.3 million roubles.
And that's in the first year.
"The longer the enterprise is working, the amount of the payment may be greater," added Valerie Ulanovsky.
In the RMC, it was clarified that in 2015 tax revenues from the Micheev GOC were close to 1 billion roubles.
However, the participation of RMC enterprises in the life and development of territories is not limited to taxes.
RMC enterprises assist in the repair and maintenance of schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, cultural and recreational facilities, and the construction of territories.
In 2016, a major social project of the Russian copper company in Karabasha was a major refurbishment and, in fact, a reorganization of N9 for 95 tutors.
The building built in 1960 was in an emergency condition.
Also in the area of the RMC Arena, there will be a landscape park with artificial ponds, underground parkings and overland parkings with 600 machines, cafés and sports shops.
The Arena RMC will allow for spectacular professional sporting activities at the international level.
But the main challenge of this project is to make exercise and sport available in comfortable conditions for people in Chalbinsk, especially children.

This is reported on Thursday, 11 August, by The Local.
He said that some teenagers told the staff of the institution that “someone in Copenhagen is organizing prostitution.”

The staff of the three Union member companies confirmed that such a project was being discussed.

WSJ: The U.S. is considering imposing sanction against the RF because of the breakdown of democrat servers.
U.S. officials are considering the introduction of new sanctions against Russia in response to the breakdown of the Democratic Party ' s servers, writes The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
In order to impose sanctions, the U.S. Presidential Administration, Barak Obama, will have to formally accuse the attack on the Russian server or the hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
According to the sources, the FBI and other U.S. special services are almost sure of Russia's involvement in cyberattack.
WSJ notes that the U.S. generally prefers not to name the hacker attackers.
The exception consists of a breakdown of Sony Entertainment Pictures database in 2014, for which the DPRK was officially responsible.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying sanctions for those who implement or promote cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be prolonged, writes a publication.
Even if officials concluded that the hackers had acted with the support of Russia, they would have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose information.
They have to determine whether the incident is so serious that it will exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
It was previously reported that the Barak Obama Administration allowed sanctions against a State whose hackers hacked the servers of the Nazi Democratic Party.
WikiLeaks published an electronic correspondence of the National Democracy Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in hacking.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
The FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles.
There has been a violation of the competition in the mobile apps market.
Antimonopoly proceedings were initiated at the Yandex initiative.
The Russian company asserted that Google provides Smartphone producers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited the introduction of applications from other developers, in particular Yandex.
FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company abused the dominant market position and imposed the mobile device manufacturers to install with Google Play other applications.
Following the review, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to order Google, informed the FAS leader Alexei Decentko.
The penalty shall be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that the Competition Protection Act should respect all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to examine the solution first and only then determine further actions: to implement it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a violator of the competition law in September last year and ordered that the treaties be amended until 18 December.
But Google didn't agree to that.
Since then, the company and the department have been conducting judicial proceedings.
At the FAS, it was noted that despite the fines, the possibility of a world agreement was discussed with Google.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This was the opinion of the Mobile Research Group, Eldar Murtazin, the lead analyst.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would not affect the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

Snapchat is criticized as a cartoon for Asians.
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some viewers say it's racially indifferent.
Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and play with the individual ways that are bound to absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character to pick up Roy Liechtenstein's painting.
Lenses are rude, distortive tools that produce over 30 million adjusted selphis a day.
Any errors are rapidly becoming common knowledge.
The Snapchat Lens were exposed to criticism in the past when they were accused of being advertising a dark skin of the person or encouraging the evaporated persons as an ideal of beauty.
So when some users this week offered a lens that gave them slanted eyes, crooked teeth and tumble cheeks, some critics thought it was a racist cartoon on Asians, "siltolics."
They wondered whether these repeated contradictions pointed to the more serious problem of a company related to diversity.
Communications and resentment in the reports on The Verge and Motherboard were distributed on Wednesday the following day after Snapchat had declared that it had been removed.
The company commented that the line was designed to respect anime characters, not as a cartoon for Asians.
However, experts who know about racism are not heard, Linza reminded of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others totally rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about photographs was actively shared, said that the linza was “insulting and at least awkward”.
She added that “it was hard to argue with the comparison side by side of a very rough cartoon on Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow, but highly disgracefully yellow.
Snapchat is not the only company going through these cultural bridges.
The American culture seems to be involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from corporate conference rooms to Hollywood and the devils that we all carry with ourselves.
And the immense audience of young people in Snapchat -- who are more racially diverse than their older generation -- can mean that they are more likely to wait for understanding.
When one of the Snapchat lens creates an image offensive to the user, then, in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Joe said, "it's much harder to remain unnoticed as it used to be."
On Thursday, Joe, the produce manager and the engineer who works for the medium, decided to remove their record in Snapchat and encouraged others to do the same.
In the medium article and in the telephone interview, she said that she believed that racial contradictions were the cause of insufficient diversity in the recruitment of staff in Snapchat.
The ju was mostly criticized by the white leadership of a company consisting only of men and finishing its article by the Hashteg: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Joe, who herself is an American of Chinese origin, wrote: “As for them, there were not enough people in the state to make such decisions, or they do not have white people, but they do not hold positions where they can speak safely and openly.”
Other viewers share her viewpoint by expressing displeasure that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, stressing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but, according to the trusted person, the company had recently hired a convert to focus on the underrepresented segments of the population and to actively attempt to involve domestic resources.
For her part, Joe said that she would keep her record in the Snapchat closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to tell them they won't do that."
Military leadership distorted IGIL intelligence, reports the Congress Commission
The U.S. Central Armed Forces Commanders changed intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as well as justification for the events on the ground, reported to the Congress Commission in a report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group established by the Republican chairpersons of the Committee of the House of Representatives for Intelligence, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Expenditures found “the widespread discontent” among the Intelligence Service analysts of the Central Command, who claimed that the leaders had certified their assessment of American actions aimed at winning the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centk, is the main military office in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Intelligence documents approved by the highest command of Centcom have generally been more optimistic about US anti-terrorist actions than evidence from the scene and were stablely more optimistic than the analysis provided by other special services,” said the news report.
“What happened in Centcom is unacceptable: when the highest authorities seem unreasonable, our military are suffering,” said Ken Calver, a Republican of California, member of the House of Representatives.
Leadership problems in Centcom are at the top of the organization.
The 10-page report deals in detail with the shortcomings that have arisen constantly in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing American actions aimed at training Iraqi armed forces provided by Central Command.
Although he did not contain the final evidence that members of the Obama administration had ordered the falsification of reports, he argued that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership compelled them to be more optimistic about the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as IGIL or ISIL.
“In the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony from the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than real events,” reported the report.
For example, the Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation this is known for certain," said a statement by a member of the House of Representatives, Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the U.S. Central Command's highest Intelligence Manager fake the intelligence of the command to reduce the threat posed by IGIL in Iraq.
The Republicans set up an operational group when they learned that analysts expressed concern that the Islamic State was falsified by the intelligence.
As the investigation progresses, the more developed data will be followed by the report issued on Thursday.
The Pentcom's Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence conducts an additional investigation that has not yet been completed.
Representatives of the democratic party in the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States of America published their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Operational Group.
“In 2014 and 2015, Centk established an excessively closed intelligence procedure for IGIL and Iraq's security forces,” asserts the statement by the member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, the chief representative of the democratic party in the committee.
This procedure, according to Shiffa, “restrained the issuance of intelligence documents”, damaged the moral state of analysts and “reflected inadequately the divergent views”.
But Schiff and Democrats claim that they have not found evidence that the White House has tried to force the Centcom analysts to reach their conclusions under “did or political interpretation”.
Preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast portal.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector of Pentagon, opened after the analysts of Centcom.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress while the investigation of the Chief Inspector continued.
But he said that “experts sometimes differ in the interpretation of integrated data, and special services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital topics of national security”.
The results of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing in Iraq and Syria (as now asserts by the increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
However, last year ' s statements raise doubts as to whether President Obama could rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism of intelligence in the Islamic State reiterates disputes that took place over ten years ago, when a research article was written by a research analyst at Centcom Gregory Hucker, stating that the Administration of President George Woker Bush, because of the protest of many analysts, had expressed support for a small number of troops in Iraq and had not thought that it would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hucker also played a key role in the protest caused by the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, according to officials, the Huker team concluded that, despite public statements of reverses, air traffickers on oil-based plants belonging to the Islamic State did not lead to a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary oil plants to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not distributed outside the Central Command, as reported in September in Times.
The then commander Centcom, General Lloyd J. Ostin III, was criticized last year after the testimony of the Senate, which many members of the deputies considered overly optimistic as an assessment of the war.
General Ostin resigned in April and was replaced by Hen. Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.
The United States is winning 4 consecutively in the female hokkee on the grass, thus getting closer to the critical confrontation with Britain
Katie Bam, who once killed three naked in the uterus, which ended with a victory over Japan with a 6-1 account, opened the account on Thursday with the first two heads for the U.S. female hokkey team on the grass when the Americans won over India's 3-0 team.
Five heads in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bem, 27, claims she would not be sure if she had done something like that.
"I'm not gonna put it in my mind," she said.
I'm not really of the people who track their naked faces.
That's what she knows: the count of the Americans from 4 to 0 in the Olympic Tournament, and they're competing for the first place in their group with Britain, which remains invincible after the failure of Japan, with a 2-0 count on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last first tour game.
Both teams claim for a quarterfinal, and the result of the game will determine who will be the first in their team of six teams and who is the second.
The winner will avoid meeting a strong team of rivals from Holland, leaders of another group, a little bit of weather when the games of quarterfinal begin.
However, Saturday game shows that the Americans here made their unexpected series of noises four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams in London’s games.
Bem was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time, took Hokkey on her grass when she was three (older sisters playing this kind of sport in Drexel), and joined a national gathering at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed Olympiad 2008 when she did not pass the selection tour into the final composition.
Then came 2012, when everything went wrong with her and her teammates.
Next year, Coig Parnham, Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything started to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training," said Bem.
In London, we did not have the productivity that we now have.
We've completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bem opened the account in the first half of the game with a bastard hand at a short distance.
India came to play without a single win in the tournament, but the team was surprised to be rigid and kept the account 1 to 0 until the end of the third period, when Bem took the initiative into her hands.
She made a long walk with her ball down the left side of the field, then spiral went in and sharply sent the ball to the gate, thereby giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa González added a final head in the middle of the fourth period.
The dry victory was the first tournament for the United States gate, Jackie Briggs, who missed one bare in each of the first three wins.
She's hit.
So is Bem.
"We're in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how good it depends on the outcome of the Saturday Game.
In the midst of the hostility of the Olympic Games, the “den” of the leaps on the Batuta
Wherever you are, no matter how long you are, it's the Olympics.
Rio events seem to be constant and inevitable, and it's a freaky combination of competition and aspirations.
It's like the Olympic fire itself, and there's the burning torch that goes from the rayon to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triatlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper or listen to your neighbors in turn in the cafe and not hear about Simon Bayles, Katie Ledeka or the hostility between Michael Felps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who first participated in the Olympic Games, a beauty with holes on the cheeks, could well be among the celebrities that are shown in the Prime Times that sponsors and vivid advertising roles, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a fictitizer.
But 28-year-old Doulie from Lake Farest in California is fighting for gold in Olympic battalion.
The Olympic Fire does not cover all events equally.
Further from the centre, partly in the shadows, are those sports that are not generally recognized: pneumatic gun shootings, bow shootings, Badminton, Tkwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I'm allowed to be silly in defending my personal passion, let me draw your attention to the modest practitioning of the leaps on the battut.
Although battoo jumps have been the Olympic Sport since 2000, when they were debuting in Sydney, they have received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed have not been aware that they actually belong to the Olympic Sports.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States was sending athletes to compete, they never won the medals in the battalion, and their athletes did not go to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russian tend to share male rewards, while Chinese and Canadians are female.
The Dan Dune of China and Roise McLennan of Canada will protect their London gold medals this year.
But leaps on the battuty have a ballm of outsiders, in particular because for uninformed ears, they're more affiliated with a circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I must admit that I'm not an expert, but just a landed enthusiast.
They really have a comic potential — a leap of endless jumps — but also an elegance of gymnastics and leaps into water, two kinds of sports that they mostly combine.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín" meaning "temple for jumping in water."
Speaking for victory, they jump on a giant battut, flying almost 30 feet in the air, and they have to carry out a series of acrobatic tricks (wheels, straps, and salto) before final landing on their feet.
They are assessed according to the performance, complexity and “flight times” of the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most widely distributed Olympic course is forward.
Claimants on the medal must go further, faster, higher, and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes finishing, and sometimes back and forth, down and down.
They seek not only the finishing line or the launch wall, but also, in view of the telecamers, the other teasing scene: the world record or the Olympic record.
It is a strong desire to be noble, admired, even fanatic — and it is enough to make even a viewer to tear his tears.
But it seems to me to be somewhat tired of watching the Games.
He's a battalion jumper.
The direction of the battutist is upward.
Move forward is not a target.
He or she jumps, seemingly vague, like an astronaut, flys upwards, then downwards, then without effort again upwards.
And they, of course, are not without competition or difficulties, but throughout the entire programme, there is no crazy zeal for the finish, no jumps of length, only a strange, elegant disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the most closest to Zena of the Olympic Sports.
Women ' s qualifications and then the finals will take place on Friday afternoons, broadcast on East European Time Day, males on Saturday, also an hour.
NBC will transmit the final to the day programme from 14:00 to 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected to be seen easily in the overall landfill.
And if the growth of consciousness can be achieved only by adolescence and objectivity — as according to Wall Street Journal, recently suggested by majesty men from the United States — Dooley is only waiting for its newly admired mob of fans.
"The generation protests" in Ethiopia, the old U.S. allies.
Violent protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators requiring political change in Ethiopia faced the Government ' s violent opposition.
Eyewitnesses say that dozens of protesters were fatally wounded during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of fracture?
It has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong west ally with a fast-growing economy over the past decade.
In recent months, however, anti-Government protests have shocked the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
Just in the last week, thousands of people have gone to the streets, demanding radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s reaction was cruel.
Eyewitnesses claimed that the police officers had shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video recordings from protest sites allegedly withdrawn at the end of the past or early this year show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they are handed down to the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It was always difficult to keep this country from breaking up, and it would be even more difficult, ” said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn of the International Research Group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated African country after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and almost no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably — even a new suburban train in the capital city of Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy — human rights organizations were constantly referring to government repression - the opposition in the territory of the State was suppressed by the fact that the dissidents had been silenced.
Many of them were sentenced, imprisoned, killed or expelled into remote deserts.
But it can change.
“If people constantly suppress and leave them with other options except for protest, there will be a revolt,” said Seyum Teshome, a lecturer at the University in Central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
The generation protests.
Complaints are numerous, from land use to the seizure of government coalition.
Following the highly criticized elections last year, the Government party and its allies have completely stemmed the opposition and are now overseeing 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tension along the Eritrean border is increasing; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, which have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may attempt to use disturbances and rearm.
A number of factors explain why the bitter feelings that burst into the heart for several years are now being ignited.
The first one would seem completely harmless: smartphones.
Over the past few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate in social networks, as cheap smartphones have become common and Internet services have improved.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the possibility of communicating through the proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this was how they organized themselves for protests.
Second, there is greater solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara, from mostly the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, has prospered in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But it's also changing.
"We'll act together at the same beginning," said Mulatu Hemech, the leader of Oromo.
The major protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromo.
Many from Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by the Tigray ethnic group, which is about 6 per cent of the population and which controls military and intelligence services, trade and policy.
A third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, up to his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have foreseen the danger.
Analysts claim that he has particularly skilledly recognized the first signals of discontent and used spies to obtain data and clear opponents.
“The current regime lacks sound sense,” said Abdi, analyst of conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Heilemariam Desalen, came from nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was born from the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, Heilemariam, southern Ethiopia.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by Tigers.
Many fear that this will lead to more bloodshed.
For the last time, Ethiopia had experienced such turmoil in 2005, after thousands of people protested that, as analysts had said, there appeared to have been elections that the Government had overturned and then falsified.
In the aftermath of the repression, many Protestants were killed, albeit in fewer numbers than in the last months, and this period of turmoil has passed relatively fast.
The development experts expressed appreciation to Ethiopia ' s leaders for the far-reaching development of infrastructure, such as a new urban train and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it is obvious that this has not stopped the growing domestic discontent of the Government of Ethiopia.
It takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, Amhar city, attacked Tigray-owned enterprises and the anti-Tigra hatred in social networks became comprehensive.
Analysts claim that the protesters are making the United States and other Western allies uncomfortable.
The American Government had used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it had recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its allies to lose power in an already volatile region.
"And on this tightened rope it's hard to pass," said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his claim that IGIL was founded by Obama, "sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to mitigate the last conflict that covered his pre-elected headquarters on Friday, stating that he had jogged several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton had been “the founders” of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The clarification raised new questions regarding the skill of the candidate for the presidency of the Republican Party to speak wisely to the American people.
It also made his deputies, who tried to protect him during a period of turmoil, uncomfortable because they had to explain what he probably had not meant.
Speaking of this assumption at Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his approval on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton founded the IGIL.
But in Twitter early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just riding.
This post was a direct contrast to the claim made only a day earlier when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his charge.
When Hugh Hughitt's radio conservator tried to help Tempu soften the speech by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy the IGIL, the candidate from the Republican Party did not take advantage of the opportunity.
The last scandal broke out when the Trump tried to reorient its campaign against the economy in the background of a decline in rating.
The Trump and Clinton spoke with competing talks about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back on that subject again.
Once again he used Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to an increase in taxes, and he said that he felt her speech was boring.
The trump used sarcasm earlier as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he gained general criticism, almost putting the idea that Russians should break Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his comments, saying, "Of course, I'm kidding."
Such an approach allows the Tramp to go beyond the political speech allowed and to take its words back, if necessary.
"I think it's his way to test the responses of his worshipers, to watch them act, and then to explain them in one way or another, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, an expert on communication, conducting an analysis of the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is careful in his speeches and knows that they're vague enough to interpret them differently.
Instead of softening the voices for a broad electrator, the Trump has taken an even more delicate tone in the last days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that the Trump is going down to Clinton with a high hurdle in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and going with her level in Florida.
Although Trump typically tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But since the Trump had become a target of greater attention in the last months of the presidential campaign, his jokes made his faithful allies uncomfortable: they had to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his statements were.
Rudolf U. Juliani, former Mayor of New York, who is one of the most famous deputies of the Trump, made serious efforts to protect the candidate for an interview given by the CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political commentary," said Juliani when he was asked about the validity of the Trimp claim that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama IGIL was an almost unknown tiny organization, he called it a non-threatening, totally unfair, and that's why it happened, because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most middle-statistic republicans believe that the Obama administration, in which Clinton was the secretary of the State, allowed IGIL to develop because it was not able to settle the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to a meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media in Twitter for the loosening of his words and bias against them.
He scoffed at "poor miserable" television experts who tried to solve him, and said, "They are weak."
Some democrats have ridiculed the Arbitrations of the Trimp as justification that he is not a presidential.
Someday, the rubbed caffeine comes back to Greenpeint.
Verb's Caffeine was a blunt, hosting only cash space in Williamsberg, which didn't have Wi-Fi, but served a good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was stripped out of her room with a windmill on Bedford Avenue.
The Soup Sheri Magazine, who took up Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in the renewed city.
Artist Molly Krabapp wrote in Twitter, "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap store."
But while New York is constantly changing, it's in turn updated.
Verb's restored caffeine opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verbee has Wi-Fi and takes credit cards, but there are some of the same staff members and a similar simple atmosphere.
Besides, coffee is still good.
The new Verbas is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, an old caffeine officer who is the owner and the general manager in the new place.
He started working in Verbet in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to offer him a new place, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, 36 years old, has left a lot behind.
Verb is working with the same baggle distribution and bought the same cafe car model.
It's even fitted in the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu presents sandwiches with bacon, eggs and cheese, and there is a topping of capers or roasted onions.
There's some brown rice dishes.
No more beer is served in the caffeine, but they're getting freshly strangled juices.
Nine months later Rodriguez said that he drew attention to the constant flow of old permanent clients.
"Many former customers have also issued Williamsberg prices," he said.
In one of the recent resurrections, Rebecca Oliviair was one of such clients.
Olivieira, who was 34 years old, used to live in Williamsberg and often visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpeinet, she was still going there.
After the Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere that implanted me in Verbee," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, even though that day she ordered a purchased tea, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, was loyally visiting Verb, since 2003.
He went to work and ordered the same.
"Fifteen minutes eighth, every day I came by clock, and for me my beigle was cooked with oil and all the nails," he said.
Rodriguez told me he wanted to experiment and put new dishes on the menu.
Today, Rosenthal is still doing a regular order, but he's ever going to change something with bacon, eggs or cheese on the beigel with all the patches.
Rodriguez said he wasn't insulted that the store was washed once.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Sheri proposed to make a special soap for Verba, using a caffeine made in a cold manner as a ingredient.
"I think we may agree to their offer," said Rodriguez.
The permanent residents of Greenpoynt of Polish origin also loved this caffeine.
One of these new clients translated a menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the windmill so that his new neighbors felt desirable.
The new place has other benefits.
The local dot for the sale of juices plans to pour on bottles and sell coffee prepared in cold manner.
It is likely that a neighboring building will join the caffeine.
For many customers, it's enough that the new Verb will put their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a permanent client and told him that he was killed in grief when they were closed.
When the caffeine opened in a new place, Whitt said that when he entered and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
"How long I wanted to feel that smell," he confessed.
Depressive meal of depression in the Fleet Trail
In March 1933, shortly after the reign of President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Cabinet.
As a guerman, President Roosevelt loved the fashion dishes of the Fifth Avenue, such as the Fua-ga and the Meriland Skull Soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: bulging eggs in tomato sauce, potatoes, and pudding desserts from blackwood.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
Spouses living in Brooklyn Hates are specialists in the history of food.
The last book Kowa, "Rague Chinese" was devoted to the Chinese kitchen in America, and Zigelman told the story of life in a rented apartment in the Lower East Said through food in her book The House 97 Street of the Fruit Garden.
Their new joint work "Fleet Trareza", which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American food in the Great Depression.
In displaying some degree their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny simple diner in the Fletayron quarter, which has been working since 1929, the year of Birge collapse.
Zigelman, 54, ordered olive cheese and sandwich with pieces of olives, and Coe, 57, took an turkey, potatoes, and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roll, the couple considered it a suitable starting point for discussion about food in the age of depression.
"Rulets were in great demand," said Zigelman.
There was a peanut roll, a liver roll, a bean roller.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to grow.
Imagine that you ate as much peanut as you need for dinner.
Cow's martyrdom.
"He must have been in his stomach with a stone," he said.
During the years before the depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Women ' s groups were cooked for men working on the farm, and the fresh-burned pie was given for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans," said Coe, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The same was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes, such as rolls and bakers, became the main foodstuffs; bakery is a "pretty way to dispose of meals," said Zigelman, "because cooks could hide non-appetite ingredients under the thick sauce layer.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dryfruits.
The meat, for many years the former base of American food, has become economically distributed with luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutrient value have become more important than taste and even cooking.
In research for a book that includes recipes, Zigelman prepared a meal of that era: a baked bow frozen with peanut oil.
"This addition to the lunch table has not been successful," said Kow.
Zigelman added, "It was very weird."
The peanut butter does not fit the liver onion at all.
This was characteristic of many household prescriptions.
More than ever before, domestics professionals — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Bureau from 1923 to 1943 — have managed the country’s food habits.
After publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budgeters”, to take a challenge and to transform a pot like carrots spaghetti into tasted dishes.
"Fleet Pareza" is a party of interesting historical facts.
Particularly peculiar to the Government's reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Guver's position in the spirit of "noisy eating pie."
Publicly boasting about the simple farmer's state of Iowa time of his childhood, he was fed like a delicate millionaire to which he became.
"He liked the continental kitchen, for example, fish with a gorgeous sauce," he said to Coe.
He ate almost in a golden dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantasticly ripped off of reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleonor, had not asked him to set an example in his own stomach.
As the book explains, Eleonor Roosevelt hired an economy that was completely uninterested in taste, and that led to the White House “to use not only the most depressing food in Washington, D.C., but sometimes the most repugnantly prepared.”
Many of the kitchen receptions of the age of Depression were forgotten as soon as the country reappeared.
Their legacy is our constant focus on caloria and nutrition, says Zigelman, and how science was used to cook food.
They say that when they wrote the book, they better understood the food habits of Zigelman’s mother — that she could not throw out food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of negligence towards food," said Coe.
Zigelman recalls, "She's seriously poisoned people."
There was one unpleasant case of prophylition.
When the plates in Eisenberg's were deserted, they and Coe got a dessert that was cooked at home, a dessert from the blackwood that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"It's called the Chronicle Muss," said Zigelman, adding that it was a widely distributed reception to give modest recipes bro names.
There were no smashed plums, only blackwood, a little torment, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
All reluctantly plunged the spoon into a soft, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was pretty good.
Coe asked for two supplements.
By the voice of the trusted budget writer, he said to his wife, “Would not be confused by a few rubbed walnuts.”
Arrest of members of the mass fight in the Hawan cemetery extended until 14 November
The Presen Court left the mass fighters in the Hawan cemetery until 14 November and granted the relevant application for investigation.
In the case, 14 persons are held as accused.
Recall that on 14 May, a mass fight took place in the Hovan cemetery of several hundred people from Middle Asia and the North Caucasus with weapons that killed three people.
Alexander Bocharnikov, former leader of the cemetery of Yuri Chabuev and lawyer, co-sponsor of the Health Nation, is charged with murder.
The issue of the second pension index in 2016 may be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on 12 August by the Vice-President of the Government of RF, Olga Holodec, during the visit to the Brensk region.
We have specific parameters to improve the pension in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
The economists are now undergoing half-year outcomes, and we're going to complete this work in the next two to three weeks, quoting Interfax Holocaust.
Commenting on the six-year upgrading scheme proposed by the head of the Strategic Development Centre, Alexei Kudrim, the Vice-President reported that the topic was not addressed in the Cabinet.
At the end of July it was known that the Government had agreed on a position to fully index pension payments in 2017.
Kamen and Grigorian went to the end of the shooting competition with a small caliber rifle.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamenski and Cyrill Grigorian went to the finals of the shootings from a small caliber rifle from the position lying on the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to the TACS, Sergei Kamesky has recruited 629 points and took the first place is a new Olympic record in his qualifications.
Cyril Grigorian became the second one, 628.9 of them.
Eight best athletes went to the final.
Kamenski is the world recordman in this discipline (633).
The Turkish Oppositioner Flethulah Gülen requires an international investigation into the treachery attempt in Turkey.
“I demand that an independent international commission investigate the attempt to coup d'état,” quotes Gulen, a French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish Opposer also stated that "if any part of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gulen denies involvement in a coup, emphasizing that his organization has never claimed political power.
The Istanbul Court had previously arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fetchullach Gülene in a standstill.
Recall that the military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of 15 and 16 July.
Gilead Companies will reimburse the costs of legal services during the dispute for the hepatitis C patents with Merck
The Gilead Sciences Inc company has the right to receive reparation for the costs of the lawyers it had incurred in connection with the patents of hepatitis C with Merck & Co Inc, a federal district judge.
In June, the Gilead company was released from $200 million for violating the two Merck patents related to the medications of Gilead, the sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the American judge found a number of violations by Merck, including oaths and other unethical actions.
When speaking on Thursday, Judge of the U.S. Federal District Court, Beth Labson Freeman said that the Gilead company had the right to reimburse the costs incurred during the appeal.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which is dominated by a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of liver patients.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck tried each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work underlying the sophosbyer, the active ingredient of the medicines of the Gilead company.
The United States-supported armed forces claim that the Islamic State has overtook the complete control of Manbage
The United States-supported armed forces seized full control of the northern town of Manbage next to the Turkish border, after the last remaining Islamic State militia left, informed the group on Friday.
The Syrian democratic forces (CFS) are now cleaning the city after the remaining group of militia who have been hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civil hostages held by militants from Charfan Darwish to Reuters from the Manbija Military Council Union with the FDS.
"The city is under our control now, but we're doing cleaning operations," he reported to Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax
Hillari Clinton issued its 2015 tax declarations on Friday, which showed that the candidate for Presidents from the democratic party and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received some $5.3 million in fees for presentations, and the former State Secretary announced an income of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her residency in the Department of State.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, promulgated tax declarations for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a standard of financial transparency," said the statement by the Electoral Staff Adviser, Clinton Jennifer Palmyer.
In contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false justifications and violates his past promises to promulgate his tax declarations.
This is a customary case for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although the law does not require them to do so.
The New York Businessman Trump and his lawyers referred to the State Tax Service as a reason for his refusal to publish his tax declarations.
"Your move," wrote a Twitter adviser at Clinton Jan Sams, referring to the declaration of a candidate for a democratic party.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trumpa, Michael Cohen, said to the CNN that he would not allow the Tramp to release them until the end of the checks.
Critics of the Trump, including the candidate for the Presidents of the Republican Party in 2012, said that Mitta Romney and other Republican gatherings had raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other links, including with Russia.
Clinton caught up on this issue and released an online video on Friday, which focused on the distinguished Republicans who persuaded Tempa to publish tax accountability.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during the talk on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what everyone has done without exception for the Presidents for decades: to publicize his tax declarations," she said to the congregators.
The Politico newspaper reported that the Trump had not paid any tax or almost any tax in the 1990s, and the New York Times Business Reviewer quoted many tax lawyers and accountants on Friday that might still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of a dispute in the presidential elections.
Clinton supported the rule called after a billionaire, investor Warren Buffett, which would guarantee that people receiving more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barak Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, in Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, invited Tramp to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said he was also under IRS test, and that the Trump "fears" is not a tax collection agency, but a voter.
Clinton's pre-election headquarters issued tax declarations up to 2007.
Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective total tax rate of approximately 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration for 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only for $100 of their income was the source of wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost rations index fund, and Clintons announced dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Chili powder condoms and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
In Tanzania, environmental fighters use an innovative way to prevent elephants from lying in settlements — condoms filled with powdered chiles.
The method proved effective, and Honeyguide Foundation, which came to the mind of this idea a few years ago, along with the American Committee for Nature Protection, took its step by teaching volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-stage, way to protect their homes and crops without causing harm to animals.
Earlier, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday will be World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal protection.
“From the time we have invented a set of tools..., we have seen a change in the relationship within these communities, which makes them much more confident that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without causing damage to elephants,” said Honeyguide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps are to light the torch before the broken boundary by an elephant and to signal through the horn.
If he couldn't be scared, they're throwing the so-called chili cloud.
The chili powder mixed with the soil is placed with the cotton in a condom, and its end is twisted, and only the fittle is left outside.
When the condoms are ignited, they burst into the air, spraying a small dust of powder.
One doubling is usually enough to turn the elephant to the other side.
The extreme measure is a launching device that shoots Roman candles into the air by making a loud, brilliant explosion.
To date, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey, who have left the country after an attempt to commit a state-of-law in July this year.
Such data led the Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Mellut Chawashoglu, in a conversation with local journalists.
At the first stage, we revoked 208 staff diplomats to continue their work at the centre.
Of these, 32 people have not returned without objective reasons and explanation," said the head of the Turkish foreign policy department.
Recall that a coup attempt had taken place in Turkey in July.
The authorities officially stated that the facilitator had failed and that more than six thousand persons had been detained, including high-level and medium-level military acts.
According to the Turkish Ministry of Justice, 290 people died as a result of the attempt to rehabilitate them.
The Jewish director severely criticized the Berlin Hotel for the removal of Israeli telephone code by "request" Arabs - reported the RT News Canal
The French director of Jewish origin launched a scandal in the media, discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no telephone code in Israel, with the employees referring to “requests” from Arab clients.
Claude Lanceman, author of the documentary film on the Holocaust “Shoa”, expressed his displeasure with the hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin, writing an open letter to the FAZ German media.
During his recent visit to the hotel in Lanceman, he tried to find Israel on the hotel phone code list.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the States to which it could be called directly from the room.
How could it be that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of new Germany, Israel was expelled and eradicated?
I wrote Lanceman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this issue on the stand of the hotel administration.
The answer he received, as Lanceman said, "had hurt him."
Clerk Hotel said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski hotels network."
The reason behind this step was even more angry with the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the code of Israel be removed," said Lanceman, who serves as a hotel.
Ambassador Jacob Hadas Handelsman of Israel in Germany described the case as “a terrible shame,” reports Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's really a terrible shame.
What happened in Germany and in this hotel network is even more shameful.
We don't need an explanation here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident caused a huge resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the hotel Kempinski simply "got on" with the alleged demands of Arab clients.
"Would be offended," said another post, which indicated that the hotel located on the famous street of Kurfurstendamm is next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself has hurried to remove any charges, calling the case "untending" and "spoiling" to Lanceman, reports The Der Spiegel.
“There was no direct order not to include Israel in the list of rapid recruitment,” quotes the representative of the hotel Kempinski newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian protesters
The students met the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they met to protest government reforms of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
Trouble began when the police tried to dismantle the students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their concern over the plans.
In accordance with the proposals of the Governor of the State of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 State secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some protesters were seen writing on the Graffiti walls against the Interim Acting President Michael Temer.
This last protest took place just a few days after the protesters went to the streets to support the dismissed President Dilma Rusef when the Senate of the country voted for her impression.
The trade between Russia and Iran has grown by 71% - RT Business portal reports
With the lifting of sanctions, Moscow and Tehran trade increased by 70.9 per cent over the previous year, according to Ambassador Levan Jagarian of Iran, Russia.
Since international sanctions against Iran had been lifted, there was a growing interest among Russian firms in business in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing communication with Iran and new firms are ready to gain market access.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” said Jagarian.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade between Russia and Iran had increased by 70.9 per cent over the same period in 2015 to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
Increased trade has been achieved through the supply of machine equipment, ground vehicles and weapons,” said the Ambassador.
Jagarian also predicts that Russia will visit the record number of Iranian tourists this year.
Last year the Russian diplomatic representation in Iran issued some 35,000 visas, mainly to to tourist citizens of Iran.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top-20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russia.
You can confidently say that last year's record of the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be beaten,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, which the Ambassador hopes to change.
“I personally recommend to visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yedes, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition,” he said.
The State continues to twist gays in the defence and industrial complex.
The reason for dismissal was the “systematic failure” of the genitor's assignments to the concept “Almaz-Antay”, “deprivation of work” and “loss of confidence”.
The NGO leader has been appointed Hennady Benderski for the next three years.
Information on the dismissal of Nescorodov appeared only on Thursday night and did not resonance in the media.
How can such silence be explained in a major rearming of the army?
It is likely that the management of the RF does not wish to distribute any hearings or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This reaffirms that the defence and industrial complex (JPC) has many problems and that the State does not wish to attract greater attention from society.
The removal of the Non-Scotch is certainly an important development in terms of order in the industry.
NGO Almaz is a major constituency company that specializes in the production of marine and land-based air defence complexes (MAC).
Almaz is currently working on the establishment of Polyment-Readuts and Morpheus, which is planned to be placed on new corvites, freakates, esminks and creaners.
The founder of the Navy portal, Dmitry Kornev, believes that the dismissal of Nescorodov is caused by a breakdown in the project period.
This is the most logical version.
For example, Morpheus had begun as early as 2007 and was projected to be introduced in 2013.
The Polyment-Readuts should be the main ERP system on the latest WMF ships.
According to the information I receive, in a few years no real test has been carried out.
True, as far as I can judge, there's no clear fault of Almaza in this, says Kornev.
The expert fears that a delay in entering the service may occur with the P-500 SBI.
Experienced design work on the project has not yet been completed, but the first complexes must enter the troops during 2016.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs assures that “the work is going to be planned and all will be completed within the deadlines”, although in 2014 the department recognized the problems with the development of the P-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the competencies of Nescorodov, the leader of Almaz since 2011.
The root noted that project breakdowns could be both a cause and a cause of dismissal.
In his view, it had become extremely difficult to obtain information on internal processes in the CPC and business management plans in recent years.
The industry received long-term orders for tens of billion rubles, and big money is known to love silence.
Generally, the directors of defence companies depart from their posts, under the contract of agreement of the parties, or are transferred to other work.
In the present case, the removal took place publicly, although it did not receive resonance.
It's implying that the head of Almaza was perhaps a figure of a gust and was opposed to the descending "dimension."
It seems that the State is no longer going to to accept such conduct.
By the hands of shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to dispute with Minoбороna ' s installations and fail to carry out their tasks.
At the same time, the management of the RF seeks to punish provoked managers (Machinations on Starfeers).
The President has focused on sectoral issues personally.
Vladimir Putin leads the Military Industrial Commission and meets periodically on rearming.
The Kremlin protects the JPK ' s ranks in an effort to have a loyal crew of directors who will comply with the orders received above.
This is a far-reaching policy, but there are no other instruments available to the State against the scourge of corruption and the lack of normal competition in the CPC.
The defensive situation, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical environment stimulates the Kremlin to bring order to the Armed Forces as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleaning” of managers in the CPC, the management of the RF has taken well-successful steps to enhance the professionalism of Russian troops.
Sergei Schoiga, Minister of Defence, has acquired a new quality in the army.
It seems that the President has adopted a famous saying, "Would you want peace, prepare for war."
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which established the Moscow sphere of influence on the continent.
In all the deficiencies of the bipolar system, it worked effectively.
The absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East proved to be proof of that.
The conquest of the “rewarders” in the cold war eventually resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the “civilized world”, no corner was left.
Despite the general disaster, the West refuses to speak to Russia at the level of the equal partner.
Under such conditions, the only allies of our country remain the fleet and the army.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to better uphold national interests and to reach new levels of world policy.
Scottish Kallum Skinner runs through the finish line, resulting in the capture of cycling gold by Britishs
Scottish Kallum Skinner was on his way to triumph in a man’s team sprite in Rio last night, which protected the British command trio from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgo found himself as the strongest one his friend, Scottish Sir Chris Hoy, made his own, and the young man came into history proudly, leaning on the finish line to break the victory of the Favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain had declared its right to an unexpected victory four years ago, and had won when Hoy had declared his rights to the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they retracted the trick after they had completed modestly the sixths at the March World Championship on the tracks in London, even though Hoy had finished his career since then.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jami Stoff, a specialist.
They did it just when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's exit also created the emptiness that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
The Skinner was a man who was maintained by British coaches, seeing the potential in Scotland, which was now being implemented.
Hindes, Kenny, Hoy champions four years ago, and Skinner set up the Olympic Record of Qualification, but the norm was exceeded by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
The change in strategy was a major part of the transformation where Hindes was on a larger transfer to slow down and enable Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy observed from his seat as an invited expert BBC and caught the view of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they joined the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flat comparison."
I'm here to do everything I can to make my name.
We set up the Olympic Record in the Final and won the world's champions.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After the London triumph in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes deliberately fell on the track after a failure to start.
He later renounced the commentary, and there was no way of appealing from British competitors.
There was no such question this time for the greatest victory.
Hendez said, "I felt like in London, with all the British flags on the rostrum."
We've all met like a team in the last three months.
We've been playing so many races with the world name, that the olimpiad was just awesome again.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country that won seven out of ten races in Beijing and London.
If it's a barometer of progress in the last five months, then it's going to be five more successful days.
With Kenny's form, it's not beyond the opportunity to imagine how he repeats Hoy's feat, winning three Olympic gold medals in the games.
This would help to see Kenny, who was just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (this seems to be a sacred date in British sport, which is also the birth day of Steve Redgreyva, Mo Faraha and Roger Bannister), leads to six gold medals and one silver.
It would've been like Hoy.
The next time Kenny is competing in a sprite that starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Command competitions are always the best.
You're coming to win with your comrades.
A little lonely winning one, honestly.
He said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he will have a knight."
It was the only game of medals in the day, but there were next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wingins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull are qualified for the fastest four-kilometre command race.
They were completed at 3:51,943.
The world record set at the winner of gold in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the finals (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will certainly be at the centre of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifications, when officials demanded that he be measured.
The relevant women's event, which is being resumed and concluded tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanne Roselles Schend, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavi, has improved the world record by showing time 4:13.260.
The British Command came to rely on a powerful cyclist team to own the average Olympic Games and to earn a bunch of medals.
Indeed, after exclusive demonstrations of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations were weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas on the second level, not the latest -- the departure from the position of technical director Shein Sutton in April because of the accusations of sexism and oppression, and the departure of large figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
On the basis of the first evening race, however, it seems that the legendary glory of Britain now in reaching the peaks at the right time may be repeated once again.
The future of the portland metallurgical plant threatened by the discontinuation of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland Aluminium Manufacturer in Victoria, as well as the workplaces of hundreds of workers, is threatened by the fact that the electric power company that provides the factory, according to one of the owners of the factory, is going to terminate the contract of supply: all contracts are expected to be dismantled.
This step is the result of a decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the factory.
The fixed grant for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be threatened at the Alcoa factory in Portland.
2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — may be in the risk zone as a result of any closure.
Additional indirect effects may also be as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 per cent of the electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the metallurgical factory at Point Henry, leading to the shutdown of the power plant in Engles last year.
The Portland Metallurgical Company Alcoa loses money and risks closing.
These actions have been the result of reflection on the future of the factory for several years, initially due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar and later because of the factory ' s price.
AGL, which provides a large aluminium plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Lathrob Valley, reported that it was expected that the other three owners would also take steps to break the contract.
The control share of the factory belongs to the joint short-term company of Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp have lower shares.
“AGL expects the portland object to continue to work, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop,” she said.
According to AGL, the contracts mentioned are the so-called 'heeded contracts' that were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month dissolution period, so they will actually end in 2017.
"In line with this, AGL still expects these contracts to bring their share of the income in the fiscal year 2017," said the electric power company.
Any potential influence on the profits of AGL since the financial year 2018 has now been limited to projections on the strong Führers market for whole prices of electricity.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its reporting by $187 million in terms of “the present dissolution”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to discontinue contracts “does not affect the ability of Alcoa to run a metal factory or to ensure the supply of electricity to a metal factory”.
The American company stated that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to enter into force in November this year, but it still had to explain why it had terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland Metallurgical Manufacturer in Victoria and the Tomago factory near Newcastle because of the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, the head of the AGL Operation Service, Stephen Mikelsen, said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy every year and Tomago, about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electric energy].
It will be bad for us as a producer," he said.
Not just a realistist-show star, Kendall on the cover of September Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, model and fourth daughter of the Clan Kardashian-Genner of the mother manager of Chris, appeared on the tentative September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who was the face of the brand of Estee Lauder and defilated the fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in her install in Instagram on Thursday.
"Being in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried," wrote Kandall.
The cover news was accompanied by a strange news (or just in the spirit of the Seventh of Cardashian?) prepared by a Video realist, in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the Deboshire Rob and Caitlin, also the most loved show-best uncle, the producer of the Cardashian Family, Ryan Sicrest), forgot the sister's appearance on the cover and, at the end, a classic turn: they planned a party to swellry.
It's a standard story line of almost all the episodes of children's television show dedicated to birthday.
Because with this episode dedicated to September Vogue, we certainly entered the new era of Kardashian show.
Let Kendall Kim's older sister go to Vogue's cover earlier (she and her husband, Kanye West, appear in April 2014), but September's cover is a self-sufficiency achievement.
The September issue is the most sold Vogue year.
It is more like a gift publication than a fashion magazine that attracts a large number of advertisers (on Fashionista portal, 615 pages of last year ' s 832 - page edition were advertising).
News of who the stars will fall on its cover is expected to be so eager that in the last two years the photographs of the magazine have been mergered to the official anonza.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover certainly had more “significances that work as models” than“ models that are celebrities”.
The Oscar Prize Laureate and the face of brand Dior Jennifer Lawrence were presented on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gague's honor.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, who the magazine described as the "expressive model" of his generation, falls in the first category, she's in a pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of known people, stars of realistic show or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
These are truly talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyons, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful careers in the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone's happy at Jenner's success.
The situation of Jenner in the fashion world, in view of her past TV show star, was always to be intimidated.
In June, one of the first Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour models criticized Jenner and her colleague, Jiji Hadid, who called them "the bitches of the moment."
These moods have erupted once again after Jenner's report on Vogue cover.
But it doesn't make sense to be discontented.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September Vogue.
It is a super model in all the meanings of that word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you the tone cream from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters, they're selling you their pictures in their own subscription applications.
She's selling her own photos of the LOVE magazine to Cindy Crawford.
And in the free time, maybe to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she's involved in a realist show on TV.
Public legal centres refuse to service 160,000 people per year
Every year, more than 160,000 least protected populations are denied service in public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an effect that will further reduce funding for and thus lead to limited capacity.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly older, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people who are unable to combat unfair property deprivation, and so forth — have already been denied to seek free legal assistance and representation.
Public legal services already outside the capacity are preparing for further reductions.
Since June next year, these legal centres have to lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of Public Legal Centres of Queensland, James Farrell, said that according to the latest census of the National Association of Public Legal Centres, thousands of people have been denied annually.
Farrell said that if the Federal Government's decision was not revoked, the situation would only deteriorate.
“Quinsland's public legal centres are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people are denied the essential services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relations, people with unmanageable and deplorable debts, divorced families, unfairly dismissed workers — all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot receive the assistance they need.
The Federal Government will cut funding by 30 per cent since June 2017 and thus thousands of less secure residents in Queensland will be forced to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator Quinsland, George Brandis, to cancel these reductions immediately so that people can receive the necessary assistance when faced with legal problems.
Last year, the State Government had fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the country ' s average.
Now is the time to draw attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and the time has come for the Government of Palachuk to become involved in this important work.
Donald Trump was brought to court at the election headquarters, after the staff member was allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to New York reports, Donald Trampa ' s pre-electoral headquarters was brought to court: the headquarters allegedly did nothing after the communication that his operating director in North Carolina had threatened the staff member with a gun while they were driving in the jeopardy in February.
The incident was described in a court action filed on Wednesday to a state court in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the election headquarters of the State.
Bordini said he had been waiting for several months to resolve the problem internally, but he realized that "this will not happen."
Director Earl Phillip "screwed his pistol, put his right finger on the helmet and put the doll on the Vincent knee bowl”, says Bordini in the complaint.
After appealing to the local and regional office of the electoral headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more persons had been involved in similar incidents with Phillips were alleged in the treatment.
"Pistoles don't have to shoot to do harm," said Bordini in the complaint.
The complaint took place only two days after the candidate for the Presidents of the Republican Party launched a fuor, saying to the North Carolina audience that “the people of the Second Amendment” — understood as arms owners and their amateur — could begin to act if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could choose judges.
The Trimpa pre-election headquarters said that the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not expressed support for violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demands compensation from the electoral headquarters for negligence and from Phillip for the threat of physical violence, insult and moral harm.
The representative of the Trump Hope Hicks has hesitated to respond to the request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip didn't succeed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Philip had recently left the electoral headquarters.
In response to his call to his consulting firm, the Innovative Consulting Services, no one called quickly.
The candidate for the Presidents of the Republican Party, Donald Trump, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Superior Court of Meklenburg (Sharlott).
Britain must move the Olympic spirit to the right direction and expand Hitrow.
Hitrow will also bring rebirth and prosperity not only in our local settlements and in general in London, but also throughout the country.
For me, that was the great advantage of Hethrow, as well as London 2012, where we made every effort to make our peoples and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games have greatly benefited Stratford and East End.
And we'll do that again, creating opportunities for local residents and firms next to Heitrow.
For our local settlements alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs, and end youth unemployment around the airport.
As before London 2012, there will be those who think that the expansion of Hitrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games, and that we would be in a difficult position in the world arena.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be proved wrong about Hitrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hitrow is answering any question raised about it.
Like the Olympic Games Hitrow, it is an infrastructure project for most, not just for narrow circles.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a beautiful team in Heitrow, which has implemented Pound11 billion of infrastructure investments in time and within the budget, ranging from T5, selected by the best airport terminal for five consecutive years, to T2, built in the middle of two of the world's most busy airstrips.
They are now ready to provide a third airstrip, supported by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 Olympic Games in London have been a great success for Britain, and I am confident that the expansion of Hitrow will be too.
It is time for us to turn the Olympic spirit into the right direction and to expand Hitrow by ensuring our trade future and creating the legacy of the skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton, President of the Council of Hitrou and former Trade Attaché Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing cats-macks on ad blocking
For companies that earn money on the Internet advertisement, attempting to circumvent the advertising software is a game in cats-midges, according to one of the companies that create such software.
On Thursday, literally a couple of days after Facebook announced that he was going to block ads lockers in his desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus published a blog record that users could update their filters on the program to block the advertisement in the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site would change the bulk around its ads to make it more difficult for ads lockers to recognize what parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now says he was able to pass the new code.
In his blog publication, representative Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of mutual struggle between an open source advertising community and those trying to circumvent it has continued since the invention of an advertising block," and that Facebook may present its own decision soon.
The fact that the world's largest social network has entered the fight is a clear indication of the major problem of commercial blocking.
Around the world, about 200 million people use advertising blockers, according to last year's Pagefare and Adobe study; nearly four times the number of users using such software in 2013.
Given the 1.3 billion daily active users who enter Facebook through mobile devices, mobile advertising now represents 84 per cent of Facebook’s advertising income.
However, the company is hunting advertising blockers on the desktop because mobile ads lockers are ineffective in Facebook mobile applications for the social network and the Instagram, according to the representative.
But the advertisement in the desktop is a pretty profitable article that Facebook considers it a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that he was going to update his “relamable preferences” tool to give people more control over how advertising is on them.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that the new Adblock filters were worrisome, as they would also block some non-reflectable content on the website.
"It won't be a positive experience for people, and we're planning to solve this problem," said the representative of Facebook in an official e-mail.
Advertising blockers are a rude tool, so instead we focused on building tools like advertising preferences to transfer governance to people.
A woman moved to a Swiss highway in an episode of obvious suicide
The victim was lying on a highway in the middle of the night.
The police called on witnesses after the woman had moved several vehicles on the road early in the morning on Thursday in an open attempt to commit suicide.
The incident occurred at A1 near Morge in the canton of Woon immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman was on the road in the dark with a gesture of desperation and had been hit by several vehicles, and she reported to the police in a statement.
In an attempt to kill herself, a Swiss woman at the age of 49 hit several vehicles, including a truck.
She died in place.
Some of the involved drivers have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, the police have reported that they are called upon and anyone else who has witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case, “the logical” step in this situation, stated attorney Gile Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be determined whether any of the drivers involved would be charged.
Was it possible to avoid the blow?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case — both of whom are involved in the dark road — was sentenced that motorists could not expect an accidental meeting with a pedestrian on a highway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of causing death on an unwary basis after she struck and killed a man lying at A1 near Payern in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim was drinking and losing consciousness on the road, hearing the court.
The Court found that a woman policeman — who responded to an emergency challenge — had managed the vehicle in a justified manner and that the presence of a person on the road was “perfectly exceptional and unpredictable”, said the judge.
Anyone who holds information about the incident on Thursday near Morge should call the police for 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus once lived
Venus may have ever been alive, according to NASA's new climate model estimates.
Researchers from the Nasov Institute for Space Research of Goddard developed a model for a study of the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climateologists.
The model was designed to determine whether in Venus, with its hot waterless surface and an atmosphere resuscitated by carbon dioxide, there were ever conditions like the earth.
Scientists had previously assumed that the small speed of Venus was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modelling suggests that Venus might have had a diverse atmosphere like the Earth and still have a slow rotation.
The model also reviewed the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more arid regions on the planet than on Earth, but at one time there was enough water and enough geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited the sun, which was 30 per cent thicker.
According to the GISS model, Venus' slow rotations its day-to-day side to the sun for almost two months in a single time,” explained a GISS scientist from Anthony Del Henio.
This warms the surface of the planet and produces rain that produces a thick layer of clouds that operates as a umbrella protecting the surface of the planet from a significant portion of the sun’s heat.
The result is the average climate temperature, which is surprisingly a few degrees colder than today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously envisaged by planet researchers.
Although Venus may have been alive for some billions of years, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans evaporated and her water pairs were burned with ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen flew away, only the density of the carbon dioxide with the deadly greenhouse effect remained — that is, Venus, which we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new climatic model of Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy leaves the Avalanche coach.
Patrick Roy left the coach and Vice-President of Hokque on Thursday, referring to the lack of influence during the team ' s decision-making process.
The Executive Vice-President/Chief Head of the Colorado team, Joe Sakik, confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the last three years, I have been the chief coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination,” said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I have long and diligently considered how I could improve this team to give it the depth needed and to raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and Vice-President of the Hokkey should be perfectly consistent with the vision of the organization.
It must also have the right to vote in decisions affecting the team ' s work.
These conditions have not been met for the time being.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," said Sakik.
We appreciate what he has done for our organization, and we wish it success in the future.
Roy became the winner of Jack Adams Award as the best facilitator of the League during his first season with team Avalanche in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and wins in Central Division, but Colorado was destroyed by Minnesota in the first round of play-offs and lost the play-offs in the last two years.
Avalanche announced an assessment of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and five points behind the Wild team in the struggle for the second concessional trip to the Western Conference.
A gatekeeper from the Hall of Slavs, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two from Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
The oils of the North Sea resume negotiations and suspend strikes
Work strikes on oil salaries in the North Sea have been suspended, and all the parties to the debate begin a new round of negotiations, reported by the leading representatives of the parties.
Stalling against the Wood Group oil service company was organized sporadically on platforms in the North Sea under the Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and Unions Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve current disputes”, states a joint statement.
We will hold several meetings for a full day for the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of the next week, to look at the problems with fresh views.
Trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, had been directed against potential reductions in wages up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group this year reduced the rates paid by contractual employees working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent due to the negative market tensions.
The reduction in the company ' s rates has taken place after a 10 per cent reduction in the rates for offshore contract workers in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions would provide it with the space necessary to overcome the downturn of the market.
Shell, for its part, reduced thousands of people and announced plans to end oil gas activities in the countries by up to 10, as it rationalizes its activities as a result of its mega-plier with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower price of uncleaned oil: the economic situation has deteriorated as a result of the decision to withdraw from the European Union, adopted in June by Britain.
Scotch member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labour conflicts that arose in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for most, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion for new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with the average value of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler Measures the speed of the stars in the Pleiading Stock.
The last space telescope mission, Kepler, helped astronomers to assemble the fullest catalog of the speed of the Pleiading stars.
New data helps astronomers to understand why stars in the accumulation are rotating with different speeds, as well as how the rotation periods relate to the formation of planets.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system,” explained Louise Riball, a researcher at the Centre for Infrarent Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The digging of Pleiad is 445 light years from the Earth.
Many stars in the accumulation are now only mature; they were born some 125 million years ago.
They rotate as fast as ever.
At their peak speeds, these adult stars thrust large amounts of star winds.
As they travel through the magnetic margins, the winds act as a braking force on the stars.
As the star grows older, its speed of rotation starts to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of each star by tracking the time between the detected star spots, such as the sun’s spots.
The newest catalogue of speeds suggests that more massive stars are moving slower than smaller stars.
The fisherman compares the stars to the dancers: the larger ones make the pyruettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "Balette" of Pleiad, we see that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, whereas those that move faster usually refer to very light stars," said Ribal.
Since the Pleiading is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of the stars with the speed of rotation.
"The Star Scope of the Pleiada provides a starting point for theoretical models for the rotation of stars, younger and older," said Ribelle.
We still want to know a lot about how, where and why the stars slow down their speed and hang their dance shoes for the nail, figuratively.
The Ribal and her colleagues detailed their last analysis of the speed of Pleiading in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
Inquiries related to the activities of the group of detainees in Cura by Ukrainian diversants are carried out by two agencies, writes Commersant.
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of diversifications in Crime.
As previously reported, the resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar Eugenius Panov had accepted cooperation with the investigation.
He said that he had considered the Titan chimsuol in Armenian, the petroleumbasa in Theodosia, the Kerchen ferry, the gas pipeline and one of the military airfields as objects for diversion.
The law enforcement authorities believe that not all diversant traders have been able to detain.
This, in particular, led to the arrest of suspects in the Kiev Ridge Court of Simferopol, notes the publication.
Stanislav Churches was the chief soccer coach in Russia.
At the meeting of the Executive of the Russian Soccer Union, it was decided to appoint the Chief Fellow of Russia for Stanislav Churchesov.
It will be contracted for two years before the end of the PM-2018.
On 11 August, the RFS appointed the chief trainer of Russia's assembled football for Stanislav Churchesov.
It's a famous soccer player who had previously played the Spartacy in Moscow at the gateway, and also a coach with great experience, who was the tutor of Russian teams such as the same Spartacus, Gemzcжинa Sochi, Terek, Amcar, Dinama, and the Varshawa Legia, which became the winner of national primity and cup of the country.
It is reported that the Chercosov contract will be signed as soon as possible and will be for two years.
Thus, it is his responsibility to prepare a 2018 world championship.
It is known that Miroslav Romaschenko, Gintáras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov, will enter his coach headquarters.
There is information that the salary of the entire coach headquarters will amount to Euro2.6 billion per year.
According to the media, the RFS leadership has set a target for Stanislav Churches to bring the assembly of Russia to semi-final and to win the medal.
As the coach himself stated, as a priority, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and intends to give footballers the opportunity to demonstrate himself.
Also, according to Churchesov, he's glad that he's had a choice.
The first match, led by Churches, will be held by the Russian assembly in Antalya on August 31, which will be a joint meeting with the Turkish team.
Remember, Leonid Slutzky had previously been the head coach of the Russian soccer soccer soccer faculty, combining him with training at the CSCA club.
He announced his departure from his position after the promising statement by the Russian National Team to Euro-2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the bad results of the collection.
Closed between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered severe damage during the long fight against apartheid.
However, since independence from South Africa in 1990, the country with a population of 2.4 million has made tremendous progress, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is that the Government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries are perceived to be the self-reasonable free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries, in secondary and even primary schools, education is required.
Moreover, Governments are often encouraged to introduce a fee for “reimbursement”.
In Namibia, however, primary education is free of charge.
Moreover, secondary education has also become free since 2015.
The country ' s authorities are also active in other important areas.
Malaria eradication efforts have reduced the number of annual cases of disease by 97 per cent in the last 10 years.
Contrary to the international trend of growth in inequality, Namibia is declining.
Djini, the standard income inequality rate, dropped by 15 points compared with 1993.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate declined from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than 1.90 a day) has also decreased from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest rating of freedom of speech in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The United States and other rich States were far ahead of the country.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the Corruption Index, which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that raw materials prices are falling, Namibia is able to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25 per cent, which is less than 1/3 in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
Unemployment, at least in traditional evaluation methods, remains sufficiently high, almost 28 per cent.
And like other countries in the region, the high rate of HIV/AIDS in Namibia is almost 17 per cent of the population.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is a country with income above the average, but the authorities insist that their State is actually a developing country.
Namibia is undoubtedly confronted with some of the challenges of weak economies.
The State has to develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
In the country ' s deserts, there are isolated nomadic hunter tribes that must be integrated into a modern society without losing their identity.
Integration of people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter century ago was a challenge for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: like any other country in the world, it faces the effects of climate change.
Namibia, however, did not think of letting go, the country was dealing with the problems facing it.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities engaged in the creation of a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have gathered together to work for the common good.
In fact, Namibia provides cheap medical services not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is referring to the construction of a wall that would separate the country from poor and corrupt neighbours.
Namibians realized that neighbours were not chosen, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional health projects, to encourage investments and to exchange students.
In addition, the Namibian Government had rightly judged that rich natural resources could easily be cursed, contributing to the enrichment of a few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that Namibia ' s natural wealth revenue needs to be invested in infrastructure and productive capacity.
They also realize that it would not be irresponsible to seek maximum profit from the sale of the country ' s resources and to review investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that this is so.
Transparency was crucial to this process, and the Government ' s strong support for freedom of speech was so important.
As noted by Head of State Hague Gangobe, the media often say something he does not like.
However, after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it had received, he said.
Not all key resources of Namibia are exhausted.
Some, such as fisheries, are renewable, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings — racism, colonialism, inequalities and underdevelopment — can lead to common prosperity.
Its achievement deserved international recognition and imitation.
Many heard of the Gold of Warna, the oldest golden objects created by man (4600 - 4200 B.C.E.).
It was probably the strongest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, in the excavation of the Varenne Necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts was found, more than 3,000 total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only one burial known as “Kogel No. 43” was recovered from 990 gold items with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the oldest gold world can soon turn to a archaeologist’s archaeological bush in July.
Again, in Bulgaria, the pre-historical settlement known as Tel Unacitus.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tel Yunaccié is located far from the sea, near the village of Unacitu of the Pazarjik region.
The bush is a golden strip thrown into the ring.
Javor Boyajiev, director of the site in Tella Unacitus, dated 4600 before our Common Era and stated that she was older than the gold of Varna for at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna are, in fact, about the same period, from 4600 to 4200 before our Common Era.
There are no technologies to date metal with accurate dates.
How, then, can we be sure of what gold is more ancient?
Obviously, Professor Bojajiev knows more than he told Reuters, "I'm absolutely sure that the gold of Unaccié is older than the gold of Varna."
This is an incredibly important discovery: it is a small subject, but it is large enough to take a suitable place in history.
In an interview, Reuters Boyajiev reported that scientists would soon analyse the composition of the metal, as well as review the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found, repeatedly and more thoroughly.
This will help to date the boss with as accurate as possible.
The place of discovery also explains much.
Tel Unacciety is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Tel Yunaccié is now considered the oldest “city” of Europe.
Tel was founded by the descendants of the people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium before our Common Era.
The processing of metals in the region has evolved turbulently over the centuries, ranging from the first metallurgical skills to the establishment of a fully developed industry.
In the domestic history of this archaeological community, there is a special name: the Balkano-Karpat Metallurgical Province.
In the five millennium before our age, the metal processing centers began to form urban settlements.
They are now known as the ancient cities of Europe.
Of these, Tel Yunaccié may have been the oldest, since artifacts 4,900 before our Common Era were found here.
I would call Tel Junacieta a prototype of a modern city, although it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This place is over Shumer for a thousand years," says Boyajiev, in view of the generally accepted view that urban culture was born in southern Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.
The first cities were created in the usual understanding of that word.
The telescopes of Unaciete have been in place since 1976.
During that time, archaeologists dug almost 12 hectares, about one third of the projected total settlement area.
Residues of the ceiling wall were found, which at one time reached three metres high.
Although little remained from houses and workshops, archaeologists clearly distinguished streets, public buildings, urban dense buildings, business centers and residential areas.
Tel Junaciete is often called "A Bird City," where dozens of clay bird figures have been found.
All birds are pictured in a state of rest, and it is assumed that they were not decorative objects but the object of local worship.
The Bird City was destroyed about 4100 B.C.E. - maybe by the Indo-European tribes coming from the north-east.
The nomads had no cities, but there were horses and weapons.
The three-foot walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found clear signs of brutal slaughter: the remains of old men, women and children have been found inside the houses, bearing traces of wounds inflicted by warring axes.
New discoveries and new facts appear annually, changing the usual ideas about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking, not of individual cultures, but of the “lost ” first civilization of Europe in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive in the search for this civilization was the gold of Varna, found relatively recently in 1972.
It's logical that Varna's gold luxury was supposed to be preceded by something like a tiny golden bush created in the Telle of Unacitus.
In Porsche, the 911 Targa model was artificially older.
It has been officially stated that 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is conducted by the manual specialists of the unit working with serial machines.
Retro-hucus is, for example, in the special color of Etna Blue body, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, even the model logo is painted in this color.
In addition, the guara has received a firm white graph along the boards and special 20-inch Wheeled RS Spyder disks, as well as some parts of the design of the body in white metal.
In the interior of retro-writes, it is markedly smaller: it is largely different from the sero-sharing gamma, new chairs with extended electrical regulatory ranges and the black, anodized steel thresholds with logo of the unit.
In addition, when purchased with a special version, each buyer will receive a chechole gift for the car and a richly separated album with photographs of the production process.
The strength of Porsche Exclusive experts did not come to touch: the retro-treasure on the characteristics is exactly the same as the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder motor with a turbonadium of 3.0 litres developing 420 litres and 500 Nm.
The dynamic 911 Targa 4S is capable of speeding up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released with a limited circulation, but neither its volume nor the value of each particular sportsman is reported.
Facebook and advertising blockers unleashed an arms race
The recent introduction of Facebook technology that prevented the concealment of advertising on social media pages has prompted decision makers to block advertising for retaliation.
At AdBlock Plus, they released the Opposition, but Facebook is planning to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus predicted its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
Societies noted that in trying to deceive the new technology of unlocked advertising, the decision from AdBlock Plus, together with commercial announcements, blocks many regular posts from friends or pages.
In Facebook, they regretted this AdBlock Plus policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to the source among the Societies of TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook dessktop website will be ready for the next hours.
Societies and blockers have thus unleashed a kind of “arms race” by trying to beat each other, but the affected party has become users who have missed interesting notes from friends or who have seen advertising where they are not used to see it.
The ethical aspects of advertising blocking have recently caused hot disputes.
In Murmansk, the rapist will be brought to court in the evening Murmansk.
His case had already been completed in the Russian Federation Investigation Committee on the Murman Field.
The indictment for a 54-year-old man is very serious - sexual violence.
It has been determined that, at the end of November 2015, the accused in the area of Paul's Street in Murmansk committed sexual acts of violence against a 20-year-old girl. The criminal case with the approved indictment is sent for substantive consideration.
The authorization of the article provides for a maximum penalty of up to six years ' imprisonment.
Dongfeng will bring Krosswen Fengguang 370 to Russia and pickup Rich New - Web site www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a popular representative of a class of cars in China, combining the merits of the minivan and crossover.
Another stated Russian premiere is Pickap Rich New.
Many Western firms of the Moscow International Automobile decided to ignore this year, so the emptiness of the Expo Expo exhibits would be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, a strong front will be the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has large types on the Russian market and intends to offer some interesting news to our road lovers in the near future.
One of them will be Krosswen Dongfeng Fengguang, 370 who sold in China this spring price of 55,900 Yuan (less than 550,000 roubles at current rate).
The Russians are unlikely to have such a value, and the question of delivery to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang, 370 of the June sales were able to reach the 11th place on the list of the most sold minivans, although, in view of the high road light (175 mm) and the protective plastic cover of the lower perimeter of the body, it can be attributed to crossovers.
Krossven is built on a Fengguang 360 forer-floor platform, 370 for the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is stronger and the equipment is richer.
The salon is painted with wooden jars, but the large vertical sensor display, "as at Tesla's central convoy" is only on the early exhibition copies of Krswen, and the cars with the "music" are easy to sell.
Five of the seven landing places are easily folded, forming a 1650 mm loading area, the maximum volume of the trunk is 1,500 litres.
The engine for Fengguang 370 provides only one - 1.5-litre gasoline "atmospheric" power 115 litres, compatible with a 5-inch mechanical gearbox.
The manufacturer modestly specifies the dynamic quality of the machine, but promises that the owner's savings budget will be 6.7 l/100 km.
Picap Rich New is a well-known Russians Nissan NP 300 Navara of the past generation, but with a slightly frozen Chinese styleist design.
Despite the morally obsolete design, the model still enjoys a stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a robust and unwilling “work horse”.
At a similar price, Rich New is likely to be interested by the Russians, because the modern Japanese peaks have become too expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two elective engines: petrol 2.4 litres (137 litres) or turbodizele 2.5 litres (116 litres).
The gearbox is only a mechanic, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a rigid "front".
At the Dongfeng stand and the new flagship Sedan A9, his Russian Prime Office of the Chinese firm announced in June.
Minvena-like cross-verbs in the Chinese market are becoming more and more, one of the latest news is Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
The Russian linen Dongfeng currently consists of two models: S30 and Hatchbek H30 Cross.
Within seven months of this year, the Chinese firm’s dealers carried 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notifications will cease to be sent by mail - www.zr.ru Web site
The Tax Inspectorate has changed the dispatch of property tax notifications.
All Russian car owners have been used to a scheme that has not changed for years: in the summer and autumn, they receive a receipt by mail for a previous year ' s transport tax.
However, many will not wait this year.
The fact is that the tax inspection has changed the notification order of citizens.
Those who are registered at the Personal Tax Payer Cabinet on the official website of the agency nalog.ru will receive notice in electronic form.
In the inspection, they automatically considered these Russians as online users and cut them off from standard, paper.
The novelty affects all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All others will continue to receive regular letters.
On the other hand, the possibility of returning to the old scheme is also available to the account holders on the website.
In order to do so, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notice will appear in the "Privacy Cabinet" immediately after writing, while the letter will go a few days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of users of the online tax inspection services has been overturned for 18 million people, allowing the department to save seriously on mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly not sufficient to inform citizens of the changing order.
Some could register in the "Private Cabinet" for one-time service and have forgotten it for a long time.
These people will not wait for e-mail notifications, and they will fall into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to "Link Tax Payer Cabinet" is done in three ways: through the portal recording of gosuslugi.ru, by electronic signature or by entering the log and password specified in the registration map.
The latter can be obtained in person in any tax inspection office (dependent on the location of the accounting position).
We recall that this year the transport tax must be paid until 1 December.
The sending of notifications started in July.
The Tuning Mercedes-Benz G class, where refinements are designed to achieve very high returns, is something in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the masters of G-Power who had begun to modify Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing to human masters is strange.
In fact, why not improve G 63-571 aerodynamic carbon and aerodynamic tank to a hundred for 5.4 s?
The craftsman's ridiculous "helics" was using the advantages of opening a 5.5-litre overhead eight.
And then the breakdown dynamic has improved to a hundred to the indifferent 0.1 s, and now the flying Kyrpich is capable of ripping for 5.3 s.
On the other hand, acceleration from medium speeds is certainly better for it.
The speed ceiling intimidates: if standard G 63 is not travelling faster than 210 km/h, the tuning all-road with the deactivated electronic “wheel” can drain 250 km/h.
Outside the vehicle is practically incompatible with its factory source, with the exception of other wheel discs - the 23-inch Hurricane RR dimension of 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach Lux Unit announced an amazing conceptual bunch of 6 m long, which will be presented in the context of the Pebble Beach Conference of Elegance.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the BMW i green sub-brand and will move its electrical models under a separate trade mark.
In the coming years, at least four environmental innovations are expected.
