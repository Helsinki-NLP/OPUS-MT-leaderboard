Welsh MPs worry they'll be confused by the "muppets"
Some Members expressed concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern arose in connection with plans to change the name of the Parliament of Wales assembly.
Members across the political spectrum are concerned that this will sound ridiculous.
A Labour MP said his party is concerned that "it will rhyme with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, the word "twp" means "stupid" and the word "pwp" means "feces".
A Plaid MP said the faction overall was "unsatisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative stated that his own faction was "open-minded" about changing the name, but noted that the word MWP is not far from the word "mapet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to Yorkshire's English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently drafting the bill to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any name by which Members will be called will of course be a matter for Members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Parliament of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted for naming the Parliament as the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of Members, the Commission was in favour of the designation 'Member of the Parliament of Wales' or WMP, but it is the MWP option that received more support during the public consultation.
MPs are apparently proposing alternatives, but trying to reach a consensus can be a difficult case for the Speaker of Parliament, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill to change the name within the next few weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes in the way parliament operates, including rules of deduction from the office of MP and the design of the committee system.
Members will decide in the final vote on the question of their name when discussing legislation.
Macedonian citizens come to the polls for referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote Sunday on changing the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The people's vote was called for in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that its northern neighbour's name hides territorial aspirations and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership demands.
Gjorge Ivanov, the president of Macedonia, an opponent of the referendum on changing the name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change is simply the price they have to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells have been silenced as churches in Harlem disappear
"The older people I talked to, they say there used to be a bar and a church in every corner," Mr Adams said.
Today, there is neither."
He said he understands why the bars disappeared.
"The world is socializing in a different way today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the 'salon' of the neighborhood where people hang out regularly."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the assets will not last as long as the officials hope "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
The churches, he added, may be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who will not be willing to help the places of worship left in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore expedite the day when all these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that all these people who will move into these apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan community was built in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took possession of the building.
The possession of St. Martin's building was taken over by a congregation of blacks under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who proceeded to boycott 125th Street stores, a key shopping street in Harlem, which refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused severe damage to the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners undertook the reconstruction and ordered the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it a different one: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable instrument of historical importance".
The expert, Tiffany In from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was transferred to a larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's church did not replace him.
What has been happening in recent months to St. Martin is a complex story between architects and contractors, some of whom were hired by the church's lay leaders, while others by the diocese.
The commissioners - the administrative body of the parish, made up of the popular leaders - sent the diocese in July a letter about their concerns that the diocese "would seek to shift the cost" to the diocese of commissioners, despite the fact that this had no involvement in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the church.
Some parishioners complained about the diocese's lack of transparency.
Shark attack on 13-year-old in lobster dive in California
Shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during lobster fishing dives in California, the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in the town of Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the cries of the child asking for help and approached rowing with a group to get it out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought they were just screams of excitement because he caught lobster, but then he realized he was yelling "Something bit me!
Something bit me!"
His entire clavicle had been opened," Hamel remarked when he arrived at the boy's place.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the sea!'" Hamel added.
The boy was flown to Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical.
The type of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Lifeguard Larry Giles said in the press release that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was thought not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim carries severe injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities banned access to the beach from Biss Point in Cassabland to Swamis in Encinitas for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's designs are putting pressure on the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by placing cosmetic shelves corresponding to those of department stores, staffed with special employees.
As part of the significant rise in the UK cosmetics market of Î”2.8 billion, which is still growing while sales of clothing and household items are falling, larger cosmetics shelves will be put on trial at 11 stores across the country and spread to more stores if the venture succeeds.
The investment in the cosmetics sector comes as supermarkets look for a way to replenish the shelf space that once occupied televisions, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's said they would double the size of their cosmetics supply to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more shelf space with the company logo, similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is relaunching its own line of boutique makeup so that most products are vegan - something younger consumers are increasingly asking for.
In addition, perfume company The Fragrance Shop will try to sell its products in two Sainsbury's stores, one opened in Croydon, South London, last week and the other in Shelly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy small amounts of food daily in local mini markets, means that supermarkets should make greater efforts to get people to visit them.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that outlet stores will increasingly look like department stores, as supermarket chains try to compete with Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more out-of-food services.
Sainsbury's put outlet Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced some Habitat as they bought both chains two years ago, which supported grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renovate its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to allocate profits from pharmacy stores to the chain's supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for $125 million, three years ago.
He stated that Lloyds would play its own role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury care companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our shelves in order to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of companies is designed to meet every need, while the attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a strong destination for cosmetics which questions the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones: furious after Holly Willoughby pulls out of 11-million-dollar deal
Dragons Den series star Peter Jones is furious after TV host Holly Willoughby leaves her 11 million-dollar deal with her lifestyle business in order to devote herself to her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for the clothing and accessories company Truly.
Their business was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop company.
The 37-year-old host of the show "This Morning", announced on Instagram her decision to leave.
Holly Willoughby made the series' protagonist Dragons Den, Peter Jones, furious by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute, in order to devote herself to her new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became furious when the golden TV girl admitted during a meeting full of tensions Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that due to her new contracts - worth $1.5 million - she would no longer have enough time to spare the clothing and accessories company Truely.
The company was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop company and appears to have doubled Willoughby's fortune estimated to be $11 million.
Following 37-year-old Willoughby's announcement on Instagram that she is about to leave Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his country houses.
According to one source: "Truly was far from Holly Willoughby's top priorities.
It was its long-term future, its source of revenue for decades to come.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone involved in the operation.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There is a warehouse full of products at the headquarters in Marlowe ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the departure of the show's host "This Morning", which is among Britain's most commercial celebrities, could cost the company millions due to the huge investment in products from pillows and candles to household clothing and clothing, as well as further delay in its presentation.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have maintained close friendships with Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with the Cup in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
Couples spend their vacation together and Jones maintains a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the central figure in M&S campaigns and replace Ant McPartlin in the presentation of the show "I'm A Celebrity" on ITV.
A source from Jones's close environment said last night "We wouldn't want to comment on his professional affairs."
We were tough "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for a comment that some would consider inappropriate to a president, as well as his so positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said imitating the TV host style.
"I didn't concede anything".
He stated that Kim is interested in a second meeting, after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, top North Korean diplomat Rye Yong-ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see any "corresponding response" from the US after North Korea's untimely disarmament.
Instead, he stressed, the US continues to apply sanctions aimed at putting pressure on them.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
"We are doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We almost made war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have built this extraordinary relationship."
He stated that his efforts to improve relations with Kim yielded positive results - an end to missile testing, release of hostages, and return of the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
While supporting his unusual stance on statements about his relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to have 'presidential' style, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the hall because they couldn't get in, we would have only 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia sweep an entire island, leaving thousands dead in their wake
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was announced that foreign non-governmental organizations would not need assistance.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, a necessary condition for the utilization of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they are not asking for international aid, it is therefore quite difficult," said Ms. Shubung.
While Save the Children is preparing a group to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign staff will be able to work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national natural disasters agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to contribute aid.
Given the seismic tremors that often strike Indonesia, the country remains dismally unprepared against the rage of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Ache, the same is not the case on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami alert siren in Palu, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
At best, moving between Indonesia's numerous islands is difficult.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A floating hospital stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo was at the centre of his election campaign improving Indonesia's disorganized infrastructure and generously allocated money for the construction of roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding plagues Mr. Joco's administration, before re-election the following year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from the persisting fanatical tendencies in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as groups of Christians and Muslims battle in the streets, using knives, bows and arrows, as well as other improvised weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturge equals against Chelsea
Daniel Sturge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League against Chelsea by goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Steritz received a pass from Serdan Shakiri about 27 meters away from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball on his left and shot on the back beam.
His effort was driven very high from the large area and ended up at the top right in the nets.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arizabalaga who jumped to fend it off and got into the net.
"I was trying to take that position, get to the ball and players like Shakiri always play as far forward as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Steritz told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw KadÃ© approaching, I made a direct switch, I didn't think about it much and I made the shot."
Chelsea had the lead 1-0 in the half after the goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Edin Azhar.
The blue quarterback passed the heel to Mateo Kovacic in this game, before giving a shot with a falcon near the center of the field and running on the Liverpool side.
Kovacic made one two in the center of the field.
He then gave a deep ball, leading Azhar to the large area.
Azhar ran ahead of the defender and completed by sending the ball into the nets on the rear beam with a left shot in front of Liverpool's Allison Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3 p.m. Thursday in London.
The tragic death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia stands at 832
The death toll after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia stands at 832, according to the country's natural disasters agency statements, early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the wreckage of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit the area on Friday and created waves 6 meters high, said agency spokesman Sutopo Puruo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old suspect after murdering a woman with a knife
A murder investigation began after the discovery of the body of a woman in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Muse on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked the residents who saw or heard something to testify to the police .
Officer Brine Ohaigan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I would like to appeal to anyone who was in the neighboring area around John Street and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashcam footage to contact us as they may be in possession of information that is vital to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a building.
This afternoon friends who believe they may know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway as police said they are in the process of informing the nearest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse, in his attempt to return to his apartment was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
Residents were informed that it may take hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
One police officer reportedly told a man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene.
He kept repeating "it's horrible."
At 2 p.m. two police vans were located through the police ribbon and one off.
Police officers stood outside the ribbon and watched the apartment building.
Anyone with any information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers line anonymously at 0800 555 111 for case 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the last monument to be struck by the brawl over "rewriting history"
His ostracism would be poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of numerous cultural and religious works of England by his fanatic puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Association described Mr. Creek's proposal as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: "In this debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster Palace was not targeted.
The iconoclasm of England's civil wars was not dictated or executed by Cromwell.
Possibly, a wrong member of the Cromwell family was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas' ancestor in the previous century.
Cromwell's outstanding representation by Sir William Hammo Thornicroft is typical of his 19th-century image and part of the historiography of a personality that many believe to be worthy of tribute.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a perfectly accurate case is the subject of an open historical debate.
All that is certain is that the conflicts in the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation and Cromwell is a recognizable personality representing one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also commendable and memorable."
Pig-killer Injures Deadly Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in Southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, only known by the surname "Wan", was found with a severed artery inside a blood pool near a pigsty at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, South China announced the Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig room employee is preparing to give vaccines to pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Kinhai province, China.
He reportedly had traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door of a neighboring pighouse open.
He stated that in the pigsty there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
The coroner's examination confirmed that the pig weighing 227 kg had fatally injured the farmer, according to his report.
"My cousin's feet were bloodied and mounded," said the cousin, known by his surname "Woo", according to the Guiyang evening news report.
Security camera footage shows Wan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Wan or his cousin.
A market official told the evening newscast that the pig has been placed in a cage so as not to attack anyone else, while police collected the evidence at the scene of the attack.
Wan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating some compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of swine attacks on humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 295-pound pig threw a farmer in Wales on his tractor until the farmer's wife frightened the animal away.
After the incident in which an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs normally are not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as "a trigger".
"They're just in a playful mood.
They're small, very strange creatures... they don't want to hurt.
We should just show them proper respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are set to bring widespread rainfall to the Southwest U.S.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the coldest water masses on Mexico's northern coast.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring cataclysmic rainfall to Northern Mexico and the Southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa's wind power reached 85 mph, becoming a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. Eastern time, on Sunday and was detected 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an area of low wind pressure has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastwards to the US West Coast. As Hurricane Rosa approaches the Lower California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will bring tropical humidity northwards to the Southwestern US.
Hurricane Rosa will bring rainfall of 25 cm in areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical humidity combined with the area of low wind pressures approaching will create widespread heavy rainfall in the Southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 cm high rains will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates approaching 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour locally, especially in parts of Southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rains 5 to 10 cm high are expected locally in the Southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapid deterioration of the phenomena due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is recommended to avoid any movement on foot in the desert in view of the threat of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rainfall can turn the canyons into rushing rivers and storms will cause local heavy winds and sandblasting.
The low-wind pressure area will generate some locally strong rainfall locally on the Southern California coastline.
Total rainfall of more than 1 centimeter is likely, which can cause small debris flows and slipperyness on the roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the area.
Some scattered tropical bores will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early morning hours on Monday, before the phenomena expand late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread to the For Corners area on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October some intense temperature changes will be seen throughout the US as temperatures in the Arctic fall, but in the tropical zones remain quite high.
Sometimes, this leads to very intense temperature changes at short distances.
A typical example of the intense temperature differences between the central U.S. was observed on Sunday.
There was a difference of almost 10 points between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent high summer temperatures will be observed and spread again.
In much of the Central and Eastern U.S., October is expected to begin with high temperatures at 27 Â°C from the Eastern Plains to portions in the Southeast.
The temperature in New York City can reach 27 Â°C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above average.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a good chance of temperatures above the average in the Eastern U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers attended Brett Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million viewers watched the riveting testimony of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh on Thursday and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blazey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with television networks disrupting the program's normal last-minute rollover flow on Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake's agreement to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent certain that at a party while they were high school students Cavanaugh attacked her while he was drunk and attempted to take off her clothes.
Cavanaugh, in a charged statement, stated that he is 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen's measurements, it is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers attended the hearing on Friday.
The company estimated average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC networks.
The numbers did not immediately become available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
While also, Nielsen usually has difficulty calculating the number of viewers watching a broadcast from office spaces.
To look at this ratings in its correct dimensions, it's an audience of similar size to the one watching a playoff football game or the Academy Award ceremony.
Fox News, whose journalists strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
In second place, is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
They followed CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake emerged as the lead in Friday's drama.
Following the Republican moderate's statement that he would vote in favor of Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning protesters disapproving him as he was trying to get into the elevator for the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood staring down for several minutes as he was frowned upon, live on television on CNN.
"I stand here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He said to him, "you have authority when so many women are powerless."
Flake stated that his office had made statements and, before the elevator doors closed, that he would have more to say at the Commission hearing.
All cable television and transmission networks covered live a few hours later, the Senate Justice Committee vote on promoting Cavanaugh's nomination to the Senate plenary for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate next week, which was requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partly convinced after discussions with his friend, Democratic Party Senator Chris Coons.
After discussions with Kuns and some other Senators thereafter, Flake ruled.
Flake's choice was valid, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not gather the votes for Cavanaugh's approval without conducting an investigation.
President Trump has called for an investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson has been harshly critical of the Chequers Brexit plan, saying the proposal to collect tariffs between Britain and the EU was "totally absurd".
Wade Simms shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU player's murder
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old LSU basketball team player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and held in prison on a second-degree murder charge, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have a video of Simms's fight with Simpson in their hands and according to police Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police officers located the glasses at the crime scene and said they detected traces of Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB who works with CBS.
Following Simpson's interrogation, police said they admitted to fatally wounding Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report of East Baton Rouge coroner released on Friday, the cause of death is a bullet wound to the head and neck.
The Ministry made available to the Louisiana Police a task force, the police forensic lab, the South University police forces and the citizens of the area for assistance in the investigation into the arrest.
LSU sports director Joey Alleve thanked local law enforcement for the "intensive investigation and pursuit of justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre-high forward raised Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach Owl Owayde said the team is "crushed" and "in shock" since Wade's death.
"We're always concerned about incidents like this," Oweed said.
Volcanic ash emissions in Mexico City
Volcanic ash emissions from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexican residents on Sunday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater reached its peak, with 183 emissions of gases and ash recorded over 24 hours.
The Center monitored various readings and minor seismic vibrations.
Images on social media show car windshields covered with thin layers of ash in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Socimilco.
Geophysicists observed an increase in volcano activity located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake occurred in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police forces clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a clash of pro-independence protesters with the classroom rehabilitation units, as thousands participated in the protests for the first anniversary of the vote to secede Catalonia that caused polarization.
A group of pro-independence masked protesters, held back by the class rehabilitation units, launched eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually overrun by tourists.
Clashes also occurred later in the day with police officers using their batons to suppress the clashes.
For hours groups of supporters of Catalonia's independence chanted the slogan "We don't forgive, we don't forget" against groups of protestors in favor of the unity of the country who chanted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated with minor injuries that occurred during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain high in the independence-supporting region a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid, which is nevertheless celebrated by the separatist Catalans.
The vast majority of voters opted for independence, although turnout was low with those opposed to independence boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the area where violent clashes occurred.
Pro-independence groups camped late Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but was forced to take a different turn.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician involved in the pro-independence protests with his wife, said he no longer had any hopes for Catalonia's prospects of gaining independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our brightest moments.
I saw my parents with tears of joy that they managed to vote, but now the situation is stagnant," he said.
Despite having scored a vital victory though limited in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties struggled to maintain their momentum this year, with many of their best-known leaders having self-exiled or in custody pending trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Pooch, a 42-year-old engineer, who recorded the pro-police protests on his cell phone, said the clashes were fueled by politicians from both camps.
"The tension is escalating more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Zuneckeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who were detained last year, announced his candidacy in the European elections for next year.
"My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to denounce the suppression of democratic values and the oppression we have received from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londoderi: Man arrested after car crash in residence
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a repeated car crash at a residence in Londoderi.
The incident unfolded at Bolinagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
There may have been a shooting in the car at some point.
Menga's hit gave Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers by giving Steven Gerard just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox group.
Dolly Menga's hit made a difference as Gary Holt's side switched to Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team remains without a home win in the league this season and faces the Harts, who have the lead with eight points, next Sunday.
Before this match, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston meanwhile continues her undefeated race in six games in her league, with main coach Holt not yet experiencing any defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities with visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before scoring, with its immediacy embarrassing the Rangers.
Scott Robinson took a lead and nearly made it to the finish, but Alan Lithgow repulsed his attempt by sliding Craig Halket's header away from the finish.
The hosts willingly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could strain visitors into free kicks and cornering.
And that's how the important goal came about.
The Rangers were unable to prevent a free kick and Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to send the ball to Menga, who took the pass and scored from the center of the area.
By that point, the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball but found the home team's defense impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This figure continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos repelled the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was repelled from Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's legs and Lithgow's pass was knocked out in another free kick by Livingston.
There were many vertical passes made in the Livingston area and they were constantly rebuffed, while two penalty kicks were requested - after a claim to the ball by Halket against substitute player Glenn Middleton and one for hand - which were rejected.
"Excellent Game" by Livingston - analysis
Alastair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Spectacular performance and results for Livingston.
All of them, without exception, were excellent, exceeding expectations in this upward course.
Their style of play and personality changed little after returning to top form, but credit should also be given to Holt for the boost he gave the team upon his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Chief Halkett was excellent, enlisting a highly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joey Warrell on the alert throughout the game.
Rangers, on the contrary, had no inspiration.
As good as they have been in the past under Gerard's guidance, they have not met these standards.
Their last game was incomplete - only once they managed to pass the home team defenses and this is a warning bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the rankings.
Mixed feelings at Erdogan's reception in Cologne
The climate was good on Saturday (September 29th) at the meeting of the heads of state of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to restore relations with NATO allies.
They had broken with regard to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest community of Turks outside Turkey.
Police blocked the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters were able to approach to see their president in person.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them of Kurdish origin - also gave the present, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The split of protesters reflects the controversial nature of a visitor treated by some Turkish-Germans as a hero and by others as a dictator.
Car accident in Detfort: death of cyclist after car crash
A cyclist lost his life in a car collision in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Detfort, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and ambulance rescuers tried to help, but the man lost his life on the spot.
The collision occurred a few months after a similar incident where a driver hit and abandoned a cyclist, who lost his life on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said authorities are making efforts to identify the man and inform their nearest relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been diverted, and drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prisons: Six Police Officers Injured in Clashes Â· Global Voices
Six police officers were injured in rioting that broke out in the prisons of men of maximum security, according to prison management statements.
Riots broke out at His Majesty Long Lartin's prison in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special police forces "Tornado" have been recruited to deal with the riots, involving eight prisoners and which manifested themselves in one wing.
Police officers were treated with minor facial injuries during the clashes.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained personnel took over to deal with the incident in His Majesty Long Lartin's prisons.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate the violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police authorities and may serve a longer sentence."
In His Majesty's prison Long Lartin more than 500 prisoners are being held, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June the prison administrator was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year the class rehabilitation units in prison were called in to suppress serious incidents that broke out, during which staff members were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (dried areas may benefit)
It is rare for a tropical recession to hit Arizona, but this is exactly what is likely to happen early next week, as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cross the southwest parts of the desert, bringing flooding to their passage.
The National Weather Service has already issued emergency flood warning bulletins for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will arrive late Monday in rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have remained in a tropical storm or low barometric state less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the U.S. National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 2 to 4 inches high, with individual volumes of rain up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other areas of the Southwestern States, including the Central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, rainfalls of 1 to 2 inches are likely to occur, with the possibility of individual total volumes of rain up to 4 inches.
For areas not at risk of flooding, the rain Rosa brings may be a blessing, as the area is plagued by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, part of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the Southwestern States are currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Observatory, more than 40 percent of Arizona faces at least extreme drought, which is the second highest drought category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will reach land on the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Maintaining the intensity of the hurricane, on Sunday morning Rosa will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour and will be moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore weaken.
It is therefore expected to reach land in Mexico with tropical storm intensity in the afternoon or Monday night.
Heavy rainfall may occur in areas of Mexico, which will cause a significant flood risk.
"Total rainfall volumes of between 3 and 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, which are likely to reach as high as 10 inches," according to weather.com.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm now and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low barometric, which will then pass through Arizona to reach southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main risk expected from Hurricane Rosa or its remains is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the US Southwest," said the U.S. National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous heavy floods and torrents of mud in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous lands.
Minchomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted homicide
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempted homicide after a 16-year-old man was identified who brought knife wounds to Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Beast area of Minchomer Norton, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police officers are appealing for anyone who may have recorded on video on their mobile phone what happened.
Trump states that Kavanaugh "lived the badness and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favor of Judge Cavanaugh is a vote to reject the merciless and infuriating tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "lived the badness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Cavanaugh testified to Congress Thursday, categorically and with apparent emotion denying Christine Blazey Ford's allegations that she was sexually assaulted decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified before an audience about her allegations.
The President said on Saturday that the "American people saw Cavanaugh's greatness, quality and courage" that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Cavanaugh's candidacy is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a jurist with an excellent public service course," he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Cavanaugh's candidacy, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but actually it's like I am," he said.
"That's why I travel everywhere supporting excellent candidates."
Trump said Democrats are on a "resistance and obstruction" mission.
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Cavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior aide to the Republican Party leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and total number of victims predicted to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were swept away by the giant waves that swept the coast, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island, authorities said Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palos on Friday, when waves six meters high hit land at dusk, drawing many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of 7.5 Richter.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately, so it was hit by it," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster response agency, said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it swept away cars, wood, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled to the ocean at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were taken to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photos published by the disaster response agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, bridges that have been twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to strike the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
He said heaps of victims were found trapped beneath the wreckage of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be greater along the 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication systems were "completely paralysed and there is no information" from Dongala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading towards the areas affected.
"This is already a tragedy and it can get even worse," he said.
Wide-ranging criticism was brought to the Agency on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had struck Palu, even though according to officials the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building is heard shouting panicked trying to warn people down on the way to the tsunami coming up.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, drifting homes and cars.
The Reuters agency was unable to immediately ascertain the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which also disrupted communications in the wider Palu area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but displaced people still desperately need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was reopened only to contribute to relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The victims of the tsunami in Indonesia exceed 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Dongala managed to arrive safely in the city of Palu, where workers took refuge in tarpaulin accommodations set up in the courtyard of their office, they went through scenes of destruction along the way, Mr. DossÃ©ba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some relief groups took on the sad task of starting the relief process for those affected, some complain that foreign, highly experienced relief workers were not allowed to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesia's regulations, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin if the site of a disaster is declared a zone of national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says this is a national disaster, we can make a request for international assistance, but there is no decision yet."
As the second day in Palu passed after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and family of those still missing still hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the history of these natural disasters less bleak.
On Saturday, a little boy was recovered from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days, next to her mother's dead body.
Genton Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Madaji, were his students.
"As an older man in the sport of paragliding, I have my own emotional load," he said.
Mr. Genton recounted how, when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paratroopers' community was released, he began sending desperate WhatsApp messages to his opponents in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, the indication next to his messages was a gray "n" symbol, instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves earned $26,750 when refueling an auto-deposit machine in Newport on the Levi.
On Friday morning, thieves obtained $26,750 from a Brink employee who was refueling an ATM machine in Newport on Leavi, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had evacuated an ATM machine to the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, police officer Dennis McCarthy said in the announcement.
While busy, another man "came running after the Brink employee" and stole a bag of money meant for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects leave the scene, according to the announcement, but police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport police, calling 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
rapper Kanye West changes his name to Son.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has long been listening to the pampering Ye and used this nickname as the title on his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change preceded his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album called Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her appearance for "emotional reasons", as the show's creator reported.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the professional name he uses today, West had previously stated that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you,'" West had previously stated this year, in a discussion about the title of his album with radio producer Big Boy.
So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
My name changes from Kanye, which means "the one," to Ye, which is just a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused of ourselves, of everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Shin Cobbs is known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Didi or Didi, but announced this year that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West partner, JER-ZI, is also satisfied with using his name with or without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's President-Elect Swears He Won't Use Army Against Civilians Â· Global Voices
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed that he would never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody student crackdown.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the army to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were gaining roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal gangs.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in this field, states investor and artificial intelligence professional Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment comes in addition to announcements by various parts of the U.S. government about artificial intelligence, as the U.S. does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence overall.
Meanwhile, China last year presented its plan to become the world's first country in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Duplicating the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries fall so far short of the US and we seek to make the next major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book titled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The superpowers of artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order) was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publications, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the leading artificial intelligence companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the best American player Othello, while later he was an executive executive of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged the importance of previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would be held, to identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that gets the best of academia, it's the companies," he said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired authority from universities to work on artificial intelligence issues in recent years.
Lee argued that changes in immigration policy could also help the US support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that a green card should be automatically offered to PhD holders in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China issued a Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations hand out money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is inferior, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, in which partners from the business and academia will join, and the White House announced the formation of an Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Science Foundation currently invests more than $100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made in U.S. legislation for months aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia participated in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country would be renamed the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that had blocked the country's candidacy to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that the northern neighbour's name represents a claim over its territories and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether participation will reach the required 50 percent for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was this: "You are in favour of joining NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece."
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to seek membership in organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, so that Macedonian youth can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that way the lives of all of us will be safer," Olivera Georgievska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, several members of parliament have stated that they will comply with the result of the vote, to make it definitive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission stated that there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters were present.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoraf Zaev, his wife Zorika and son Dusko voted in the referendum to change the name of the country that would pave the way for the country's NATO and European Union membership in the Macedonian city of Strumika on September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small tent and places chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not as second-class partners," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a positive result would be "the affirmation of our future."
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, the referendum would involve between 30 and 43 percent of voters, i.e. below the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, 57 percent of those polled planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote positively.
For the referendum to be successful, membership must reach 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since its rise to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes Brighton's entire defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling finished Brighton's defense by winning 2-0 for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed up to score easily in the 65th minute.
The Argentine quarterback received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the phase.
He passed three Brighton defenders before spilling into the open space.
Aguero was then found surrounded by four green players.
He dribbled through one defender, then escaping from several others on the edge of Brighton's large area.
Then, he gave a pass to his left, finding Stirling.
The English forward made his first move in the area returning the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to defeat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, scoring on the right side of the nets.
"Aguero is facing some problems on his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We told him to play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to score goals at the time."
However, it was Stirling who gave the blues the initial advantage in the Battle of the Premier League.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful ball across the left side to Leroy Sane.
SanÃ© kept the ball in his possession and guided Sterling to the rear beam.
The blues forward kicked the ball in the net just before it went out.
City faces Hoffenheim in the Champions League groups on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Serzer wants to beat the Rockys
As the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to try to make another start.
But the ever-competitive Serger hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still repercussions for the Rockies in the playoffs, as they lead by a Los Angeles Dodgers game in the National League West.
The Rockys have gone into the playoffs with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to lock up first place in their division.
"Although we have nothing to gain, at least we can play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will be a game probably of the highest level I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight in a race like this?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who the original pitcher will be on Sunday, but reportedly tend to let Serzer throw the ball.
Serzer, who will make his 34th start, made coaching throws on Thursday and will play on Sunday, which is normally a rest day for him.
The right-handed man from Washington has an 18-7 performance with an average winning points (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 outs due to strike in 220 2/3 periods this season.
Trump delivers speech in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation regarding his chosen Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh, in a speech about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important electoral processes in our lives.
It's a very important moment; I'm not a candidate, but actually it's like I am and, for that reason, I travel everywhere to support excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say: "You see this wretched, wretched radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power using any necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to exterminate to take power and control, because what they want is power and control and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have undertaken a "resistance and obstruction" mission.
"And you've been seeing this for the last four days," he said, describing the Democrats as "angry and bad, miserable and lying."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by name making mention of Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, a report which was received with strong disapproval from the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you reveal the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, oh no, I'm waiting for an answer. That was a really bad use of body language, the worst use of body language I've ever seen"
The Labour Party is no longer a broad party.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion
I was not at all surprised that activists of the Momedum movement in my local group voted to impeach me.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs to whom they have said they are not welcome, precisely because we speak our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan had a similar attitude, because she fought back decisively against anti-Semitism.
In my case, my motion of censure was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, oddly enough, on similar issues to those Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders about.
The call for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "we want our meetings to be productive with everyone's participation."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the General Commission meetings on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately, today, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more compassionate, more compassionate" policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever really began to materialize.
It is obvious more and more often that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I previously thought we had similar political views began to expect me to take a 180-degree turn and adopt views with which I would never agree, whether these were about national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I spoke in public, no matter what I was really saying, I was listening to a blazing on social media, where people were asking for my rejection, they renounced the policy of the center and told me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than other colleagues, as the comments directed at me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults daily, but never give up.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era in politics is how insults are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad party and that with every motion of censure or change of the rules of choice, the limits of the party are narrowed.
I have been advised many times in the last two years not to stand up, not to talk too much and that so "everything will be all right".
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party, 32 years ago, as a student still, because of the neglect shown by the Thatcher government which literally led to the failure of my entire class, my purpose has been to defend better public services for those who need them most, whether as a member of the local council or as a minister of government.
I never hid my politics and I did the same in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused in any way regarding my political views and points of disagreement with today's leadership.
To those who pushed the motion of censure on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country is facing a Brexit that will hit our households, businesses and public service, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I'm loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, really, my only message is not addressed to members of the Momentum movement in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political expediency will prevent me from acting as I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Air - Melrose: 38 - 17: Unbeatable Air climbs to the top
Two late goals may have twisted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this extremely entertaining current Tened championship match.
It is now at the top of the rankings, the only undefeated team out of ten.
Ultimately, it was her superior defense, as well as the best exploitation of opportunities, that tilted the scales in favor of the homeowners and coach Peter Murchi had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose stated: "Congratulations to Ire, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, with Frasier Clemo's conversion, brought Air ahead, but a yellow card to Scottish Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggot scored a goal without conversion.
Clemo increased Air's lead by a penalty, before scoring, right at halftime, a goal by conversion, leading Air to the locker room by a score of 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's goal, with Baggot's conversion, reduced the lead to five points.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury by Ruarid Nott, who was removed on a stretcher, and, after the restart, Ire further increased the difference with a Stafford McDowall goal, with a conversion of Clemo.
Substitute captain Blair McPherson then took a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the numerical advantage with Bruce Colvin's goal without conversion, after a period of intense pressure.
The hosts came back, however, and, when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow tackle card to Clemo without the ball, off the penalty line, McPherson scored a goal on the back of the attack launched by Air.
The Climate made a conversion, as it did again almost from the restart, after Kylie Rowe picked up David Armstrong's kick and sent extrem Gregor Henry away for the fifth goal of the hosts.
Still Game star starts new career in focus
The star of the series Still Game Ford Kiernan looks ready to switch to the catering industry after it was revealed that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and in which he co-stars with his long-time partner in the comedy Greg Hebphil.
The couple announced that the upcoming fifth season will also be the last of the show and it appears Kiernan is planning his life after Gagland.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the information, even though a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan wants to deal with the "growing branch of focus" in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Enclosed Bolivia hopes court will reopen road to Pacific
Sailors patrol the navy's fully equipped headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings are waving blue flags.
At the naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is written the slogan: "The sea belongs to us rightfully.
It's our duty to get her back."
Across the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline Chile conquered after a bloody conflict over the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the longing of its people to travel to the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have risen today more than ever, in decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the dynamics, a spirit of unity and calm, and naturally awaits the result with a positive look," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice's ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia's claim to force Chile, after decades of fickle talks, to negotiate for Bolivia to grant a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous President, who is fighting a controversial battle for his re-election next year, has much to gain or lose from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is not likely to decide in favor of Bolivia and that, even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the authority to give Chilean territory and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice ruling is to be issued just six months after the final arguments were presented suggests that the case "wasn't complicated," said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law issues.
And instead of further advancing Bolivia's goals, the past four years may have undermined them.
"The current Bolivian government has usurped the issue of access to the sea," Zarate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has exhausted every remaining good mood of Chile, he argued.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velje, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually rapid.
On Monday Bolivia will get "an excellent opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and the ability to "end 139-year-old disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular leaders, is using the issue of exiting the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the US
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, states that his state will never disarm its nuclear weapons first, if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the heads of the two states.
Ri made these comments while U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears ready to relaunch nuclear diplomacy that had reached a quagmire, three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri states that the view that continued sanctions and the U.S. refusal to declare the end of the Korean War will at some point force the North to "breast" is a summer night's dream.
Washington hesitates to agree to issue the declaration if Pyongyang does not make significant disarmament moves first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism as to whether Pyongyang is seriously considering renouncing an arsenal which the country considers likely to be the only means of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Rab summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in oversized hats that will soon be available at a store near you
If you want to grow the collection of hats you have or avoid the sun completely, then stop looking.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented the runway with a series of bizarre oversized hats for their Spring-Summer 2019 collection which stole the show at Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely uncomfortable hats flooded Instagram this summer and the designers sent their impressive creations to the runway.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide bor with wings that completely covered the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories were presented watermelons decorated with gems, a magician's hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and referred more to Hannibal Lecter than to haute couture fashion.
One creation brought to mind complete scuba gear with snorkels and glasses, while another looked like melted ice cream in a funnel.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with the huge accessories, you're lucky.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could reach main shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats made their appearance very quickly after "La Boba", the straw hat with the very wide bor we've seen wearing so many, from Riana to Emily Rataikovsky.
The popular brand that created the extremely uncomfortable hat that flooded social media sent yet another big creation to the runway, a beach bag almost as big as the model carrying it wearing his bathing suit.
The dark orange shelf bag, decorated with shelves fringes and a white leather handle, was the piece that stood out from Jacquemus' La Riviera Spring-Summer 2019 collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told the FEMAIL column: "I expect to see big hats and big beach bags in stores next summer, as the designer made such a big sense that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the world's citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a background in academic excellence, which continued into 2018, with yet another series of outstanding exam results, which were simply further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports, the arts, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of service to students and their parents.
The goal of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and highest educational grades, the professional career they will choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational field that can design and implement a school curriculum on-demand, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable elective course in schools.
Nelson Mandela had said: "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, then what you say goes into their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say goes into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot simply rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's exams, we find that languages are at the top of the performance tables, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a baccalaureate A degree.
Data gathered from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved an A baccalaureate degree in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also had an A grade.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages today, as a elective course, are considered as important as courses involving science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Committee in 2014 revealed that, with regard to the reasons why employers found it difficult to fill vacancies, a 17-percent figure involved a lack of language skills.
Therefore, the need to acquire language skills is becoming increasingly imperative so that young people are prepared for their future professional careers.
Since more future employment opportunities require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career one will choose, if one has learned a second language, one will have a real advantage in the future, because of this skill one will be able to utilize throughout one's life.
If one is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were unable to speak any foreign language well enough to have a conversation, while French was the only language to speak a double-digit percentage of respondents (15 percent).
For this reason, investing in language teaching today is important for today's children.
Knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
For whatever your child is interested in, there will always be some languages to choose from in independent schools, which have qualified teaching staff in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds for them.
One cannot deny today that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered truly "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturalism and excellence for Scottish youth.
They have to.
John Edward is director of the Councils of Independent Schools of Scotland.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The anticipation of fans eager to see LeBron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers almost came to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the first game before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet decided how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a few minutes.
After training a few days ago, James was asked about his plans regarding the six-game schedule that the Lakers have to give before the season.
"I don't need preparation fights at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of rallies starting in Willing, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five planned rallies next week, involving tours of friendly adjacent areas, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote of confirmation of his choice for the Supreme Court on hold, Trump seeks to boost popular support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress with the November vote.
What time is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7pm ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's gathering in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to report at this week's hearings on the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Cavanaugh, which took place in a tense atmosphere due to allegations of sexual misconduct, with a Senate confirmation vote that has been put on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigation is under way.
However, the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing a bickering outcome in the November election in order to gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign staff stated that these five gatherings next week are aimed at "mobilizing volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible as we are heading into the busy campaign period," a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who wanted to remain anonymous, told Reuters.
The evening's planned gathering at Willing's Wesbanco Arena could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the month Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrissey, a Republican candidate in West Virginia for the Senate, who is low in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come and try to give him a boost to the polls," said Simon Henderson, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team has the vigor to fight keeping hopes alive as it heads to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday afternoon quads might even have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sports idea, but players believe it deeply, and especially in such confrontations.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
"It was leading six points and now it's four in front, so we probably have a little momentum," said Jordan Spith as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of leading by four points and remaining twelve more in the game.
Americans, Spith says, feel the "air on their sails" and have much to encourage them, such as the twin Spith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each earned three points out of four.
Spith was fatal from tee to green and sets the example.
The voices of the festivities grew louder as he continued his round, striking a crucial blow to get the four all-square game when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The hit with which they won the game in the 15th was accompanied by similar celebrations showing his belief that the American team is not out.
"You have to look deep inside yourself and worry about your own game," Spith said.
It's what each player has left.
18 holes to make history.
The only players with more points than Spith and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's weird but adorable twin has hit four out of four and seems to be doing nothing wrong.
"Mollywood" was the only duo not to hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way the energy seems to flow to and from noisy spectators, seals the fact that it is the players who will have to win on Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory while the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The debate on European glory remains premature.
Baba Watson and Webb Simpson put the glasses on Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
With a bogey and two doubles on the front nine they stuck the Spaniard and the Swede so deep in a hole they couldn't get out of it.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are such exciting games to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant lead on the last day, but this foursome match also showed that the U.S. team has the guts, despite the doubts of some.
Europe takes 10-6 lead on last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after leading Saturday's fourballs and foursomes 10-6 against the US.
The inspirational duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made an impact with two wins against a struggling Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead in Le Golf National so far at four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to preserve the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the misguided American side in the morning fourballs, with a 3-1 streak.
The U.S. resisted the foursomes more, winning two games, but were unable to catch up.
Jim Furrick's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single matches, to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while along with Molinari, also known as "Mollywood", after a staggering weekend he is just the second duo to win four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they joined forces to defeat a tired Woods and American newcomer Bryson DeSabeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who was dragged into Saturday's two games, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven streaks.
Justin Rose, who rested for the fourball mornings, returned to his teammate Henrik Stenson for the foursomes with a 2&1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka, winning first and third place in the world rankings.
Not all went well for Europe, despite the pleasant, cool day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas set the bar for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a difficult 2&1 win over Spain's John Ram and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory Mcilroy 4&3 in the foursome while losing the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history was a team able to recover while losing by four points in the singles, although because he is the trophy winner, Furic is enough to strike a tie to maintain the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday is out of their league.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally without confidence measures
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepen a feeling of distrust of the US and that his country will not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world's annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, e.g. stopping nuclear and ballistic tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities, and a commitment not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see any corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way to unilaterally begin our disarmament."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to the possibility of a "gradual" approach to denuclearization, whereby North Korea would be rewarded as it progressed gradually in the process, his statement was significant in that it did not completely rule out unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri was quoted in Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump's joint communiquÃ© at the first summit that took place between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on "denuclearizing the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks to officially end the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first "deliver" its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls to ease the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the pressure by threatening sanctions to achieve their purpose by blackmailing, even putting obstacles in the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri made no mention of a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader pointed to at the United Nations earlier in the week.
The minister, however, pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the partner in the denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a stalemate."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korean ballistic missiles was inevitable because "Bad President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to proceed with disarmament measures, but said that much still needs to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months, that's okay."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensively and continuously until full, final and confirmed denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to neutralize funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, to be denounced by North Korea a few hours later as having "the demands of a gangster".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex, if the United States were to take "corresponding measures".
He clarified that Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he seeks were security guarantees Trump promised Singapore and promote normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend classes on how to get enough rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University seeks all undergraduate students to sleep more in an effort to combat the growing culture of all-night study by consuming a lot of caffeine.
One academic discovered that students at the world's number 1 university often do not know basic things, e.g. how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaser, a Harvard Medical School professor of Sleep Medicine and a qualified doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I learning about this just now, in my senior year?'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, first started this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to include the course when it was found that students were deprived of sleep within the week to a significant degree.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is the image of a student dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books, to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not directly change the behavior of students.
We believe, however, that they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke," added Professor Chaser.
The culture of being proud because you studied all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a problem that is growing.
Sufficient sleep, good quality, should be the students' "secret weapon" to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into a state of starvation, resulting in a lasting feeling of hunger.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californian who studies Chemistry and Natural Biology, helped Professor Chaser plan the course, having attended one of his classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said his class opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a course across the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar program before starting their studies at this highly competitive educational institution.
Professor Chaser recommended that students set up a notice of the time they should go to bed, as well as an alarm clock for waking time, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, which can defuse the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston - Rangers 1-0: Menga scores to Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad loss away, as Dolly Menga's shot led Stephen Gerard's disoriented side to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox's team sought to score its first away win since February's 4-1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerard's only second loss in 18 games as a coach, leaving the team eight points behind Harts, who is first in the Ladbrokes league rankings.
Menga struck seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' uninspired roster seemed unable to reciprocate.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, with just one goal difference from Hibernian ahead.
And Rangers may be waiting for more trouble, as supervisor Callum Spence has had to receive first aid for a head injury caused by an object thrown off the platform.
Gerard made eight changes to the team's lineup and defeated Eyre in the semi-finals for the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same "Livy 11" lineup that he got a point from Harts last week and would be happy with how this well-oiled machine of his was able to stifle any attempt by the opponents.
Rangers may have dominated the possession, but Livingston did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute, when Menga's first long pass sent Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's area, but the midfielder did not find the ball.
A deep free shot by Keegan Jacobs found Chief Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only send the ball away from the beam.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith for the game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have won a penalty in 15 minutes, as he clashed with Stephen Lawless, but referee Stephen Thompson ignored Colombian's complaints.
Rangers had only two shots within the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not at all alarmed by Lasana Kulibali's header and Ovi Edgeria's subdued shot.
Although in the first 34 minutes of the race Livy was clearly below expectations, no one can deny that she deserved the victory for the effort alone.
Again Rangers failed to address Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and found Menga who simply completed the attempt.
Gerard made halftime changes by taking out Kulibali and putting Ryan Kent in. The change paid off almost immediately, as the extrem passed the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to lure guests into the style of the game she knows and enjoys, with Lithgow and Halkett pulling away one distant ball after another.
Holt's side could have increased the difference towards the end, but McGregor faced Jacobs straight, stopping him before Lithgow's attempt at the corner.
Rangers' substitute, Glenn Middleton, had another penalty phase towards the end, as he clashed with Jacobs, but still Thompson ignored it.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
A page from the almanac Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882: today, 136 years ago and VALE ... the day in Germany the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity; this invention eventually led to the device now known as the Geiger counter.
Pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has gone into the realm of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive metal elements, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you hear the action of atoms caused by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Look, he's acting crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention bearing his name continues her work.
New anti-cancer vaccine teaches immune system to "see" problem cells
New anti-cancer vaccine teaches immune system to "see" problem cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize problem cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can "see" a protein that is common in various types of cancer and then re-inject them
A tested vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine which teaches the immune system to recognize problematic cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory so that they "see" a protein common to many cancers, which is called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzovsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine on our hands."
As Professor Berzovsky explained, the HER2 protein "is the driving force for the development of several types of cancer", such as breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer.
A similar approach in which immune cells are extracted from patients and then "taught" how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West defended Trump, wearing a hat with the slogan MAGA, after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was disapproved in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an erratic interview in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After presenting his third song for the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a baseball cap with the slogan Make America Great Again, he gave a recital of delirium against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talk to a white man and he says to me, 'But how do you like Trump?
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL opened with a sketch starring Matt Damon, with Hollywood star mocking Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasy Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although not broadcast, the video of West's delirium was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear if Rock tried to mock West with this post.
Also, West protested to the public that they did not treat him well backstage because of his hat.
"They bowled me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with the hat."
I was bowled!
And they say I don't know what's happening to me," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "I don't know what's happening to me; I'm going to wear the Superman cape, because that way no one will be able to tell me what to do.
Try Love".
His comments were at least twice frowned upon by the public and SNL contributors seemed to be in a difficult position, Variety reported, with one person stating to the magazine: "In the entire studio there was a funeral silence."
West was called up as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMiller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused several when he sang I Love It dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by Candace Turner, head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: TO THANK YOU FOR RESISTING THE CHILD."
However, the show's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "himself and that's great."
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (buying their music or clothes or supporting their 'art') who I believe espouses and utters ideology which is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that it is now "the being previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Dadi, Puffy and P. Didi.
rapper Snoop Dog had changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course the legend of Prince music had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.
Attempted murder charge over knife attack at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a knife attack on a man in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident occurred in Balihakamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for the role of swordsman John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
However the actor, 31, criticizes the hero's stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen pass on to young boys the message that they should be hard to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said that "something is wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era can be combated.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted to having a "strong opinion" on the issue.
"Personally, now, I believe it very much; where did we make the mistake of masculinity?", he said.
"What do we teach men as they get older, about the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity because of the masculine characters it promotes.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they must display such behavior to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time.
Clearly something has gone wrong with our young people."
In the interview he also admitted that he does not intend to play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones, after the series ends the following summer, saying "end of battles and horses".
From November, Kit will star in the revival of Sam Sheppard's True West play, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that his acquaintance with his wife Rose is the best he gained from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in a row, so she kind of gave me my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritt, the erotic repressed character of John Snow, the character played by Kit, in the Emmy-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new incidents
China announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health services.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority, new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, marking a change over the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was nearly zero, as had been stated by health officials of China at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a very serious issue for China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains a common phenomenon.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies executive leaked data of Republican senators, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
This Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters refuted allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information of three Republican senators on the lawmaker's Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic congresswoman of Los Angeles argued that the allegations were being promoted by commentators and "far right" websites.
"Lies, lies and even more awful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Published information reportedly includes the residence addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and appears to have been published by an unidentified person from the Capitol Hill environment during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Cavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, said that the IP address identifying the source of the postings was associated with Waters' office and published the details of a member of Waters' staff, The Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is a completely untrue and blatant lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information, and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false claims, was in no way responsible for leaking that information.
This unfounded claim is a completely untrue and blatant lie."
Waters' statement quickly came under criticism on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of anger, Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that he does not have the vigor to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
He must not be impudent.
He should not question the motives of the one who accuses him.
He must be calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by his critics of looking very angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to depose Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's real," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false allegations."
"We will do everything to find those responsible," he continued, "and answer for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to anyone and all my staff members."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - a sluggish spy film with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for signs of Brexit in every new film with a British character and this seems to be true in this revival of the action-comedy franchise starring Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back in 2011 with Johnny English: The Return.
Can this humorous self-satray about how obviously crappy we are become the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the gleaming eyes was able to renew his license to screw it up a second time. His name states that it is a wider comic creation designed for non-English-speaking movie viewers.
It is, of course, about the fickle secret agent who while pretending to have the glow and manners of a secret agent, brings a little to Clouseau, with a dose of "Mr. Bean" and something from the guy who played a single note on the musical theme of the film The Streets of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also based on the traveler and international mystery man once played by Atkinson in Barclaycard's most forgotten television commercials, wreaking chaos in his wake.
There are one or two nice moments in this last JE film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propellers hit his helmet.
Atkinson shows his talent for comedy, however, humor is quite subdued and oddly extravagant, especially at the time when "serious" film franchises such as the 007 and Dangerous Mission now include several comic elements.
Humor seems to appeal to children rather than adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English's crazy misadventures are not as inventive and relevant as Atkinson's silent-film type sketches for Bean's persona.
The eternal central issue is that Great Britain has a serious problem.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated Britain's super secret web of spies, putting out the identity of all Britain's agents on mission, much to the dismay of the agent on duty, played by Kevin Eldon in a unfortunately small role for his range.
She is the last straw for a pompous and ambitious prime minister on the verge of collapse due to political anti-popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this character who reminds Theresa May, but the script doesn't help her very much.
Intelligence advisors inform her that, as every active spy has been revealed, she will have to reinstate someone decommissioned.
And that means Johnny Inglis, who now works as a principal at some prestigious school, but gives informal lessons for secret agents: here are some nice scenes, as Inglis offers a very Rock School-like spy academy.
Inglis returns to Whitehall for urgent briefing and reunites with Buff's former and suffering partner, again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role in which Vicky Pepperdin is not fully exploited.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the blunder for His Majesty's Secret Service return to the action, meeting the beautiful and fatal Buletova Benefit played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously fascinated by the charismatic technology billionaire she claims can solve Britain's technological woes: the threatening Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
Inglis and Buff embark on the odyssey of their farsocomy: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a lavish French restaurant, cause chaos as they attempt to board Volta's luxury yacht illegally, and Inglis causes anarchy as he attempts to use a virtual reality device to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the tricks are used in this last scene, but as lovely and fussy as it is, it continues to remind a little of children's television.
Moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English movies I wonder: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he will really thrive on his talent?
Labour denies considering a plan for the British to work four days, but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but be paid for five days' work.
The party is reportedly seeking corporate bosses to channel the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, giving them an extra free day.
Thus, workers will enjoy a three-day weekend, without a reduction in their salary.
Sources say the idea goes hand in hand with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the scales in favour of the workers.
The change to a four-day week was approved by the Labor Unions Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A change of policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is an ambition that aligns with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall strategy for industry."
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party."
The shadow government secretary, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour conference to develop his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he is determined to regain power from "impersonal managers" and "profiters" in utilities.
The plans of the shadow government secretary also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire share back, as a potential Labour government could make "withholdings" due to suspected mischief.
It also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and create equity participation funds to give 10% of private sector companies to employees who will receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds sterling.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy speak on 60 Minutes on whether the FBI's investigation of Cavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could affect some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a correspondent for 60 Minutes, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could flush out anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said that on my way to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and asked him directly: "Did you do it?"
He was unmoved, determined, categorical."
However, Graham's vote seems not to change.
"I have decided on Brett Cavanaugh and it will take some explosive accusation to change my mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasy Ford.
"And whoever he has named, he cannot confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how much has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a rich program and well-known stars, but also an equally impressive mission: to eradicate global poverty.
For the seventh year now, tens of thousands are projected to flock to Great Lawn, Central Park as part of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal, which is to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of those actively fighting against it.
To secure a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), stakeholders had to complete a series of missions or "actions", such as declaring volunteers, sending an email to a world leader, calling or finding other meaningful ways to help raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while there are still 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of a reward with a free concert the proper way to convince our fellow citizens to take action or is it just another instance of so-called "climaticism", when some feel they are actually making a difference by signing an electronic request or sending a tweet?
As of 2011, the Global Citizen group says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, promoting a number of different goals.
It says these actions helped world leaders announce commitments and policies that correspond to more than $37 billion, which are set to affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements as a result of these actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the secured funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and implementers, who have made a commitment "to help children reach their full potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to eradicate malnutrition, having received over 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said Tracy Ulman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, to the public during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called The Power of Nutrition, which is aimed at 5 million women and children with dietary interventions.
Answering the question "what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?" included in the site's frequently asked questions,
a member of the Global Citizen community replied: "The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all the major human rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, Wiked, Sean Mendes, Cardi Bee and Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will appear at this year's event in New York City, which Deborah-Lee Farnes and Hugh Jackman will present.
US may use Navy for 'exclusion' by blocking Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary Â· Global Voices
Washington may turn "if necessary" to its Navy in order to prevent Russian energy from being placed on the markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where it is attempting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reasons why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just like they do in eastern and southern Europe," he reportedly said.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to counter Russian activity.
"The United States has the ability, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, to exclude them, to ensure that Russian energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group described as the "power consumer voice" in the US.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are essentially the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, fuel utilization and replacement," he said, referring to Russia as "a pony that knows only one trick", as it has an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made as the Trump administration has undertaken the mission to boost exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, Trump's administration, including President Donald Trump himself, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that, according to Trump, will make Berlin Moscow's "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a project with a budget of $11 billion, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's vigorous resistance to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be allowed to choose the gas supplier they want," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance provoked Germany's reaction, which stressed its commitment to the project's implementation.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when some third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting he had with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for the presidency in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider running for the presidency after the midterm elections.
At a meeting at Hallouk, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering the possibility.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our troubled government, and that's why it needs a woman at the top," he said according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider the possibility of a nomination for the presidency."
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the meeting, saying she "leads the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren did not chew on her words about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said that "of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote".
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren's voters do not believe she should run for the presidency in 2020.
58% of Massachusetts' "possible" electors said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32% were in favour of such a nomination.
The poll highlighted more support for a possible nomination than former governor Devall Patrick, with 38% in favour of a possible nomination and 48% against.
Other popular names from Democrats discussed in connection with a possible 2020 nomination are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would have formally decided by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin referred to Trak Palin's Post-traumatic Stress Disorder at Donald Trump's rally
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"With what my son has been going through since he returned, I can understand other families living with the effects of PTSD and the injuries our soldiers carry when they return home," he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "a bomb ready to explode" and said of her son and other veterans that they "return a little different, return tougher, return wondering if there is respect for what soldiers, airmen and every other member of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wassila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering in a report of domestic violence and gun possession while in a state of drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wassila Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims trying to escape gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted an amicus curiae report Friday in Washington supporting an asylum seeker to challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" abused her, however, U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
He had been held in Texas.
Lawyers for the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of U.S. asylum seekers come, as countries facing intense gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision taken by the Appeals Committee on Immigration (BIA) and allowed undocumented migrants fleeing domestic violence situations to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "ignores entire decades of state, federal and international law."
"Under federal law, all asylum claims must be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application; such an impediment violates this principle," according to the amicus curiae report.
Lawyers also claimed in the report that the policy denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "be a necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration court judges to no longer grant asylum to victims trying to escape domestic violence situations and gangs.
"The asylum is available for those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or intimidation on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political view," Sessions said in his June 11 announcement about the policy.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems (even the most serious) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, as death toll doubles despite struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very intense," said 35-year-old mother Riza Kusuma, trying to relieve her fever-stricken baby at an evacuation center set up in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances bring in more bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Some residents attempted to return to their destroyed homes and collect their belongings through the waters, trying to salvage what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale, were unable to meet the needs.
Some wounded, such as Dui Harris, who suffered a fracture of the waist and shoulder, remained outside Palu Army Hospital, where first aid was given to the countryside due to the ongoing strong aftershocks.
Tears flooded his eyes as he recounted how he felt the violent earthquake shake the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to be saved.
I was trapped in the wreckage of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence prevailed.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper citing the mutual commercial benefits between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread its propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump cited last Wednesday in the paid China Daily insert that appeared in the Des Moines Register, the most-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 congressional election, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing attempted to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters is a new phase of the escalating campaign Washington has launched in order to put pressure on China.
Although foreign governments are not prohibited from publishing advertisements to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a escalating trade war and have reciprocally imposed various tariffs on imports.
China's tariff retaliation at the beginning of the trade war was aimed at hurting exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstadt, U.S. ambassador to China and a former long-serving governor in Iowa, a state that is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt America's workers, farmers and businesses.
China, as Branstadt wrote in an opinion piece in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "is engaging in this kind of bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"In trying to spread this propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting America's precious tradition of free speech and free press by publishing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstadt wrote.
"In contrast, in the Beijing pavilions, you will find few divergent voices and no true representation of the different views the Chinese people may have on China's troubled economic course, given that the media is under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers avoided offering to publish" his article, though he did not disclose which.
Republicans estrange female voters ahead of mid-term election over Kavanaugh fiasco, analysts warn
As many top Republicans continue to defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh despite allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn there will be a backlash, particularly from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Feelings about this issue are particularly tense and most Republicans have stated that they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be restored," Grant Reer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill, in regards to an article published Saturday.
Rier doubts that the last-minute move by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to request an investigation by the FBI will be enough to attract angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and they are certainly not going to forget it in November," Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan "November is coming!" in the Senate corridor as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee gave the go-ahead for Cavanaugh's nomination, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasy Ford, Mic reported.
"The Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation will reach record levels," Stu Rodenberg, an unpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29 who, while disliking the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which she detailed her allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts had predicted there might be a backlash as long as Republicans go ahead with the nomination.
"It's a huge mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote in committee or the final vote or whether Cavanaugh will be put out; it's also about how the Republicans handled the issue and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group that helps elect the Democrats, told a news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the statements of Fortn and Cavanaugh, slightly more in favour of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or likely believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or likely believed Cavanaugh.
Additionally, 38% said they believed Cavanaugh likely or certainly lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's move, the FBI undertook to investigate Ford's complaints and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavanaugh attacked her while he was drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals while they were at a party, when both were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new work of this technology legend is Inrupt, a company based on Berners Lee's open platform Solids.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored, as well as who will be able to access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment".
The application uses Solid platform technology allowing users to create their own "personal electronic data storage" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at once.
The unique feature of personal electronic data storage is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls this capability "personal empowerment through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is for the company to offer resources, processes and appropriate skills so the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company consists of Berners Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers who worked on the project and a community of volunteer code programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they are allowed to make radical changes, overturning business models overnight.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a Medium post released on Saturday, Berners Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web created based on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a strong voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about the next age of the Internet," Berners Lee added.
Bernard Van: A tribute to a clergyman who received the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Anglican Church clergyman to have received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier was honored at home 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van received the medal on 29 September 1918, for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had gained the highest British military distinction.
Saturday saw the unveiling of a commemorative plaque by his two grandsons, which was accompanied by a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, stated that it was "extremely symbolic" that the unveiling of the plaque took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act for which he received the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt. Col. Van led his battalion to the Saint-Kentin Canal amid very thick fog and while receiving heavy fire from combat weapons and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the front line and with "excellent bravery" led the line forward, before hitting himself with a combat weapon three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's heroic actions were "something I know I could never reach, it's something that makes you feel boundless respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also deposited a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that he "felt great honor for participating in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a genuine hero is evidenced by the support he has from many people."
MMA fans stayed up to watch Bellator 206, but saw Peppa the Pig
Consider this scenario: you've been up all night to watch the exciting Bellator 206, but you're denied the joy of seeing this unique sporting event.
The program in San Jose included 13 matches, including six on the main card, and would be aired live in the UK, from Channel 5, in the night zone.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Musashi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to go out in the ring, viewers in the United Kingdom were left stilted when the show changed to Peppa the Pig.
Some were not happy at all, as they had stayed awake until the early hours of the morning especially for the race.
A Twitter fan described viewing the children's program as "some kind of sick joke".
"Under the legislation, this content was not suitable for 6 am, so the children's program had to be shown," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Pig, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Cocker, said they are going to edit the program to include UK viewers in the future.
"If we think about the replays, I think we can do it," Cocker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning there and we won't be able to do it until Sunday our own time, i.e. their Monday.
But we're trying.
Believe me, when the change was made, a lot of messages were exchanged back and forth and were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't, it was because of the regulations.
I promise you that next time that's not going to happen.
We'll narrow it down to five games instead of six, as we usually do; we've tried to offer more to the fans and we've gone too far.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of his sexuality
The Olympic diver, Tom Daley, said he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, however, this prompted him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize by high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he supported gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that since he became a parent, he is less interested in a win at the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular host of the well-known radio show, was on leave for several months due to illness.
As a guest on Laverne's first show, Daly said he felt "inadequate" compared to others when he was growing up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like someone and boys and girls."
He stated: "To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity gave me the strength and the will to succeed."
He wanted to prove that it was "something," he said, so he wouldn't let anyone down when they would eventually find out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is a prominent defender of the rights of the LGBTQI community and took advantage of his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to proceed with the decriminalization of homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live openly, without repercussions, and that he wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion stated that he was "surprised" when he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married Oscar-winning Dustin Lance Black, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but argued that the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such an early age" (he first participated in Olympic Games at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it's hard to find a peer who has similar good and bad times."
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley stated that he changed "his whole perspective".
"If you asked me last year, all I wanted was to win the gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had made tickets to the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'Dad, you won't be around to sit in the front row'," he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and was dead did I finally accept that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew it was everything I've dreamed of all my life, to compete in diving at the Olympics in my home country, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song, Heather Small's Proud, which encouraged him in his preparation for the Olympics and still gives him chills.
Desert Island Discs broadcasts on BBC Radio 4, every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of form Mickelson will sit on the bench Saturday at the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mikkelson will set a record on Sunday, when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his performance in order not to remember him for the wrong reasons.
Mikelson, who participates for the 12th time (record number) in the games held every two years, was forced by captain Jim Furrick to sit on the bench for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it is customary for the United States, the five-time winner divided the day up by cheering off the lines and "working" his game in the hope that he would correct his problematic points.
Without ever having been the straightest driver even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old's game is not suitable for Le Golf National's narrow field, where distant ones are often problematic.
And as if the difficulty of the field was not enough, Mikkelson, in Sunday's ninth match, faces Francesco Molinari, champion of the British Open, who is teaming up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, Mikkelson's game can be crucial.
Furrick expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he is playing today, hit me on the back amicably, put his hand around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furrick said.
"He's very confident.
His name is in the Hall of Fame and he has offered too much to these teams, both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't count on him playing two games.
I was thinking more, but that's where we ended up and so we thought we had to go.
He wants to go out there, like everybody else."
Mikkelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Sunday matches in the Ryder Cup.
It could mean the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that did not reach the height of his individual record.
Mikelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furrick stated that his presence had benefits for the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to make jokes and he's excellent in the group room," he explained.
"I think the younger players were also having fun teasing him this week.
His contribution is not only in the game."
The leader of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the big lead may soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from his experience that a big lead starting from the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a defeat.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Balesteros managed to get a five-point advantage over the Americans, but barely managed to cross the final line by a breast difference, winning 141-2-131-2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but barely," Bjorn said, in the picture, after watching the 2018 generation win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday and lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and all the team members that this is not over.
We're going all set tomorrow to give it all away.
We're going out there and we're going to play right.
Nothing is over until you see the grades on the board.
We have a goal, to win this trophy, and that's where we focus.
I always say I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we know very well that there are equally good players on the other team â€“ the best in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I would not be in a hurry to prejudge the result.
Tomorrow is another beast.
Individual performance counts tomorrow and that's something different.
It's great to be on the field with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're out there on your own, then you try your skills to the fullest as a golfer.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, how to get their best out tomorrow.
You leave your teammate behind and he has to give it all and show his best."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furrick from the opposing team will ask his players to score better individual performances than those they had with their teammates, excluding Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furrick himself has experienced both extremes of the last day's twists, as he belonged to the winning team at Brookline before the unexpected defeat, as Europe performed its miracle.
"I remember every damn word of it," he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the leader in 1999, had rallied his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like in Brookline, like in Medinah.
When we get that momentum, there's a lot of pressure in the mid-races.
We decide our turn accordingly and we play in the order that suits us, we will try to do our magic tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with leading the race and faces Rory Mcilroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the rest of the Europeans in the top half of the series.
"I went with this team in this order because I think it covers the whole route," Bjorn said justifying his choices for the singles.
New postponement for Germany's new warship
The new German Navy frigate should have been put into service in 2014, to replace the aging Cold War-era warships, but it is not to be picked up until at least next year, due to faulty systems and soaring costs, local media say.
The post in service of the Rheinland-Pfalz frigate, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a spokesman for the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems with delivery have been decisive for the fate of the ambitious plan.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
They will carry a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as it will be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years outside German ports.
However, the constant delays mean that although warships are considered state-of-the-art, allowing Germany to show its strength abroad, by the time they are finally put into service, they will already be outdated, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to pick up the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
Not much information has been known about the reasons for the return, but German media reported a number of significant "defects with software and hardware" that would put the warship into disuse if used on a combat mission.
The software problems were particularly important; as Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships have a crew of about 120 seamen, just half as compared to older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship has a much greater weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz frigate is believed to be twice the weight of similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost for the whole project (including crew training) was also an issue.
It is said to have reached the staggering amount of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion euros), while the original budget was 2.2 billion euros.
The problems plaguing the new frigates are particularly important since Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the Navy "will soon have no ships for missions".
The official said the problem swelled over time because the old ships were decommissioned, but there were no other ships to replace them.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
New research conducted on an estate in the Highlands of Scotland seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting their food.
The findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help plan future actions to protect the environment.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will explore the habits of the common nanobat and microbat, as well as the brown toad and the mytilla of Dobpenton at Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the estate to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile searches using hand detectors.
Analysis of the sound of all recordings by experts will ascertain the frequency of bat calls, as well as what species have this behavior.
A habitat map and an exhibition will then be created to form a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, a natural environment protection consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management, such as grassland creation and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly since the last century.
They are threatened by the building and development projects that affect the places where they roost and destroy their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting are also a danger, as are fly duct tapes and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to identify insects and obstacles in the course of their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, considers bats very important.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, inspect the places where bats roost and sometimes rescue them.
The organization has also set up Scotland's first and only bat shelter exclusively on the Threeve estate, in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species live.
The estate manager, David Thompson, states that the estate is the ideal ground for bats.
"Here at Threeve we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of big trees and an ideal habitat.
There's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to increase their populations."
He stresses that it is important to first check for the existence of bats before any house maintenance work, as the destruction of a single nest with young could kill up to 400 females and young, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Bats are protected species and are prohibited from killing, harassing or disturbing their privacy, or destroying their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an executive of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland encouraged the public to offer his assistance.
He said: "There's a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of our species we just don't know the evolution of their population."
Ronalto denies rape allegations as his lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying that some "want to project themselves" by taking advantage of his name.
His lawyers are to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The striker of the Portuguese national team and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman, named Catherine Mayorga, in the room of a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
According to the complaint, he allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence and not report anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers after the complaint, Ronalto, 33, described the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Golden Ball winner said on camera.
"They want to project themselves and take advantage of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
I am happy and all is well," added the player smiling.
Ronalto's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations he published, which they described as "unacceptable reporting of rumors that touch privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Skerts said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage of a height commensurate with the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious privacy violations in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting them at a nightclub, Ronalto and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her rather than nature according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronalto fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" a "good guy", but was betrayed by the other "one percent".
The documents state that Ronalto admits that they had had sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and to a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she "feared the possibility of retaliation" and was concerned about her "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she is trying to overturn the settlement as she continues to suffer from post-traumatic syndrome because of the alleged incident.
Ronalto was on the verge of transferring to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged abuse and this summer he switched to Italian Juventus securing a â‚¬100m deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' loss of carmakers Â· Global Voices
The United Kingdom will "repent forever" if it loses its reputation as a world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clarke.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Bernaston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car industry said the impact of cross-border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The plant in Burnaston, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis models are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be discontinued," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's Chief Executive Officer in Bernaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal in terms of cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern risks in the supply chain according to the car companies in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line follows the just-in-time; spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on demand.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be border problems, resulting in delays and a lack of components according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU "is specifically attempting to resolve the issue of cross-border controls."
"We need a deal; we want the best deal possible that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today show.
"The elements that come not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers are that the continuity of supply chains must necessarily be ensured."
Toyota was unable to say how much plaid it would stop production, however, it warned that in the long run additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and is the union head of Unite at the factory, said union members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may "delay another week", as controversy over the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Cavanaugh, has continued, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, Trump's connections with Russia, and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
The possibility that Trump would fire the deputy attorney general, endangering Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wiretap in order to document his talks with Trump and allow the removal of the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, last Monday he went to the White House amid reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order not to coincide with the hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in which both Cavanaugh and one of the women accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasy Ford.
On Friday Trump instructed the FBI to conduct an investigation within a week into the allegations against Cavanaugh, further delaying a vote by the Senate plenary.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's spokesperson, appeared on the Fox News Sunday television show.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "There is no date set yet, maybe it will be this week, but maybe another week will be postponed given all the other cases the supreme court is dealing with.
But we'll see, after all I like to always keep the press up to date."
Some journalists refuted this claim: Sanders has had a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why this is happening.
Sanders responded that the limited frequency of updates was not due to distaste for the "impression" movements of television journalists, although she stated: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are being displayed."
He then hinted that there would be increased or direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The President is giving more interviews than any previous president," he said, adding without quoting: "We looked at these numbers."
Updates will continue to be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has the ability to address questions directly to the President of the United States, that is incomparably better than talking to me.
We've been trying to apply it a lot and you've seen that we've been implementing it a lot over the last few weeks and it will take the place of press briefing where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when leaving the White House or participating in open meetings or press conferences with official visitors.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably proved why this is the case, with an unconventional and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled journalists.
Health Minister sends letter to EU citizens working in Scotland's National Health System amid Brexit fears
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU citizens employed in Scotland's National Health System to express the country's gratitude and to wish them to stay after the UK leaves the European Union.
Jean Freeman, a Scottish MP, sent a letter while less than six months remain for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of applications for permanent resident status ("settled status") for EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Mrs Freeman wrote in her letter: "During the summer negotiations continued between the United Kingdom and the EU on the withdrawal and are heading towards expected decisions in the fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario of not reaching an agreement.
I know that this period must be particularly difficult for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate each employee's contribution regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury in Saturday's match, where the Tennessee State Tigers were defeated 31-27 by the Vanderbilt Commodores, as reported by Tennesseean journalist Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the bench and just collapsed there," Reid said.
The gymnasts and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the bench and then put him on a stretcher and carried him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State executive told Chris Harris from WSMV television station in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was released from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no more data on the type/expansion of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore student under limited membership ("redshirt"), is in his first season in Tennessee State following his transfer from Illinois.
He made five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, thus reaching 18 total tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp fee for buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will incur a higher stamp fee for buying real estate in the UK, while the extra funds will be used to help the homeless, according to the Tories' new plans
The measure will counteract the success of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will be imposed on those buyers who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to 120 million pounds per year - to provide assistance to the homeless
Foreign buyers will begin imposing a higher stamp fee to buy real estate in the UK, while the extra funds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to counteract the success of Jeremy Corbin's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more economic housing and to target high-payers.
The increase in the stamp fee will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the UK, while the extra funds will strengthen the government's campaign to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, imposed on the current stamp fee, along with the highest tax rates introduced two years ago for the purchase of a second residence and houses for lease, may amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to yield up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by people who do not reside in the UK, leading to an increase in prices and making it more difficult for home buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy is introduced just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp fee so that more young people can obtain their first residence.
He accused the major construction companies of keeping property prices high, but acquiring land without using it and called on Mrs May to remove the caps on economic housing in order to restore Britain's "cruel disgrace".
Mr. Corbin announced a series of impressive proposed housing reforms, including rent checks and a ban on evictions "without fault".
He also wishes to give greater powers to the councils in order to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - to improving life for every new generation.
And that implies repairing the broken property market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a life here.
However, it would not be right for persons who do not live in the UK and companies based abroad to buy homes as easily as hard-working British nationals.
For too many people the dream of owning a home has now become too distant and the indignity of homelessness remains real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to coach the Scotland team"
Sunderland captain Jack Ross states that his "absolute ambition" is to become Scottish national team coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is excited about the challenge of resurrecting the northeast England team, which is currently in third place in England's Third League Football League (League One), three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer, after previously bringing St. Mirren back to the Scottish Championship the previous season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I received a call for the second national team and that was it," Ross told the BBC of Scotland on the Sportsound radio show.
"But I grew up watching the Scottish team in Hampden all the time with my dad as a kid, and that's something that always drew me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I have success in team training."
Among Ross' predecessors in Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyette, and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloa Athletic's former coach says he did not feel awe when he was called upon to succeed such established names in such a large team, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Right now the success for me will be measured based on the answer to the question 'Can I bring this team back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities of this team, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy job to get her there, but I'll probably consider myself successful here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross began his career as a coach just three years ago, having spent a time as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint at Harts' coaching staff.
He then helped Aloa return from relegation to the third division and led St. Miren from the brink of relegation to winning the Championship the following season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he said recalling taking over the position of Aloa coach.
"I really thought it suited me more to be a coach than a player.
It sounds weird because I was doing well, making decent money out of it and I had gotten pretty high.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to endure a lot on a weekly basis.

I've always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I've felt with myself all my adult life."

The best time for beer is at 5.30pm on Saturdays, according to a survey
The summer heat wave boosted profits for Britain's tested pubs but brought more pressure to restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant profits fell by 4.8 percent, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consulting firm, who gathered the data, said: "Continuous sunshine and greater than expected England's participation in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern as last month, in June, where pub profits increased by 2.8 percent, but restaurants suffered an even greater blow.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant revenues in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars serving alcohol did far better, with the corresponding figures of previous years having risen more than the corresponding figures of restaurants dropped.
Food-serving pubs also suffered on sunny days, though not as dramatically as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Across all managed pubs and bars, liquor sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales dropped by three percent."
Paul Newman, from RSM's leisure and hospitality analyst division, said: "These results confirm the trend we've seen since late April.
The weather and influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of sales in the off-home market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, but falling sales by 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have appeared at a worse time for entrepreneurs in the catering industry and time will tell if the lower temperatures we experienced in August will give a much-needed extension."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, rose to 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.

One in five children keep secret social media accounts, hidden from their parents
As the survey reveals, one in five children â€“ even just 11 years old â€“ keep secret social media accounts, hidden from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake pages ("fake Insta") on Instagram
This news intensified fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of the students said they have a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children - even just 11 years old - create social media accounts, which they secretly keep from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake "fake Insta" accounts - this is a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
This news intensified fears that sexual content was being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they maintain a healthy "main" account to show their parents, while also maintaining private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, spotted a teenage girl who urged others to rape her ("rape me").
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of School Directors and Directors (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted to keeping hidden accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers succumb to the temptation to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot locate them."
Eilind Doyle will be the "sportsman's voice" on the Scottish track board
Eilind Doyle was elected as a non-executive director to the Scottish Athletics Council at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning track athlete and President Ian Beatty commented on her election as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from her wide-ranging international experience over the past decade.
"Eylind enjoys infinite respect across the Scottish, British and global track community and we are confident that the track in Scotland will have a huge benefit from entering the board," Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can actually contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the gold medal in the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, having won a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular commentator at the BBC, was paralyzed after a transient ischemic stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell whether or not I'm going to recover.
It was exhausting, but I fully recovered, I learned to walk again and today I do agility exercises!
Thanks for the encouraging messages!"
A nipple ad comparing mothers to cows divides online public opinion
A nipple production company has divided online public opinion with an ad comparing nursing mothers to cows milking them.
In order to launch the so-called "world's first silent and wearable breast pump", consumer technologies company Elvie released a humorous video clip-inspired ad to highlight the freedom it offers nursing mothers the new breast pump.
Four real mothers dance inside a cow barn filled with hay, with a song that includes lyrics such as "Yes, I am milking myself, but you don't see any tails" and "In case you didn't notice, these aren't masts, they are my tits."
The choir continues: "Hand it, hand it, feed babies, hand it, hand it, milk my ladies."
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has raised online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, as many say it does not take the milk industry's "horror" seriously.
"Very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their own babies steal them a few days after giving birth," commented one.

Another commented: "Obviously traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast-feeding for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "An ad completely out of reality."
Others defended the ad, while one woman admitted that her song seemed "heartbreaking".
"I think it's a very clever idea.
I'd buy a breast pump like that if I were still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I didn't stop to overanalyze it.
It's a brilliant product," one wrote.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad that targets moms who draw breast milk (often in their workplace or toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
This is not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the milk industry."
At the end of the video the women's group reveals that they all danced with the distinctive breastplates tucked into their bras.
The rationale behind the hype is based on the idea that many women who pump breast milk with breast milk say they feel like cows.
The Elvie breast pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits inside a breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move, hold their babies and even go out during pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Executive Director at Mother, commented: "The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and challenging launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing women and dairy cows, we wanted to put breast milk pumping and all the challenges involved, showing at the same time in a fun and correlated way the incredible sense of freedom that the new breast pump will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's breast-feeding has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for fashion designer Marta Yakubovski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to camp on Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has skyrocketed, although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it harder to match children with maintenance workers.
Traditionally, most maintainers are migrants themselves without travel documents and are afraid to step forward and ask for a child and thus endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk intensified in June, when federal authorities announced that potential maintenance workers and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who applied to support unaccompanied minors.
Later the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had a white criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who are either dependents or members of the household of the dependents are in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albens.
Aiming to speed up the processing of children's cases, those responsible introduced new rules under which some of these children should appear before a court within a month of the start of their detention and not within 60 days, as was previously the case, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconferencing, in place of the face-to-face appearance, in order to develop their claims of granting legal status before the immigration judge.
Those found not to qualify for discharge will be immediately deported.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become stressed or distressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and with reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates said these concerns are intensifying in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where indications that a child is having difficulty are more likely not to be noticed, due to the size of the facilities.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving sufficient time to prepare children psychologically or say goodbye to their friends may exacerbate the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Mouallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the guise of fighting terrorism and "will receive appropriate treatment."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Mouallem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions more were uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight this holy battle until we expel all Syrian terrorists" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and inform both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of the war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Mualem said the conditions are good for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "dispersing irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay away from their country.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union warned that no aid will be given to rebuild Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a demilitarized zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity to advance political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented an extensive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Muallem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military actions would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be neutralized".
UN special envoy Stafan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Mouallem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited "to reviewing the articles of the current Constitution" and warned that no interference should be made.
Why Trump will win a second term
With this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again, unless, as many liberal viewers possibly hope, the motion of censure and scandals prematurely end his presidency.
Something that would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic presidency finale of all time!"
So far there are no signs of spectator fatigue.
As of 2014, ratings in the high-view zone have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled, reaching 1.6 million on MSNBC.
The Fox News television network has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the high-view zone, while four years ago it had 1.7 million, according to Nielsen and MSNBC's show "The Rachel Maddow Show" has scanned the ratings on satellite television, with 3.5 million viewers on evenings of important news.
It's a fire that people are attracted to because it's something we don't understand," said Neil Baer, producer of the ABC drama series "Designated Survivor" where a minister becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovel, a veteran comic book writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
He recalls a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
Her driver said she would vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked "why?"
"She answered 'Because it makes me laugh'" Mrs. Scovel told me.
One can have fun even with chaos.
Of course, unlike television series, scenarios coming out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy v. Wade case, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite and the health of the global economy.
Frequency change is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can enjoy.
And yet, you go beyond the definition of an informed citizen when you've been around for six hours watching a team of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "long interviews in the background" for his book "Fear" ("Fear"), Paul Manafort's $15,000-worth ostrich leather bomber "a garment full of insults", according to the Washington Post.
I, however, will never see Super Mario the same way again.
"What it does and that gives you the feeling of reality show is it gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the television program "Pawn Stars", about the ever-changing actors and the daily twists in the plot of Trump's performance (starts a fight with N.F.L., praises Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, otherwise you're left behind.
When I met with Mr. Flies this week, it was a sunny day at 26 degrees Celsius outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was booked in watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
It could not be undone, not when Brett Cavanaugh was to attend before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging by a thread.
"I remember doing those crazy shows back in the day and people were saying 'This is going to mean the beginning of the end of Western civilization'" Mr. Fleisch told me.
"I thought it was some joke, but it turns out they were right after all."

Foreign money pours into the most marginal showdown for midterm elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania constituency in Congress accepts a flow of money, thanks to the realignment of congressional constituencies, which put two sitting members of Congress candidates for the same position.
This newly redesigned Pittsburgh suburban district is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who was elected to another district in special elections held last spring.
Lamb opposes another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who represents the former 12th constituency of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th constituency.
The maps were redesigned following a decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that ruled in January that the old districts were being manipulated unconstitutionally for the benefit of Republicans.
The election in the new 17th constituency sparked a campaign of financial competition between the largest party funding segments, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after achieving a marginal victory in a special election held in March, for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional constituency, which was attended by many people.
This position was held by Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political analysts give Democrats a light lead.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but backed away
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, prompting mild reactions from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and kept a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to recall American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the agency's spokesperson, said earlier this month.
But the imposition of sanctions against El Salvador alone, estimated to have received about US$140 million as U.S. aid in 2017, was considered, including for drug controls, development, and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in economic aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country, with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, as a continuation of a corresponding gathering that took place last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent refugees from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, top management made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead, effectively ending the thoughts of imposing sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is due to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the great importance the gathering has for the administration, diplomats said.
All three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal consultations, on condition of anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Read History
The next blow may be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, for which very strong evidence has now been made public.
It is rumoured that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation into the possibility of collusion between Mr. Trump's election campaign and Russia regarding the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable before that body, as he prepares to reclaim the presidency in the next election and perhaps eventually before a grand jury.
The "ifs" are many and I do not imply that the fall of Mr. Trump, nor his bonds in Europe, is inevitable.
There are choices we all have to make from both sides of the Atlantic that will judge the length of this battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unrestrained course of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
Americans are now faced with several of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man holding the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since it was written in that newspaper that last year he suggested that the president be secretly recorded and that he considered him unfit for the position of president.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the version adopted by the Times is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the F.B.I.'s recently requested inquiry into Brett Cavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite the well-founded charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But, because of the lesson I took in Thing, I think we won't fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovaka Jew who was transferred to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later he sent me to light Jewish Sabbath candles on that swastika table.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the battle with Rapid Vienna
Rangers greets Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month, will give her a good chance of qualifying from the 7th Europa League Group.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season until his 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard for greater successes.
"It was a good time for us because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We got into the game believing we could accomplish something and came out with a point.
Maybe we could get away in the end, but, in general, the draw was a rather fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were a better team in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another big European night.
Well, well, we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they brought a good result in their last game, but, with people on the podium, I'm sure we can do our best and bring a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, due to my injuries and the changes made to the team itself, but there is a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids enjoy it, the training is good.
Hopefully we'll be able to do our best now, leave last season behind and succeed."
Women lose sleep because of their fear of retirement savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few discussed it with their family.
Nearly half of the Nationwide survey participants said they are discussing with their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they have spoken about this to their children.
"People want their family to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to have the conversation," said Holly Schneider, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Start with this.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care unless you express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care can include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance at a buyout price to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own property - as long as you have the money.
Draft your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make a proxy for health care issues to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that health professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider making a proxy for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person in order to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid, in case you become helpless.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an emergency health problem and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
List these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just economics, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Be sure to prepare this plan."
Man received multiple fire with air gun at Ilfracob
A man was fired multiple times with an air gun as he walked home last night.
The victim, aged about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon County, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm.
Police officers described the incident, which took place during 02:30 British Summer Time, as an "accidental event".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries he sustained are not life-threatening and police are appealing for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With communications interrupted, humanitarian aid forces have failed to obtain information from Dongala, an area north of Palu, located closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster broke out.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located on the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a regency that extends along more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) of coastline to the southwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, a tier of administrative division under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of the province of central Sulawesi and especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is most found in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Response Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Tsunami also struck western Dongala in 1996, causing the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia lies within the earthquake-prone Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is often hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest recent earthquakes and tsunamis are as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Acheh Province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, while more than half were in Acheh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late May and early April.
Hundreds dead on Nias Island, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake on the Richter scale centered near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale struck one of the Medawi Islands, near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed the lives of about 300 people.
2016: A low-focal earthquake struck the Pinti Jaya region in Acheh, causing destruction and panic, as it brought to the world memories of the devastation sown by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami was caused this time, but over 100 people were killed by buildings that fell.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lobok in Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's first-born son arrested for domestic violence
Trak Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice-president Sarah Palin was arrested for assault.
29-year-old Palin, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of a domestic violence complaint, and resistance against the authority, according to the report published Saturday by the police (Alaska State Troopers).
According to the police report, when a known woman attempted to call the police to report the crimes he allegedly committed, she grabbed the phone from her hands.
Palin is temporarily detained at the Mat-Su temporary detention shop, with a $500 bail, as reported on KTUU TV.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he stated "certainly, innocent" when asked, as reported by the network.
Palin faces charges of three category A misdemeanors, which means he may be given a prison sentence of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by one day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal prosecution has been brought against Palin.
In December 2017 he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been brought before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of complaint about the criminal offence of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon while in a drunken state.
His partner claimed he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016, when she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic anxiety disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks have been cut off, while the death toll is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Video has been circulating on social media since the devastating event.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a celebration on the beach in the town of Palu when the tsunami struck the shore.
Federal prosecutors seek rarely imposed death penalty for suspect of New York terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty to be imposed on Saiphoulo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that claimed the lives of eight people - a rare punishment that has been imposed on the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck from the Home Depot company to carry out an attack on a bike track along West Side Avenue in Lower Manhattan, drifting pedestrians and cyclists found on his way on October 31.
In order to justify sentencing to death, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "with intent" and inflicted heavy bodily harm "with intent," according to the death penalty intent statement, filed with the Court of the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges carry the death penalty, according to the document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury brought Saipov face to face with the 22-point indictment, which included eight counts of homicide in favor of a criminal organization, a tactic often applied by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and a charge of violence and the destruction of self-propelled vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation" prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried out the attack as "abominable, cruel and vile."
"Sayfoulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused anguish, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Anhelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Lore Decant, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferucci, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Panuko," as stated in the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Court of the South District of New York prosecuted a case that carries the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually given a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was imposed on a federal case in New York City was in 1953 on the spouses Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek national, appeared unrepentant in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt satisfied with his act, according to police.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos he saw on his cell phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to set up the ISIS flag in his hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges listed in the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public advocates representing Saypov, said they are "apparently disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the imposition of the death penalty instead of accepting the plea of guilt for life in prison with no possibility of parole will merely prolong the trauma caused by the events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to call for the death penalty.
Tory MP says YESGEL FARATZ should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the popular army" today during a protest rally at the Tory convention.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians had to "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's MPs said he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK "would have already come out" by now if Mr Farage was the Brexit minister in charge.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces in trying to reconcile her deeply divided MPs was underscored by the fact that advocates of staying in the EU Toris participated in a separate protest rally against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep the Chequers compromise plan under control amid attacks by Brexit advocates, advocates of staying in the EU and the EU.
The allies insisted that she go ahead with her attempt to reach a deal with Brussels, despite reactions and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave protest rally in Solihull that he wanted to fly "the Chequers plan".
He said that Mr Farage should have been granted a title of nobility and given powers to negotiate with Brussels.
"If we were in charge, we'd already be gone now," he said.
The Congressman from Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit but we have to throw away the Chequers plan."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to become vassals.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bone rejected claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The assumption that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is completely untrue."
Brexit advocate Tory MP Andrea Jenkins was also at the protest and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan does not have the acceptance of the general public, the Opposition is not going to vote for it, it does not have the acceptance of our party and our activists who are taking to the streets and in the end electing us.
Please leave the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a sharp message to Mrs May, he added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage told the protest rally that politicians should be forced to "feel the pressure" if they are prepared to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"There is now a question of trust between us - the people - and the class of our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to say to them 'we won't let you get away with it if you do that.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the class of our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
"We are moving the people's army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, advocates of staying in the EU demonstrated in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Few activists waved Tories anti- Brexit banners after the group gathered this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives because of the security issues they faced with a party implementation at the opening of the conference.
"It's the same people who tell us that they can put the information systems and all the technological means needed for the EU-Canada Type Agreement with enrichment, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute fiasco.
It doesn't mean a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future plans during a gathering at a western Massachusetts town hall on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, claims her re-election in November, against Republican state spokesman Jeff Deal, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is strongly speculated that he can face Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters making use of city hall structures since Trump's tenure began.
A rally attender asked her if she plans to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it's time "to go to Washington women to build our broken government and that means a woman has to be at the top."
Arrest for deadly shooting of LSU basketball player Simms
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Diton Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11pm (Eastern Time Zone).
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man seen in the video.
20-year-old Simms was fatally shot near Southern University site early Friday.
"Wade Simms suffered a bullet wound to the head, which led to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to the 247sports web site.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene with a gun in his possession and confessed to shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any resistance and is detained in the Police Department of the East Baton Rouge district.
Third-year student Simms with a height of 1.98, who grew up in Baton Rouge played 32 games, with 10 appearances as a starting player last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton goes for world title, as his team's instructions gave the hand the victory over Sebastian Fettel
It became clear from the moment Walteri Botas passed in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play an important role in the race.
At the starting point Botas had a good start and almost hung Hamilton, as he defended his position in the first two turns and called on Fetel to attack his counterpart.
Fettel went first in the pits and let Hamilton run in the race queue, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the pits a lap after and came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton came forward after a wheel-to-wheel battle, forcing the Ferrari driver to reluctantly abandon the interior due to danger of falling into the double-move violation to defend the third corner.
Max Ferstappen started in last place and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then remained first for much of the race, as he held his tires aiming to finish quickly and pass in front of Kimi Rykonen in fourth place.
He eventually went into the pits in the 44th round, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, as Rykonen came fourth.
It's a tough day because Walteri was fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did great and did the one-two," Hamilton said.
Body language was very bad
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasy Ford's letter, in which he accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a gathering in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that the events in the Senate proved that people are "evil and vile and liars."
"The one thing that could happen and this beautiful thing that's been happening in the last few days in the Senate, where you see anger, you see people who are angry and ill-intentioned and miserable and liars," he said.
"When you see posts and leaks and then they say to you, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you make the leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a minute.
If we leaked...No, we didn't leak," he added in imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received Ford's letter containing details about the charges against Cavanaugh in July and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak was from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported in the Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to keep her classified and I kept her classified as she asked me to."
But her refusal did not seem to convince the president particularly, who commented during Saturday's rally: "I'll tell you something, the body language was very bad.
He may not have, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused by three women of sexual harassment, the president hinted that Democrats are using the charges to serve their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power using any means necessary.
You see the malice, the misery, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to take power and control," the president said according to the news website Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars took an atonement for her defeat in the Friday Elite League match against Belfast Giants, winning the 5-3 rematch at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an easy lead with two goals with a shot by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boveyer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan County drew the draw for the hosts before Dwyer reinstated the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee and then two goals by Lucas Ludwald Nielsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League in the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came with a 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants having taken the victory in the previous three games.
Dwyer opened the score in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFall's assist, while David Rutherford gave the assist thanks to which Bovier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In an action-packed opening season, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Markward gave the assist for the equalization by Cooney at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the lead for the Giants in the first half when he scored his second goal for the night towards the end of the first quarter.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard tied again with a power demonstration goal at 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match towards the end of the second quarter and he secured the victory with his team's fifth goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Giants, who have now lost in four of their last five matches play at home with Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller loses his life to save hundreds of plane passengers from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is declared a hero, as he lost his life in his attempt to ensure the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing due to a major earthquake that struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many have been trapped in rubble in the city of Palu.
However, even though his colleagues ran to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonios Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the tower of control that moved furiously, at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed in position to make sure Batik Air Flight 6321, located on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower when he believed he was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Siret said this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian television network ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are shocked at his death," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the dead could be thousands, while the country's disaster response agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Shigi and Butong is limited.
"The death toll is believed to increase further, as many bodies are still under rubble, while many of them have not been able to reach them," said agency spokesman Sutopo Puruo Nugroho.
Waves reaching six meters destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass burial ceremony on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Riza Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute some ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jean Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to save survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work night and night to carry out any work related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" broadcast CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lobok, which cost the lives of more than 550 people.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after crashing an aircraft in a lake
The airline flying that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports one man missing, while earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini in a press release stated that as of Saturday afternoon she is unable to find the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and the condition of all of them was stable.
The causes of the collision and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon outside the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane passed the runway.
US passenger Bill Janes said the plane went down too low.
"That's extremely good," said Janes.
Janes said that he and others managed to move through the water that reached them halfway to the emergency escape exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants had panicked and shouted and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that some sailors working nearby to improve a dock also helped rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the ship sank to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in airline crashes registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of these conflicts involved Air Niugini.
Analyst cites the timeline of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its argument Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
She explained to the jury how she used cell phone records to line up the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location records from various cell phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his earlier claims, as reported by the Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified as a witness on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said "he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records showed that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is due to begin its defense on Sunday.
The judge said he estimates that later that day the trial will be put to the jury's judgment.

A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre, filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has escaped its roots, which were political messages and dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as Fugees and Common experience a recent recovery in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man? !
Nanny in New York sues couple who fired her after receiving "racist" message
A New York nanny sues a couple for racist dismissal after receiving a message accidentally sent to her by the mother where the latter complained that the nanny was "another black man."
The couple denies being racist, likening the lawsuit to "blackmail".
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when she realized that the new nanny Giselle Morris was black, as soon as the latter appeared for her first day at work in 2016.
"NOBODY ELSE BLACK" wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris and even twice.
Upon realizing her blunder, the now awkward Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done no good work and was expecting a Filipino woman in her place, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for her one and only day's work and was then sent home with Uber.
Now, Mrs. Morris has brought a lawsuit against the couple seeking compensation for the dismissal and claiming compensation of $350 a day for the six-month term of work as an in-house nanny, for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple refute claims to be racist, saying it was reasonable to fire Morris, as they feared they could not trust her again after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had offended, even if by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Likening the lawsuit to "blackmail," Plasco said that his wife had only given birth two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Would you go after someone who is in this situation?
It's not that kind," the investment banker added.
While the legal case is ongoing, the public opinion court hastened to convict the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would show no interest in a talking teddy bear, a new letter reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to get in the shoes of someone who was reading it for the first time before its publication.
It's a lot of fun when you know what we know now about Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book from a stuffed teddy bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweet-sweet", as her father left life last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family," she added that her father was secretly proud of his later success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn't arrogant," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real in his eyes, it was almost like having a child who accomplishes something: you're proud of it even if it's not your own achievement in reality.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Even though it was a creation of his own and his imagination, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad kept calling and telling me it was too bad, that he didn't have much hope of making it," Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz said.
"At one point Nad called me to tell me she was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tasi, I love you very much, darling.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive were slowly diminishing and coming out of her system.
He had already died some time before and at that time and now it was all gone.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing this was happening.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay calm."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who has hitherto mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, unaware of the ordeal she was going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"I had my head down and tears were running all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane I was possessed by a sense of compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women mourning the loss of their own faces hang cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang on a bridge in Wales cards with heartwarming messages and phone numbers that one can call to get support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a promising chef, with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him thanks to his smile.
They always said his smile lit the room."
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was "in a very bad state".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11, was the one who found his brother after he had put an end to his life.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried there's going to be an impact."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to inform the world that there are people out there that you can go and talk to, even if they are your friends.
Don't be silent - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her for 15 years companion, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt down or sad or anything like that," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He had hit bottom on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye."
He said that his death caused them a huge trauma, but they must overcome it: "It breaks up the family.
It's crushing us.
But we all have to keep going and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is uncertain, as FBI begins investigation
"I thought that if we could actually achieve something like what he was asking for - a research of limited duration and limited scope - maybe we could bring a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would break up amid entrenched party deadlocks.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the timing.
The midterm elections are in only five weeks, on November 6 and if, as expected, Republicans do not do well, they will be significantly weakened in their attempt to achieve the election of the person they wish to the highest court in the country.
George Walker Bush calls Senators, pushing them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is presented?
There will be a vote in the Senate, currently made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Mike Pence, the vice president, to get a majority and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors falls under Kim's authority
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from South Korea's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher charges on traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, that is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers apostates illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly deports them.
Relations between North and South Korea, typically still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the negotiations on denuclearization, which have been delayed.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms to work together to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday North Korean Foreign Minister Rim Jong Il blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances, under no circumstances will we disarm our country unilaterally first," Mr. Rim said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said he is temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman behaved this way, they would call her 'hysterical'," Pelosi commented regarding Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh, with intense emotion, denied accusations that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasy Ford when they were both teenagers.
At his opening address, Kavanaugh was deeply moved, sometimes almost shouting and his voice trembled as he spoke of his family and his school years.
He also unequivocally condemned Democrats in committee, describing the charges against him as a "monstrous and coordinated political character murder", organized by liberals who have been angry with Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he is biased against Democrats.
"I think he ruled himself out with these statements and the way he did against the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi reacted when asked if she would try to file a blame against Cavanaugh if his appointment was confirmed and if Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit not only for the Supreme Court, but for the court he's serving in right now," Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is a judge at the District Court of Appeals (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Roy v. Wade case, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm his appointment, Cavanaugh avoided answering questions as to whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Isn't it time for a hysterical, biased man to go to court and wait to say 'isn't that great?' said Pelosi.
And women should have it in their possession.
It's a justified outburst, months and years of rage overflowing and she can't get it out of her without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
He went on to say "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she too cried when she got angry, but she had developed a technique whereby when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to "You might think I'm upset because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And so he just kept going.
And it seemed excellent to me."
Tears are allowed as an outburst of rage in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most intense memories of a job I used to do, in an office dominated by men, is a time when I cried with unspeakable rage and was grabbed by the neck by an older woman - a cold manager whom I was always slightly afraid of - and pulled me up a ladder.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're outraged.
They think you're upset and they'll be happy because you've been broken."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic senator from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his campaign for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and left the race humiliated, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, thought there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for the presidency herself.
"It wasn't such a wise decision," he laughed at me, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another nomination.
Someone described the situation as "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign had already begun a long time ago, he was behind in funding and so vowed he would not enter the election race if he had not raised $2 million.
The battle was lost.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
In her speech in which she announced that she would not start an official campaign, she was very strongly charged with feelings - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of representatives and anger with sexism - that she felt knotted in the neck.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder about the press's reactions to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my headstone?
"Was she crying?"
How U.S.-China Trade War Can Be Good for Beijing Â· Global Voices
The salutations of the trade war between the US and China have been deafening and while the battle has much to end, a rift between the two countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing key Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The biggest escalation evolved this week, with new tariffs on items worth US$200 million (US$150 million), in effect with a tax on half of all products imported into the US from China.
Beijing is returning fire in kind every time, while recently imposing duties of five to ten percent on $60 million worth of goods.
China is determined to retaliate against American fire and the world's second-largest economy is not likely to put it down anytime soon.
In order to get Washington to back down it would have to give in to their demands, but publicly worshipping in the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
But, according to experts, if Beijing can play its cards right, American pressure in the context of the trade war could be positive for China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic collapse in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers have admitted in the past," said Abigail Grace, a research associate with a focus on Asia, at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria claims it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country's seven-year-old (and now) war-torn country.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al Mualem said that aid to rebuild the destroyed country is welcomed by the Syrian government.

Europe locks victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 at the Le Golf National golf course, outside Paris in France.
The American team has now been defeated 6 times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again took first place, as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. team star Phil Mikkelston, who fought hard during the longest duration of the tournament, threw his shot into the water in the par-3 16th hole, ceding the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone throughout his rounds and thus became 1 out of 4 players who scored 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spith was defeated at 5&4 by the European team's lowest ranked player, Danish Thorbjorn Olsen.
The world's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, scored 2 and 1 against Ian Puller from England, who may have played his last game in a Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran eight Ridder Cups, Sergio Garcia was crowned the most winning European of all time in the tournament with a total of 25.5 points.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a difficult year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy we got the cup back.
It's all for the team and I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said excitedly after the European victory.
He gives the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual game on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up admiring this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost in all four of his games in France and now has a career record in the Rider Cup 13-21-3.
Unusual stats for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and has been surpassed only by Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team had a difficult weekend to find a target, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Fino, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
American leader Jim Farrick spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought it.
At times this morning we put a lot of pressure on Europe.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, work with the U.S. PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 kids and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us."
