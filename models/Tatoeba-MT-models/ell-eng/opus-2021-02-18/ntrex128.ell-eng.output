Welsh MPs are worried they're gonna be confused with the 'mpets'.
Some Members expressed their concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern arose in relation to the plans to change the name of the House of Wales.
Members across the political spectrum are concerned that this will sound ridiculous.
One Labour MP said his party is concerned that "it will rhyme with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, the word "twp" means "stupid" and the word "pwp" means "circles".
A Plaid MP said that the whole party was "not satisfied" and proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said that his party was "open minded" about changing the name, but noted that the word MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the English pronunciation of Yorkshire of the letter u.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently drawing up the bill establishing the change of name, said: "The final decision on any name by which Members will be called will of course be a matter for Members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the House of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted for the designation of Parliament as the Parliament of Wales.
As far as the title of Members is concerned, the Commission has supported the name "Member of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMP", but it is the MWP option that received greater support during the public consultation.
Members obviously propose alternatives, but trying to reach a consensus can be a difficult case for Parliament's President, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill to change the name within the next few weeks.
The Law on Reforms will include other changes in the way Parliament operates, including rules for deducting from the Member's office and designing the committee system.
Members will decide in the final vote on the question of their names when discussing legislation.
Macedonians come to the polls for referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote Sunday on changing the country's name to "the Republic of North Macedonia".
The people's vote was sought in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens claims that the name of its northern neighbour conceals territorial aspirations and has repeatedly opposed its demands for EU and NATO membership.
Gjorge Ivanov, president of Macedonia, opposed to the referendum on changing the name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that change is simply the price they have to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silent as the churches in Harlem disappear
"The older people I spoke to say that there used to be a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today, there is neither."
He said he understands why the bars disappeared.
"The world is socialized in a different way today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the "salon" of the neighborhood where people frequent regularly."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling the assets will not last as long as the officials hope "and sooner or later they will return to where they started".
The churches, he added, may be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who will not be willing to help the places of worship left in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and will therefore speed up the day when all these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that all those people who move into these apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan community was built in 1870, St Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation left in the 1930 ’ s.
A congregation of blacks nearby took possession of the building.
The possession of St. Martin's building took over a black congregation under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted the 125th Street stores, a main shopping street in Harlem, which they refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson’s parishioners took over the reconstruction and ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's church, proudly called the carillon the bells of the poor.
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable instrument of historical importance".
The expert, Tiffany In, from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who was transferred to a larger carillon in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's church didn't replace him.
What has been happening to St. Martin in recent months is a complex story between architects and contractors, some of whom were hired by church folk leaders, and others by the diocese.
The commissioners - the parish administrative body, made up of popular leaders - sent to the diocese in July a letter concerning their concerns that the diocese "would seek to transfer the cost" to the college of commissioners, despite the fact that this had nothing to do with hiring architects and contractors sent by the church.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark attack on 13-year-old lobster dive in California
Shark attacked and injured 13-year-old boy on Saturday during lobster fishing diving in California on the first day of lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the cries of the child asking for help and approached rowing with a team to get it out of the water.
Hummel said that at first he thought it was just screams of excitement because he caught lobster, but then he realized he was yelling, "Something bit me!
Something bit me!"
His entire clavicle had been opened," Hamel observed when he arrived at the place where the boy was.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There is a shark in the sea!') Hamel added.
The boy was flown to Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical.
The type of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Lifeguard Larry Giles said in the press release that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim has severe injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Biss in Casablant to Swamis in Ensinita for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
The Sainsbury's plans put pressure on the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's compete with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams by placing cosmetic shelves corresponding to those of department stores, staffed with special employees.
In the context of the significant rise in the UK cosmetics market of £2.8 billion, which is still growing while the sales of clothing and household goods are falling, the largest cosmetic shelves will be put on trial in 11 stores across the country and spread to more stores if the project succeeds.
Investment in cosmetics comes as supermarkets search for a way to make up for the shelf space that once occupied televisions, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's said they would double the size of their cosmetics supply to 3,000 products, including companies like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also provide more shelf space with the company logo, similar to those of stores like Boots.
The supermarket is re-launching its own Boutique makeup series so that most products are vegan - something younger consumers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will try to dispose of its products in two Sainsbury's stores, the one opened in Croydon, South London last week and the other in Shelly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Electronic shopping and the tendency to buy small amounts of food daily at local mini markets means that supermarkets should make greater efforts to make people visit them.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said outlet stores will increasingly resemble department stores, as supermarket chains are trying to compete with Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more off-food services.
Sainsbury's put outlet Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and they also imported some Habitat as they bought both chains two years ago, which supported grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renovate the cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to distribute profits from drugstores to supermarkets in the chain.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 stores in Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, as opposed to 125 million pounds three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play its own role in the project, adding an extended range of luxury care companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our shelves in order to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained personnel who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our companies is designed to meet every need, while the attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a possible destination for cosmetics which challenges the traditional way of buying."
Peter Jones: Mad after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from the $11 million deal
The star of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, is furious after telecaster Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from the £11 million deal with her lifestyle business in order to devote herself to her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the clothing company and Truly accessories.
Their business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old presenter of this Morning announced on Instagram her decision to leave.
Holly Willoughby was furious at the star of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, leaving their profitable lifestyle business at the last minute in order to devote herself to her new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became furious when the gold TV girl admitted during a conference full of tensions Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that because of her new contracts - £1.5 million - she would no longer have enough time to spare the clothing and accessories company Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop company and appears to have doubled Willough's assets estimated at £11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoughby's announcement on Instagram that he's about to leave Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to some of his holiday homes.
According to one source: "Truly was far from Holly Willoughby's top priorities.
It was its long-term future, its source of revenue for the next decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved in the operation.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There is a warehouse full of products at the headquarters in Marlowe ready to be sold."
Experts estimate that the departure of the presenter of this Morning, which is among Britain's most commercial celebrities, could cost the company millions due to the huge investment in pillows and candles products to household clothes and clothing, as well as further delaying its presentation.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been in close friendship with Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
Couples spend their vacations together and Jones keeps a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV producer.
Willoughby is about to become the center of M&S campaigns and replace Ad McPartlin at the presentation of the "I'm A Celebrity" show on ITV.
A source from Jones' close environment said last night "We wouldn't want to comment on his business affairs."
We were tough, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he received from the media about a comment he might have made that some would have thought would be inappropriate to a president, as well as his so positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said in imitation of the telecast look.
"I didn't give anything away."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, after the original meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a big step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearisation have, however, been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ry Yong-ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the US after North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, he stressed, the US continues to apply sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trump kept a much more optimistic attitude in his speech.
"We are doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We almost had a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have built this extraordinary relationship."
He stated that his efforts to improve his relations with Kim yielded positive results - ending missile tests, releasing hostages and returning the rest of the American soldiers to their homes.
While supporting his unusual stance on statements about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a 'presidential' look, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the room because they couldn't get in, we'd only have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia sweep an entire island, leaving thousands dead in their wake
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was announced that foreign non-governmental organisations would not need assistance.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of Lobok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for the use of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they do not seek international assistance, so it is quite difficult," said Mrs. Subung.
While Save the Children is preparing a team that will travel to Palou, it is not yet certain whether the foreign staff will be able to work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the national disaster agency, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations would be allowed to contribute assistance.
Given the earthquakes that often hit Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared against the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Ace, this is not the case on other coastlines.
The obvious lack of a tsunami alarm siren in Palou, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
At best, the movement between the numerous Indonesian islands is difficult.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A floating hospital parked in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is heading for Palos, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of the new disaster.
President Joko Guidodo had at the heart of his electoral campaign the improvement of Indonesia's disorganized infrastructure and generously made money available for the construction of roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding plagues Mr. Joko's administration before the re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from persistent fanatic tendencies in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were displaced as groups of Christians and Muslims fight on the streets, using swords, bows and arrows, as well as other improvised weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturge is tied up against Chelsea
Daniel Sturge saved Liverpool from a loss at the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal at 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Steridge received a pass from Serdan Sakiri about 27 meters away from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball on his left and shot the back beam.
His effort was driven very high from the large area and ended up on the top right of the nets.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Aizabalaga who jumped to ward her off and went into the nets.
"I was trying to get this position, to get to the ball and players like Sakiri always play as far forward as possible, so I tried to earn as much time as possible," Steritz told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kade approaching, made a direct switch, didn't think about it much, and I shot the shot."
Chelsea had a 1-0 lead in half after the 25th minute goal by Belgian star Enden Azhar.
The blue quarterback passed the heel to Mateo Kovacic in this game, before giving a shot with a crank near the center of the field and running to the Liverpool side.
Kovacic did one or two in the center of the field.
Then he gave a deep ball, leading Azhar to the great area.
Azhar ran in front of the defender and completed by sending the ball into the net to the rear beam with a left shot in front of Allison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight against Naples in the Champions League phase at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Standio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3 p.m. Thursday in London.
The tragic account of tsunami deaths in Indonesia is 832
The account of deaths after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia is 832, according to the country's disaster agency's statements early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the wreckage of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 degrees earthquake that hit the area on Friday and created waves of 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Puruo Nugrojo said at a press conference.
The city of Palos, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the wreckage of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested 32-year-old suspect after murder of a woman with a knife.
A murder investigation started after a woman's body was discovered in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mousse on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
The police asked the residents who saw or heard something testify to the police.
Officer Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I would like to appeal to anyone in the vicinity around John Street and saw or heard something suspicious contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something in the dashcam cameras footage to contact us as they may have information in their possession that is vital to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a building.
This afternoon friends who believe they may know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about the location of her whereabouts this morning.
The investigations are under way as police said they are in the process of informing the next of kin.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mousse, in his attempt to return to his apartment, was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
Residents were informed that it may take hours before they were allowed to return home.
A police officer reportedly told a man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman showed up with tears on the stage.
He kept saying, "It's horrible."
At 2 p.m. two police vans were inside the police ribbon and one out.
Cops stood outside the ribbon and watched the building.
Anyone with any information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 for Case 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the last monument struck by the controversy over the "rewriting of history"
Its ostracism would be poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of numerous cultural and religious works in England by its fanatical Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Association described Mr. Creek's proposal as "foolish" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, stated: "In this debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable not to target Oliver Cromwell's form outside Westminster Palace.
The iconoclasm of England’s civil wars was not dictated or executed by Cromwell.
Possibly, the wrong member of the Cromwell family was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas' ancestor in the last century.
The excellent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornicroft is characteristic of his image in the 19th century and part of the historiography of a personality that many believe is worthy of tribute.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still viewed by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate matter is the subject of an open historical debate.
All that is certain is that the conflicts in the middle of the 17th century shaped the later development of our nation and Cromwell is a recognizable personality that represents one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also commendable and memorable."
Pig-murderer injures deadly Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in Southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, whose only last name "Wan" was disclosed, was found with a severed artery in a blood pool near a pigsty in the market of Lioupansoy in Guitsow Province, South China Morning Post announced Sunday.
A pig farm employee is preparing to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Kinhai Province, China.
He was allegedly traveling with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door of a neighboring pighouse open.
He stated that in the pigsty there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
The coroner's examination confirmed that the pig weighing 227 kg had fatally injured the farmer, according to his report.
"My cousin's feet were bloody and butchered," said cousin, known with his last name "W", according to the Guyang news newscast tonight.
Security footage shows Wan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Wan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news report that the pig was placed in a cage so that he wouldn't attack anyone else, while the police collected the evidence at the scene of the attack.
Wan’s family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating some compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of swine attacks on humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously hurting the man.
Ten years ago, a 200 - pound pig dropped a farmer in Wales on his tractor until the farmer’s wife scared the animal away.
After the incident in which a farmer from Oregon was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "start".
"They're just in a playful mood.
They're small, very strange creatures... they don't want to hurt.
We should just show them the proper respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains are going to bring extensive rainfall to the Southwest U.S.
According to predictions, hurricane Rosa wears off as it moves over the coldest water masses on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring flood rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Hurricane Rosa's winds peaked at 85 mph, becoming a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday and were spotted 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an area of low wind pressure has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and move east towards the West Coast of the United States. As Hurricane Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will bring tropical humidity north to the Southwest U.S.
Hurricane Rosa will bring rains of 25 cm [25 cm] in areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the area of low wind pressure approaching will create extensive heavy rainfall in the Southwest over the next few days.
Local rains of 2.5 to 10 cm [2.5 to 10 cm] will cause dangerous floods, debris flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will result in rainfall rates of between 5 and 7,5 cm per hour per place, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Rains 5 to 10 cm high are expected locally in the Southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapid deterioration of phenomena due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is recommended that you avoid any walking to the desert in view of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Strong rainfall can turn the canyons into rushing rivers and storms will cause local heavy winds and sand.
The low - pressure wind area will create some local heavy rainfall on the southern California coastline.
Total rainfall of more than 1 centimeter is possible, which can cause small debris flows and slipperyness in the streets.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical storms will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early morning hours on Monday, before phenomena spread late Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rainfall will spread in the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some intense temperature changes across the United States as temperatures in the Arctic fall, but in tropical zones they remain quite high.
At times, this leads to very intense temperature changes at nearby distances.
A typical example of intense temperature differences between the central United States was observed Sunday.
There was a difference of almost 10 points between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistently high summer temperatures will be observed and spread again.
In much of the Central and Eastern US, October is expected to begin with high temperatures at 27 °C from the Eastern plains to parts in the Southeast.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 °C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above average.
According to our long-term forecast for weather, temperatures above average in the East are likely to be observed by the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers attended Brett Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million viewers attended the US Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh's destabilizing testimony on Thursday and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blaise Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with television networks interrupting the normal course of last-minute overturning on Friday: the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake's agreement to conduct a week's investigation by the FBI in connection with the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that she is 100 percent sure that at a high school party Kavanaugh attacked her while drunk and attempted to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh, in a charged statement, said he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen's measurements, more than 20.4 million viewers were likely to attend the hearing on Friday.
The company calculated average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers did not immediately become available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
While Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate the number of viewers watching a broadcast from office premises.
Let's take a look at this ratings in its proper dimensions, it's an audience of similar size to the one watching a playoff football game or the Oscar Awards ceremony.
Fox News, whose journalists strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, preceded an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
In second place, is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
They followed CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2,52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake became a star in Friday's drama.
Following the Republican moderate's statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning protesters condemning him as he was trying to get into the elevator for the hearing by the Senate Justice Committee.
He stood looking low for several minutes as they disapproved of him, live on TV at CNN.
"I stand here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had made statements and, before the elevator doors closed, that he would have more to say at the Commission hearing.
All cable and transmission networks covered live a few hours later, the Senate Justice Committee's vote on promoting Kavanaugh's candidacy in the Senate plenary.
But Flake said he would only do it if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate next week, which was demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced after discussions with his friend, Democratic Party Senator Chris Kouch.
After discussions with Kush and some other senators then, Flake ruled.
Flake's choice was valid because it was obvious that the Republicans would not collect the votes for Cavanaugh's approval without an investigation.
President Trump has requested an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with Sunday Times.
Britain's Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with hers on the front page of the paper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson strongly criticises the Chekers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal to collect duties between Britain and the EU was "absolutely absurd".
Wade Simms Shot: Police Arrested Suspect Dieteon Simpson for Killing Player at LSU
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dieteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and is being held in prison on charges of second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge police station.
The authorities have in their hands a video of Simms' encounter with Simpson and according to the police Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Cops traced the glasses to the crime scene and reported trace of Simpson's DNA, according to the WAFB working with CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said they admitted he'd fatally injured Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report of East Baton Rouge coroner released on Friday, cause of death is gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Ministry made available to the Louisiana Police a special task force, the police forensic lab, the South University police forces and local citizens for assistance in the arrest investigation.
LSU sports director Joey Changeva thanked local law enforcement authorities for their "supervised investigation and the pursuit of justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The four - foot - tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "broken" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"We are always worried about incidents like this," Wade said.
Volcanic ash emissions in Mexico City
Volcanic ash emissions from the Popokatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital city.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicons Sunday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity in the crater reached its peak, with the recording of 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The Center was monitoring various readings and small seismic vibrations.
Images on social media show car windshields covered with thin layers of ash in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicians have noticed an increase in volcano activity located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 feet in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police forces clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a protest in favour of independence with the rehabilitation units, as thousands took part in the protests for the first anniversary of the vote on the secession of Catalonia that caused polarisation.
A group of masked pro-independence protestors held back by class rehabilitation units launched eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets usually flooded by tourists.
Conversations also occurred later during the day with police officers using their clubs to suppress the clashes.
For hours groups of supporters of Catalonia's independence shouted the slogan "We don't forgive, we don't forget" against groups of protestors in favour of the unity of the country who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated with minor injuries during the demonstrations, according to the local press.
Tensions remain high in the area that supports independence one year after the referendum of 1 October was declared illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
The vast majority of voters chose independence, although turnout was low with those against independence boycotting the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1000 people were injured last year, following police efforts to stop voting in polling stations in the area where violent clashes took place.
Groups for independence camped late Friday night to prevent a demonstration of support from the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different turn.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the pro-independence protests with his wife, said he no longer had hope for Catalonia's prospects of gaining independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our brightest moments.
I saw my parents with tears of joy that managed to vote, but now the situation is stagnant," he said.
Despite the fact that they achieved a victory of vital importance even though limited in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties fought to maintain their momentum this year, with many of their best known leaders being exiled or detained pending trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Pooch, a 42-year-old engineer, who recorded pro-police protests on his cell phone, said the clashes were fueled by politicians from both camps.
"The tension is escalating more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Zunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in custody last year, announced his candidacy at the European elections for next year.
"My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to denounce the suppression of democratic values and the oppression we have received from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonery: Arresting man after car crash in residence
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeated car crash at a residence in Londonderi.
The incident took place at Bolinagard Crescent on Thursday about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
There may have been a shooting in the car at some point.
Menga's hit gave Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
The advanced Livingston surprised the Rangers by giving Stephen Gerard just his second defeat at 18 games as manager of the Imbrox group.
Dolly Menga's hit made a difference as Gary Holt's side changed level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team remains without a win-off in the championship this season and faces the Harts, who have an eight-point lead next Sunday.
Prior to this match, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna at the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston in the meantime continues undefeated in six games in her category, with the main coach Holt not yet experiencing any defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is losing opportunities to visitors.
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before it scored, with its directness embarrassing the Rangers.
Scott Robinson took a lead and almost got there just before the finish, but Alan Lithgow repeled his effort by slipping Craig Halket's header away from the finish line.
The hosts willingly allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could push visitors into free strokes and cornering.
And that's how the important goal came.
The Rangers were unable to block a free strike, and Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to send the ball to Menga, who took the pass and scored from the center of the area.
Up to that point, the Rangers had dominated the ball's possession but found the defense of the hosts impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This figure continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos rejected the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was repeled from the legs of Rangers Allan McGregor's goalie and Stonegow's pass went out on another Livingston free throw.
Many vertical passes were made in the Livingston area and were constantly repeled, while two penalty sentences were requested - after claiming the ball from Halket against the substitute player Glen Middleton and one for hand - which were rejected.
"Excellent game" by Livingston - analysis
Alessder Lamont from the BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Spectacular performance and results for Livingston.
Everyone was exceptional, surpassing expectations in this ascending course.
Their game style and personality changed slightly after their return to top form, but the credit should also be given to Holt for the boost he gave the team upon his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Chief Halket was excellent, recruiting a highly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joey Warrell on the lookout throughout the game.
The Rangers didn't have any inspiration.
No matter how good they were in the past under Gerard's guidance, they didn't meet those standards.
Their last game was incomplete - only once managed to pass the defense of the hosts and this is a warning bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Mixed emotions in Erdogan's welcome in Cologne
The climate was good Saturday (September 29th) at the meeting of Turkish and German Heads of State for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed at restoring relations with NATO allies.
They had broken in relation to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
Police ruled out the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters managed to get close enough to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were of Kurdish origin - also gave the present, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The split of protesters reflects the controversial nature of a visitor treated by some Turkish-Germans as a hero and others as a dictator.
Car accident in Detfort: death of a cyclist after a car crash
A cyclist lost his life in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Detfort, southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance rescuers tried to help, but the man lost his life on the spot.
The conflict occurred a few months after a similar incident where a driver struck and left a cyclist, who lost his life on Childers’ Street, about 1.6 kilometers from Saturday’s accident.
Metropolitan Police said the authorities are making efforts to identify the man and inform their closest relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been diverted, while drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prisons: Six Cops Wounded in Controversies · Global Voices
Six police officers were injured in riots that broke out in high-security men's prisons, according to the prison director's statements.
Riots broke out in His Majesty's prisons in Long Lartin in Worcestershire at approximately 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still underway.
Special police forces "Tornado" have been called in to deal with the riots involving eight prisoners and they have been deployed in one wing.
Police officers were treated with minor facial injuries during the complications.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained personnel have undertaken to deal with the incident in His Majesty's prisons, Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated with trauma.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police authorities and may do more time."
In His Majesty's prisons there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June the prison administrator was hospitalized after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, the rehabilitation units were called to prison to suppress serious incidents that broke out, during which staff members were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (dried areas may benefit)
It is rare for a tropical recession to strike Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosa’s remains will cross the southwest parts of the desert, bringing floods to their passage.
The National Weather Service has already issued emergency flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass right over Phoenix on Tuesday, where he will arrive late Monday in rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have remained in a tropical storm or low barometric state less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the U.S. National Hurricane Centre predict a rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with individual rain volumes of up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rim, Arizona.
In other areas of the Southwestern States, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, there may be rainfall of between 1 and 2 inches, with a probability of single total rain volumes of up to 4 inches.
For areas not at risk from floods, the rain that Rosa brings can be a blessing, as the area is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious matter, part of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the Southwestern States are currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to US Dryness Observatory, more than 40 per cent of Arizona is facing at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought," weather.com said.
First, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Maintaining the hurricane’s intensity, on Sunday morning Rosa will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore be weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico with a tropical storm intensity this afternoon or Monday night.
There may be severe rainfall in areas of Mexico, which will cause a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall volumes of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, which may reach up to 10 inches," according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm now and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low barometric, then passing through Arizona to reach southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Hurricane Rosa or his remains is the very intense rainfall in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the southwestern states of the United States," the US National Hurricane Centre said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous heavy floods and streams of mud in the deserts and landslides in mountain lands.
Attack on Minchomer Norton: Four Arrests for Attempted Manslaughter · Global Voices
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested as suspected of attempted homicide after tracking down a 16-year-old who brought knife wounds to Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Beast area of Midsomer Norton, approximately 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, said Avon and Somerset police.
Cops appeal to anyone who may have recorded on a video on their cell phone what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh "lived the badness and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favour of Judge Cavanaugh is a vote to reject the merciless and infuriating tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "lived the badness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, categorically and with obvious emotion to Christine Blaise Ford's allegations that she was sexually assaulted decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified before a hearing about her allegations.
The President said Saturday that the "American people saw Kavanaugh's greatness, quality and courage" that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Cavanaugh's candidacy is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent public service course," he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's candidacy, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but it's actually like I am," he said.
"That's why I travel everywhere supporting excellent candidates."
Trump said the Democrats are on a "resistance and obstruction" mission.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place by Friday at the latest, a senior deputy to the Republican Party leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total number of victims is projected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were swept away by the gigantic waves that swept the coast, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulauese, Indonesia, the authorities said Sunday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of Palos on Friday, when waves six meters high hit land at nightfall, dragging many to death and destroying everything in their wake.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of 7.5 Richter.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run immediately, so he was hit by it," said Sutopo Purgu Nougroho, a representative of Indonesia's BNPB disaster response agency, in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it swept cars, wood, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled to the ocean at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palou.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster response agency show many damaged buildings and shops, bridges that have been twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in an announcement that the energy released from Friday’s huge earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geography, located at the end of a narrow, long bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugrojo described the damage as "extensive" and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
He said bodies of victims were found trapped under the wreckage of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugrojo said that the victims and damage may be larger along the 300km coastline north of Palos, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
Communication systems were "absolutely paralysed and there is no information" from Dongala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that his staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy and it can get even worse," he said.
Wide criticism was brought to the Agency on Saturday because it did not inform that tsunami had hit Palou, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, there's a man upstairs in a building screaming panic trying to warn people down the road to the tsunami coming.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, dragging homes and cars.
The Reuters agency was unable to verify the authenticity of the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout, which also interrupted communications in the wider area of Palos, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts by authorities.
The army began sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but displaced people still desperately need food and other essential necessities.
The city airport was reopened only to contribute to relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Windodo's visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday is scheduled.
Tsunami victims in Indonesia exceed 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organization from Dongala managed to reach the city of Palou safely, where the workers found refuge in accommodations of tarpaulins set up in the courtyard of their office, they went through disaster scenes along the way, Mr. Dosheba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of damaged houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some relief groups have undertaken the sad task of starting the relief process for those affected, some complain that foreigners, particularly experienced workers in the field of assistance, were not allowed to travel to Palos.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin if the place of a disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says it's a national disaster, we can call for international assistance, but there's no such decision yet."
As the second day passed in Palou after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing still hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the history of these natural disasters less bleak.
On Saturday, a little boy was recovered from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days, next to her mother’s dead body.
Gendon Subanton, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Maddagi, were his students.
"As an elder in the sport of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gedon told how, when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was released to the paratrooper community, he began to send desperate messages WhatsApp to his opponents in Palos who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, the sign next to his messages was a gray symbol "n", instead of two blues.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves got $26,750 when refueling an automatic withdrawal machine at Newport on Levy.
On Friday morning, thieves received $26,750 from a Brink employee who was refueling an ATM machine in Newport on the Levy, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had evacuated an ATM machine to the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Officer Dennis McCarthy said in the announcement.
While he was busy, another man "came running after Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects leaving the scene, according to the announcement, but the police did not determine the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identity should contact Newport police, calling 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Son
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Son.
Announcing the Twitter change on Saturday, he wrote: "The being officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been listening to caressing Yo and used this nickname as a title on his eighth album, released in June.
The change preceded his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album called Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande in the show, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Besides being an abbreviation of the professional name he uses today, West had previously stated that the word is of religious significance to him.
"I believe the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, which means "you," West said earlier this year, in a conversation about his album title with radio producer Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
My name changes from Kanye, which means "the only one", to Son, which is just a reflection of good, evil, our confused self, everything.
The album is probably a reflection of who we are."
He's one of several famous rappers who's changed their name.
Shin Cobbs is known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Didi or Didi, but this year he announced he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former partner of West, J.Z.I., is also pleased with the use of his name in or without dash and capital letters.
The elected President of Mexico swears he won't use the army against civilians
Mexican elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore he would never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression of students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelko Plaza Square that "he will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when left student movements were gaining roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. will have to double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in this area, states the investor and professional in the field of artificial intelligence Kai-fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment comes to be added to communications from various parts of the U.S. government on artificial intelligence, as the US does not overall have an official strategy on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China last year presented its plan to become the world's first country in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the research budget on artificial intelligence would be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are seeking to make the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Li said.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence taking place in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book entitled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The Super Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order) was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Managing Director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an artificial intelligence system that defeated the best American player Othello, while later he was an executive of Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee acknowledged the importance of previous US government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next visionaries would be held.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
"It is not China that gets the best of academic space, it is the companies," he said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired authorities from universities to work on artificial intelligence issues in recent years.
Lee argued that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that a green card should be automatically offered to PhD holders in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence Next Generation in July 2017.
China's National Institute of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations share money with American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is inferior, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, which will be joined by partners from the business and academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a Selective Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Science Foundation is currently investing more than $100 million annually in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made in US legislation for months with the aim of creating a National Security Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold referendum to decide whether to change country's name
The Macedonian people took part in a referendum Sunday to decide whether the country would be renamed the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that had blocked the country's candidacy to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, argues that the name of the northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether participation would reach the 50 per cent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was this: "You are in favour of joining NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece".
Proponents of change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to pursue accession to organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the country's future, so that Macedonian young people can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because so all of our lives will be safer," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, several members of parliament have said they will comply with the result of the vote, so that it becomes final.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, participation reached only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the latest parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters were present.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoraf Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Dusko voted in the referendum to change the country's name that would pave the way for the country's accession to NATO and the European Union in Macedonia's town of Strumika on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small tent and places chairs in front of tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads high, not as second-class partners," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the Eurasian union."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring coveted investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a positive result would be "confirming our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, the referendum would involve between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters, i.e. less than the required participation.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonia's television channel Telma TV, 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote positive.
For the referendum to be successful, participation must reach 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government, from its rise to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Awero passes Brighton's entire defense to score a goal
Sergio Awero and Rahim Sterling finished Brighton's defense by winning a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Awero seemed to score easily in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian striker took a pass in the middle of the stadium at the beginning of the phase.
He passed three Brighton defenders before he poured into the open space.
Then Awero was found surrounded by four green players.
He dribbled one defender, then escaping several others at the edge of Brighton’s large area.
Then he passed to his left, finding Sterling.
The English forward made his first move in the area by returning the ball to Awero, who used his right leg to defeat Brighton’s goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, scoring on the right side of the nets.
"Awero is facing some problems at his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said to play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial advantage in the battle of Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Awero got the ball deep in Brighton's area at this point.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball in his possession and guided Sterling to the rear beam.
The blue forward kicked the ball into the net just before it went out.
City faces Hoffenheim in the Champions League groups on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Ryne-Nekar Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Serzer wants to beat the Rockys.
As the Nationals were excluded from the playoffs, there was no reason to try to make another start.
But the always competitive Cerzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still consequences for the Rocques in the playoffs, as they lead by a Los Angeles Dodgers game in National League West.
The Rockies have gone to the playoffs with their 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to lock first place in their league.
"Although we have nothing to gain, at least we can play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will probably be a game of the highest level I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight a race like this?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who the original pitcher will be on Sunday, but they are said to be willing to let Cerzer throw the ball.
Serzer, who will do his 34th launch, did coaching on Thursday and will play on Sunday, which is normally a day of rest for him.
The right-handed Washington guy has an 18-7 performance with an average winning points (ERA) of 2,53 and 300 outs due to strike in 220 2/3 periods this season.
Trump gives a speech in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation regarding his selected Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, in a speech on the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important electoral procedures in our lives.
This is a very important moment; I am not a candidate, but in fact it is as if I am and, for this reason, I travel everywhere to support excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say: "You see this miserable, miserable radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to exterminate to get power and control, because what they want is power and control and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have undertaken a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you've been seeing this for the last four days," he said, describing the Democrats as "angry and bad, miserable and liars".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by naming Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, a report that was accepted with strong disapproval by the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you reveal the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, oh, no, I'm waiting for an answer, that was a really bad use of body language, the worst use of body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad party.
It is not tolerable to those who express their opinion
I was not surprised at the fact that activists of the Momentum movement in my local group voted to bring reproach on me.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour Members to whom they have said that they are not welcome, precisely because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, had a similar attitude because she resisted anti-Semitism decisively.
In my case, my motion of censure was criticized for arguing with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, paradoxically, for similar issues to those on which Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The invitation to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "we want our meetings to be productive with everyone's participation."
For most of the eight years I have been a local Labour Member, the meetings of the General Commission on Friday evening have been exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a 'more compassionate, more compassionate' policy has long been forgotten if it ever really started to come true.
It is increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I previously thought we had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and adopt views that I would never agree with, whether they were national security or the EU single market.
Every time I spoke in public, regardless of what I was really saying, I listened to a rave on social media, where people called for my rejection, rejected the centre's policy and told me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than other colleagues, as the comments addressed to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day, but never give in.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time in politics is how insults are now considered normality.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad party and that with every motion of censure or change in the rules of choice, the party's boundaries are narrow.
I've been advised many times over the last two years not to stand up, not to talk too much, and so "everything will be fine".
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party, 32 years ago, as a student still, because of the neglect shown by the Thatcher government which literally led to my entire class failing, my aim was to defend better public services for those who need them the most, either as a member of the local council or as a minister of the government.
I never hid my policy, and so did I in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused in any way about my political views and my points of disagreement with today's leadership.
To those who promoted the motion of censure on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country faces a Brexit that will hurt our households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I am loyal to the Labour Party leader.
But, really, my only message is not addressed to the members of the Momentum movement in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political expediency will prevent me from acting as I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Air - Melrose: 38 - 17: Unbeatable Air rises to the top
Two late goals may have twisted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ire deserved to triumph in this extremely entertaining match of the Tened Championship today.
It is now at the top of the ranking, the only undefeated group of ten.
Finally, it was her superior defense, as well as the best exploitation of opportunities, which set the scales in favor of the homeowners, and coach Peter Murchi had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Congratulations to Ire, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did."
The Grand Anderson goal in the 14th minute, converted by Frasier Clemo, brought Irene forward, but a yellow card to Scotsman Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggott scored a goal without conversion.
Clemo raised Ire's lead with a penalty, before he scored, right at halftime, a turning goal, leading Ire to the locker room with a 17-5 score.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's goal, converted into Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, who was removed by a stretcher, and, after the reboot, Ire further increased the difference with a goal by Stafford McDowal, converted by Clemo.
Deputy Chief Blair McPherson then took a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of Bruce Colvin's numerical advantage with no conversion, after a period of intense pressure.
The home team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow tackle card to Clemo without the ball, from the penalty line, McPherson scored a goal at the back of the attack that Ire launched.
Climate transformed, as it did again almost since the reboot, after Kylie Rowe picked up David Armstrong's kick and sent Extrem Gregor Henry away for the fifth home team goal.
Still Game star starts a new career in focus
The star of the Still Game Ford Kiernan series seems ready to jump into the catering industry after it has been revealed that he has been appointed director of an licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular show, which he writes and in which he co-stars with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hebfil.
The couple announced that the upcoming fifth cycle will be the last of the show and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Gaegland.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the information, even though a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to deal with the "growing branch of focus" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": The enclave Bolivia hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the fully equipped naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings there are blue flags.
On the bases of the navy from Lake Titicaka to the Amazon is written the slogan: "The sea belongs to us rightfully.
It's our duty to get her back."
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of Chile’s coastline after a bloody conflict over the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the longing of its people to travel to the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have now increased more than ever, for decades, as Bolivia has been awaiting the ruling of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has the dynamic, a spirit of unity and calmness, and naturally awaits the result with a positive look," said Roberto Calzadila, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the International Court's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that The Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim to force Chile, after decades of fickle talks, to negotiate for Bolivia to be granted a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous President, who is fighting a controversial battle for his re-election next year, has much to gain or lose from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia and that even if it did, not much would change.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the power to give thousands of territories and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice is only to be issued six months after the final arguments are presented suggests that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of further promoting Bolivia's goals, the past four years may have undermined them.
"The current Bolivian government has usurped the issue of access to the sea," Zarate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has exhausted all of Chile's remaining good moods, he argued.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veljet, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually rapid.
On Monday Bolivia will have "an excellent opportunity to launch a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility to "end 139-year-old disputes with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadila also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin American's most popular leaders, uses the issue of exiting the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never deny its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea declares there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his state will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the heads of the two states.
Ri made these comments while US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems ready to resume nuclear diplomacy that had reached a stagnation three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Young Eun.
Ri states that the view that the ongoing sanctions and the refusal of the US to declare the end of the Korean War will eventually force the North to "kneel" is a summer night dream.
Washington hesitates to agree to issue the relevant declaration if Pyongyang does not first make significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism as to whether Pyongyang is seriously considering denouncing an arsenal that the country probably considers as the only means to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in oversized hats that will soon be available in a shop near you
If you want to raise your hat collection or completely avoid the sun, then stop looking.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented on the runway a series of bizarre supersized hats for their collection Spring-Summer 2019 which stole the show at Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely uncomfortable hats flooded the Instagram this summer and their designers sent their impressive creations to the runway.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was an oversized beige hat decorated with a wide bouncy with wings that completely covered the head of the models.
Among other supersized accessories were presented watermelons decorated with gems, a magician’s hat, even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and referred more to Hannibal Lecter than to high - sewing fashions.
One creation brought to mind complete snorkeling equipment and glasses, while another looked like melted ice cream in a cone.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with the huge accessories, you're lucky.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could reach central shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats made their appearance very quickly after La Bomba, the straw hat with the very wide one we've seen wear so many, from Riana to Emily Ratajkovski.
The popular brand that created the extremely uncomfortable hat that flooded social media sent another great creation to the runway, a straw beach bag almost as big as the model that carries it in its bathing suit.
The dark orange shelf bag, decorated with shelving rings and a white leather handle, was the piece that stood out from Jacquemus' La Riviera Spring-Summer 2019 collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage said in FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and large beach bags in the shopping malls next summer, as the designer made such a great sense that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills Are Necessary For People of the World · Global Voices
The independent schools of Scotland have a history of academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with yet another series of excellent results in the exams, which were only further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of service to their students and parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and higher levels of education, the career they will choose and their position as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a school curriculum on demand, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable choice lesson in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you're talking to someone in a language he understands, then what you're saying gets into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say comes into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot simply rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's exams, we find that languages are at the top of the scoreboards, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign - language students achieved a degree of A.
Data gathered from 74 schools of SCIS members showed that 72 percent of students achieved a degree of A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also had a grade A.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed for children and young people in the future.
Languages today, as a course of choice, are considered as important as courses related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A UK Employment and Skills Committee survey in 2014 revealed that, as regards the reasons why employers had difficulty filling job vacancies, 17 per cent involved a lack of language skills.
Therefore, the need to acquire language skills is becoming increasingly urgent so that young people are prepared for their future careers.
Since more future employment opportunities require language knowledge, these skills are necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future, because of this skill that you can use throughout your life.
If someone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over competition.
According to YouGov's survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, while French was the only language that spoke a two-digit percentage of respondents (15 percent).
For this reason, investing in language teaching today is important for today's children.
Knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child may be interested in, there will always be some languages to choose from in independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this area.
The independent schools of Scotland are loyally providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve, whatever the future holds for them.
One cannot deny today that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturalism and excellence for young people in Scotland.
They have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Waiting for the fans who are anxious to see LeBron make his first appearance with Los Angeles Lakers has almost come to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday at the first game before the game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been decided how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play for a few minutes.
After training a few days ago, James was asked about his plans for the six games the Lakers had to give before the season.
"I don't need preparation matches at this stage of my career to prepare myself," he said.
Trump's gathering in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of gatherings starting in Willing, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five scheduled gatherings next week, including tours to friendly adjacent areas, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote confirming his choice for the Supreme Court on hold, Trump seeks to boost popular support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting at Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET Tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's gathering in West Virginia online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to report at this week's hearings for the candidate for the Supreme Court seat, Brett Cavanaugh, who was held in a tense atmosphere due to allegations of sexual misconduct, with a vote of confirmation from the Senate that has been put on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigation is under way.
However, the primary objective of this series of gatherings is to help Republicans facing a two-way outcome in the November elections to gain some momentum.
Thus, the staff of President Trump's campaign said these five gatherings next week are aimed at "mobilising volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress's control is so crucial to his agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible, as we are on our way to the busy campaign period," he told Reuters a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who wanted to remain anonymous.
The planned gathering tonight at Willing's Wesbanco Arena could bring supporters from " Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the month Trump visits West Virginia, the state that won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrissey, a Republican candidate in West Virginia for the Senate, who is low in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come and try to give him a boost to the polls," Reuters quoted Simon Hender as a political scientist at the University of West Virginia as saying.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team has the courage to fight keeping hope alive as it moves to the singles on Sunday
After three one-sided games, Saturday afternoon fours might have been all this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented athletic idea, but players believe it deeply, and especially in such confrontations.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
"It was six points ahead and now four are ahead, so we probably have a little momentum," Jordan Spith said as he was leaving for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of leading four points and still remaining twelve in the game.
The Americans, as Spith says, feel the air on their sails and have much to encourage them, such as the twin Spith and Justin Thomas who played together all day long and each gained three points out of four.
Spith was deadly from tee to green, and he's setting an example.
The voices of the celebrations became louder as he continued his round, achieving a critical blow to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The hit they won on the 15th was accompanied by similar celebrations showing his conviction that the American team is not out.
"You have to look deep inside yourself and worry about your own game," Spith said.
It's what every player has left.
18 holes to make history.
The only players with more points than Spith and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable twin of Europe has achieved four out of four and it seems that it does nothing wrong.
"Mollywood" was the only twin that didn't hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but he also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nee on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way in which energy seems to flow to and from noisy spectators, seals the fact that they are the players that will have to win on Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory while the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both in different holes at the same time.
The debate on European glory remains premature.
Baba Watson and Webb Simpson put the glasses on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played with Alex Noren.
With a bogey and two doubles on the front Nine they shoved the Spaniard and the Swede so deep into a hole they couldn't get out of it.
But on Sunday, there won't be anyone to help you get out of your hole.
Fourball and foursome are so exciting matches to watch them closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant lead on the last day, but this foursome also showed that the US team has the guts, despite some doubts.
Europe takes 10-6 lead on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after its progress in fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with 10-6 against the US.
The inspired twin of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari ran two victories against a struggling Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead at Le Golf National so far at four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the missed American side in the morning fourballs, with a 3-1 streak.
The United States resisted the foursome more, winning two matches, but they were unable to catch up.
Jim Furik's side needs eight points out of Sunday's 12 single matches to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European emerging player to win four points in a row, while along with Molinari, also known as "Mollywood", after a shocking weekend it is only the second twin to win four points in the first four games in the history of Ryder Cup.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed at fourballs, they joined forces to defeat a tired Woods and American newcomer Bryson DeSabeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who crawled into Saturday’s two games, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 fourball and foursome and seven streaks.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning fourballs, returned to Henrik Stenson's teammate for the foursomes with 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka, winning first and third place in the world ranking.
Not everything went well for Europe, despite the pleasant, cool day southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas set the bar for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a difficult 2&1 win over John Ram and Ian Potter in Spain at fourballs and returned later to defeat Potter and Rory McElroy 4&3 at foursome while they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup a team was able to recover while losing four points in singles, although because he is the trophy player, Furik is enough to strike a tie to maintain the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday is out of their reach.
North Korea says it won't be disarmed unilaterally without confidence measures.
The Secretary of State of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions deepen the feeling of distrust towards the United States and that his country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho stated at the annual general meeting of the global organisation that North Korea had taken "significant steps of goodwill" in the past year, e.g. the cessation of nuclear and ballistic tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing facilities and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no way to unilaterally start our disarmament."
While Ri repeated known complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the possibility of a "staged" approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded as it progressed gradually in the process, his statement was important in that it did not completely rule out unilateral denuclearisation, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to the joint communiqué of Kim Young Eun and Donald Trump at the first summit to take place between an active US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim promised to work on "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first deliver its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls for relaxation of the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on becoming "first denuclearisation" and increasing pressure by threatening sanctions to achieve their goal by blackmailing, even putting obstacles in the "end of the war" declaration," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri made no mention of a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US chief pointed out to the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, however, pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the partner in the issue of denuclearisation were South Korea and not the US, denuclearizing the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the U.S. inland with North Korean ballistic missiles was inevitable because "Bad President" Trump called Kim a "missileman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who was threatening last year to destroy North Korea completely, praised Kim for his courage to move forward with disarmament measures, but said that much still needs to be done and that sanctions should remain in force until North Korea is denuclearised.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensively and continuously until full, final and confirmed denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously approved the sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to counteract the funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made to report him by North Korea a few hours later that he had "the demands of a gangster".
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile plant and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take "similar measures".
He made it clear that Kim told him that his "reciprocal measures" were security guarantees that Trump promised Singapore and promoted normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend classes on how to rest a lot
This year, a new course at Harvard University seeks all undergraduate students to sleep more in an effort to combat the growing culture of overnight study by consuming a lot of caffeine.
An academic discovered that students at the number one university worldwide often do not know basic things, e.g. how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chisler, Professor of Medical Sleep at Harvard Medical School and a qualified doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the lesson after a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I just hearing about this in my last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, which began for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as to improving general well-being.
Paul Bareira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to include the course when it was found that students were sleep deprived during the week to a significant extent.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is the image of a student dormitory, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books, to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn how long - term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not directly change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke," Professor Chisler added.
The culture of boasting because you studied all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Enough sleep, good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and stress, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of starvation, resulting in a lasting feeling of hunger.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physics biology, helped Professor Chisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said his lesson opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a lesson all over campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar program before starting their studies in this highly competitive educational institution.
Professor Chisler advised students to set up an alert for the time they should go to sleep, as well as an alarm clock for the waking hour, and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic monitors and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston - Rangers 1-0: Menga scores the men of Gerard
The Rangers suffered another sad defeat on the road, as Dolly Menga's shot led Stephen Gerard's distracted side to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Imbrox's team was looking to mark their first victory on the road since the February triumph with 4-1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerard's only second defeat in 18 games as a coach, leaving the team eight points behind Harts, who is top in the Ladbrokes championship ranking.
Menga struck seven minutes before halftime and the uninspiring Ranger roster seemed unable to retaliate.
While Rangers is now falling into sixth place, Livingston is rising to third, with just one goal difference from Hibernian leading.
And Rangers may be expecting more trouble, as supervisor Callum Spence had to receive first aid for head injury caused by an object thrown off the platform.
Gerard made eight changes to the team's composition and defeated Eyre in the semifinals for the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same lineup "Livy 11" that got a grade from Harts last week and would be happy with how this well-oiled machine of his was able to stifle all the opponents' efforts.
Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did more with the ball.
It should have scored in the second minute, when Menga's first long pass sent Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's territory, but the average didn't find the ball.
A deep free shot of Keegan Jacobs found Chief Craig Halket, but his quarterback, teammate Alan Lithgow, all he could do was send the ball away from the beam.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in the game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have won a penalty in 15 minutes, as he clashed with Stephen Lowless, but referee Stephen Thompson ignored Colombian's complaints.
Rangers only had two shots in the area in the first half, but Imbrox's former goalie, Liam Kelly, wasn't worried at all by Lasana Kulibali's headshot and Ovi Ejaria's subdued shot.
Although in the first 34 minutes of the race Livy was clearly below expectations, no one can deny that she deserved the victory for the effort alone.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball on to Scott Robinson, who kept calm and found Menga who simply completed the effort.
Gerard made half-time changes by taking out Kulibali and putting Ryan Kent, and the switch paid off almost immediately, as the extrem was passing the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to lure guests into the style of the game that she knows and enjoys, with Stonegow and Halket pulling away one far ball after another.
Holt's side could have increased the difference towards the end, but McGregor faced Jacobs straight up, stopping him before Stonegoo tried from the corner.
Rangers' alternate, Glenn Middleton, had another phase for a shootout towards the end, as he collided with Jacobs, but still Thompson ignored it.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Meter
A page from the almanac Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882: today, 136 years ago and VALE ... the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, and this invention eventually led to the device that is now known as the Geiger counter.
Pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has passed into the sphere of pop culture, as in the 1950 movie Bells of Coronado, starring the amazing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you hear the action of the atoms caused by radiation on the metal elements."
Evans: "Look, he's acting crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention bearing its name continues its work.
New anticancer vaccine teaches the immune to "see" problematic cells
New anticancer vaccine teaches the immune to "see" problematic cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune to recognize problematic cells in the context of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immunocells from the patient and their modification to the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein that is common in various types of cancer and then re-inject them.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize problematic cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immunocells from the patient, their modification in the laboratory so as to "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then the reinfusion of cells.
Professor Jay Berzovski, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine in our hands."
As Professor Berzovski explained, HER2 protein "is the driving force for the development of several types of cancer", such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung and colon cancer.
A similar approach in which immune cells are exported from patients and then "taught" how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West defended Trump, wearing a hat with the slogan MAGA, after his appearance on the SNL.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was disavowed at the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an awkward interview in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After presenting his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a baseball cap with the slogan Make America Great Again (To make America great again), he gave a raving recital against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talk to a white man and he says, "But how do you like Trump?
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL opened with a sketch starring Matt Damon, with the Hollywood star mocking Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee about Christine Blazi Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's delirious video went up on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to mock West with this post.
Also, West complained to the public that he wasn't treated well backstage because of his hat.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't come out with the hat."
They bullied me!
And they say I don't know what's happening to me," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "I don't know what's going on with me, and I'm going to wear Superman's cape, because that way nobody can tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments were rejected at least twice by the public and the SNL contributors seemed to be in a difficult position, Variety said, with one person saying in the magazine: "The entire studio was silenced dead".
West was called to replace last minute singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper McMulley, had passed away a few days earlier.
West confused a lot of people when he sang I Love It dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by Candace Turner, head of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for resisting the mob."
However, the host of the show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just himself, and that's great.
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or by supporting their "art") who I believe embraces and utters ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the being previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Didi.
The rapper Snoop Dog had changed his name to Snoop Lyon and of course the legend of Prince music had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.
Charge of attempted murder of a knife attack at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old was charged with attempted murder following a knife attack on a man in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident happened in Balihakamore, according to the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the D.A.'s office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for the role of swordsman John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
However, the 31 - year - old actor criticizes the stereotype of a bunch of heroes, saying that such roles on the screen pass on to young boys the message that they must be tough to earn respect.
Speaking in The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said "something is wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity can be combated in #MeToo's time.
Kit, who recently married his co-star at the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted to having a "strong view" on the subject.
"Personally, now, I believe it very much. "What did we do wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, regarding the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic virility because of the masculine characters it promotes.
He continued: "What is inherent and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they must display such behavior in order to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time.
Clearly something has gone wrong with our young people."
In the interview he also admitted that he does not intend to play in any prequel or sequel of Game of Thrones, after the end of the series next summer, saying "end of battles and horses".
Since November, Kit will star in the revival of Sam Shepard's True West project, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that his acquaintance with his wife Rose is the best he ever got from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in a row, so she somehow gave me my future family and my life from now on," she said.
Rose played Ygrit, John Snow's love repellant, the character that Kit plays in the Emmy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new incidents
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health services.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of them, new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, signaling a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spread rapidly to certain parts of China due to transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had almost zeroed, as Chinese health officials had stated at a conference in Yunan province.
However, compared to last year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains a common phenomenon.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sexual intercourse with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to anti-HIV medicines in an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies an executive leaked data from Republican senators, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
This Saturday, US Representative Maxine Waters denied claims that a member of her staff posted personal information from three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmaker.
The Los Angeles Democratic MP argued that the allegations were promoted by commentators and websites of the "far right".
" Liars, lies and even more horrible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Published information is reported to include home addresses and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and appears to have been published by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill environment during a hearing of the Senate committee on allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Brett Cavanaugh Supreme Court.
The leak occurred at some point after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and published the details of a member of Waters personnel, The Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely untrue and grossly false," Waters continued.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been violated because of these fraudulent and false allegations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and grossly false."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Flacer.
"This denial is full of anger, Flasser wrote.
"This shows that he doesn't have the courage to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be cheeky.
He mustn't question the motives of whoever blames him.
He must be calm and serene."
Flasser seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by his critics of being very angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to dethron Waters in the mid-term elections, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's real," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false allegations".
"We will do everything to find those responsible," he continued, "and answer for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to anyone and all my staff."
Review of the film Johnny English strikes again - a subdued spy movie with Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for brands of Brexit in every new British film and this seems to be true in this revival of the action-comedy franchise with a hero Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back in 2011 with Johnny English: The Return.
Can this humorous self-satisfaction about how obviously we're a mess to make the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the impotent Johnny English with his big eyes has been able to renew his license to screw it up for the second time, and his name says it's a broader comic creation designed for non-English-speaking movie viewers.
It is of course the clumsy secret agent who, while pretending to have the glamour and manners of an undercover agent, brings a little to Clouseau, with a dose of "Mr. Bean" and something from the guy who played a single note on the music theme of the film The Roads of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is also based on the traveler and international mystery man that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's most forgotten TV ads, wreaking chaos in his wake.
There are one or two good times in this last J.E. movie.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propellers hit his helmet.
Atkinson shows his talent for comedy, however, humor is quite subdued and strangely extravagant, especially when "serious" cinematic franchises such as 007 and Dangerous Mission now include quite comical elements.
Humor seems to be aimed at children and not adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's crazy setbacks are not as inventive and relevant as Atkinson's silent cinema sketches about Bean's face.
The eternal central issue is that Great Britain has a serious problem.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret spy network, putting out the identity of all of Britain's agents on mission, to the great disappointment of the agent on duty, played by Kevin Eldon in a sadly small role for his range.
It is the last drop for a pompous and ambitious prime minister who is on the verge of collapse because of political anti-popularity: Emma Thompson is doing the best she can with this character that reminds Teresa Mae, but the script is not very helpful.
Intelligence consultants inform her that, as every active spy has been revealed, she should bring back a decommissioned man.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as director of some classy school, but gives unofficial lessons for secret agents: here are some nice scenes, as English offers a type-A Spy Academy.
English returns to Whitehall for urgent briefing and reunites with Buff's former and fallen partner, who Ben Miller is playing again.
Buff is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role in which Vicky Pepperdin is not fully exploited.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the blunder for His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, meeting the beautiful and fateful Buletova benefit played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously fascinated by the charismatic billionaire technology that claims to be able to solve Britain's technological suffering: the threatening Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff are starting the odyssey of their farce: disguised as waiters, setting fire to a fancy French restaurant, causing chaos as they try to illegally board Volta’s luxury yacht, and English causes anarchy as he attempts to use a virtual reality device to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s home.
All the tricks are used in this last scene, but no matter how lovely and noisy it is, it still reminds a little bit of children's TV.
Moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I wonder: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he'll really do great work with his talent?
Workers deny they're considering a plan for the British to work four days, but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days' work.
The party reportedly seeks the bosses of the companies to channel the savings achieved through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers, giving them an additional free day.
Thus, employees will enjoy a three-day weekend without reducing their wages.
Sources say the idea goes hand in hand with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the balance in favour of the workers.
The change in a four-day week was approved by the Labour Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy change is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is an ambition aligned with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not considered by the party."
Shadow government secretary John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to develop his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the "unrepresentable directors" and "winners" in utilities.
The shadow government secretary's plans also mean that today's shareholders in water companies may not get their entire share back, as a potential Labour government could make "retentions" due to suspected irregularities.
It also confirmed the plans to place employees on company boards and to create mutual funds for participation, in order to give 10% of private sector companies to employees receiving annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are talking on the 60 Minutes show about whether the FBI investigation into Cavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question whether the agency's findings could affect some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Peley, correspondent for the 60 Minutes show, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could dig out anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said on my way to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him directly: "Did you do it?"
He was unmistakable, determined, categorical."
However, Graham's vote seems to be not going to change.
"I have decided on Brett Cavanaugh and it will take some explosive charge to change my mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blazi Ford.
"And whoever he's named can't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is Global Citizen Festival and how much has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a rich program and well-known stars, but also an equally impressive mission: the eradication of global poverty.
For the seventh year now, tens of thousands are expected to flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park as part of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of those actively fighting against it.
In order to secure a free ticket at the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), stakeholders had to complete a series of missions or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, calling or finding other essential ways to help raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while there are still 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of a reward with a free concert the right way to convince our fellow citizens to take action or is it just another case of so-called "climaxtivism", that is, when some people feel that they really make a difference by signing an electronic request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, promoting a number of different goals.
He says these actions helped world leaders announce commitments and policies that amount to more than $37 billion, which are going to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements as a result of these actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the secured funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and developers, who are committed to "helping children fully exploit their potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to eradicate malnutrition, having received over 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like yourself, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote to history," Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the public during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following over 5,000 actions calling on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project entitled The Power of Nutrition, aimed at 5 million women and children with dietary interventions.
Answering the question "What makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?" included in the frequent questions on the site,
a member of the Global Citizen community replied: "The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all major human rights movements and anti-Apartheid before us, we will succeed, because unitedly we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wikent, Sean Mendes, Cardie B and Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will perform at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Farnesh and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy to "exclusion" block Russia's energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can turn "if necessary" to its Navy in order to block the supply of Russian energy to markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke revealed, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where it attempts at invitation from the legitimate government, is a pretext for investigating new energy markets.
"I believe that the reasons why they are in the Middle East are that they want to sell energy, just as they do in eastern and southern Europe," he reportedly said.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with Russian activity.
"The United States has the potential, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, to exclude them, to ensure that Russian energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the attendees as part of an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group designated as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are essentially the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "a pain that knows only one trick", as it has an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made as Trump's administration has undertaken the task of strengthening exports of American liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, Trump's administration, including President Donald Trump himself, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project for Nord Stream 2 which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a "capturer" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a project with a budget of $11 billion, which is going to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s strong resistance to the work is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance provoked Germany's reaction, which stressed its commitment to the implementation of the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to abstain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would seriously consider declaring the presidency's candidacy after the mid-term elections.
At a meeting at the City Hall of Hollock, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she's considering the possibility.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our troubled government, and that's why they need a woman at the top," The Hill quoted him as saying.
"After 6 November, I will consider the possibility of a nomination for the presidency."
Warren criticised President Donald Trump during the meeting, saying he was "directing the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren didn't chew her words about Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote".
A poll published Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not believe that it should run for the presidency in 2020.
58% of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% were in favour of such a nomination.
The poll showed more support for a possible nomination by former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a possible nomination and 48% against.
Other popular names from Democrats discussed in connection with a possible 2020 nomination are former vice president Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would have decided officially by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentioned Trac Palin's Post-traumatic Stress Disorder at Donald Trump's rally.
Truck Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"With what my son has been going through since he returned, I can understand other families living with the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and the injuries our soldiers carry when they return home," he told the public in the context of a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "a bomb ready to explode" and said about her son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, come back tougher, come back wondering if there is respect for what soldiers, airmen and every other member of the army have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Washington, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and gun possession while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Washington police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new US policy that denies asylum to victims trying to escape gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the region submitted a report of amicus curiae Friday in Washington supporting an asylum seeker to challenge politics, NBC News said.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August has not been revealed.
She stated that her partner "and his violent gang members" abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
He was held in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come in the United States, as countries that have severe problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed the decision of 2014 taken by the Committee on Migration (BIA) and allowed undeclared immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Carl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"In accordance with federal law, all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application; such an obstacle violates this principle," according to the amicus curiae report.
Lawyers also claimed in the report that policy that refuses entry to immigrants harms the US economy, claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "are a necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to grant asylum to victims trying to escape domestic violence and gangs.
"The asylum is available for those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or intimidation due to race, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his statement on politics on June 11th.
The purpose of asylum was never to relieve all the problems (even the most serious) people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palou, as the number of dead doubled despite the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very intense," said 35-year-old mother Riza Kusuma, trying to relieve her fever baby at an evacuation center set up in the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulances bring in more bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Some residents attempted to return to their damaged homes and collect their belongings through the waters, trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale, were unable to meet the needs.
Some injured, such as Dui Harris, who suffered a fracture of the back and shoulder, remained outside the Palos Army Hospital, where first aid was given in the countryside because of the continuing strong aftershocks.
Tears flooded his eyes, telling how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the wreckage of the wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence prevailed.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "intimidating" with "propagandist ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a US daily in favor of mutual trade benefits between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread his propaganda.
US President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday in China Daily's paid-for insert that appeared in Des Moines Register, the most selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking involvement in Congress elections on November 6th, a charge China denies.
Trump's charge that Beijing attempted to get involved in the US elections marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to push China.
Although foreign governments are not prohibited from publishing advertisements to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an escalating trade war and have mutually imposed various duties on imports.
China's tariff reprisals at the beginning of the trade war were intended to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstadt, an US ambassador to China and a former governor with a long term mandate in Iowa, a state that is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, as Branstadt wrote in an opinion article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "is engaged in this kind of intimidation by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press".
"In the attempt to spread this propaganda, the government of China exploits the precious tradition of freedom of speech and free press in America, publishing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at Beijing stands, you will find few divergent voices and no true representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic course, given that the media are under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, although it did not reveal which one.
Republicans alienate female voters in the face of mid-term elections due to Kavanaugh's fiasco, analysts warn
As many top Republicans continue to defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh despite allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that there will be a reaction, especially from women, to the forthcoming mid-term elections.
Emotions on this issue are particularly tense and most Republicans have said they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be restored," Grand Reier, a professor of political science at Maxwell School in Syracuse University, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Reeer doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute move to ask the FBI for an investigation will be enough to attract angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and they are certainly not going to forget it in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national press representative of the progressive MoveOn group, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan "November is coming!" in the Senate corridor as Republicans who control the Judiciary gave the green light on Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazi Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will reach record levels," Stu Rodenberg, an undivided political analyst, said on the news site.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of indecisive female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29 who, while they dislike the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts predicted that there might be a reaction if Republicans proceed with the nomination.
"It's a huge mess for the Republican Party," NBC News quoted Michael Steele, a former president of the National Republican Commission as saying early last week.
"It's not just about the vote in committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put off. It's about how the Republicans handled the issue and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group that helps to elect the Democrats pointed out on a news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the statements of Fortn and Cavanaugh, slightly more in favor of the second.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of the respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35% said that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said he believed that Cavanaugh probably or certainly lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's move, the FBI undertook to investigate Ford's complaints and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh attacked her while he was drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals while they were at a party when they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new work of this technology legend is Inrupt, a company based on Berners Lee's open platform Solids.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored, as well as who will be able to access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "global domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses the technology of the Solid platform allowing users to create their own "personal electronic data repository" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, outstanding work lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and all that at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal electronic data storage site is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls this possibility "personal empowerment through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is that the company offers resources, procedures and appropriate skills so that Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company consists of Berners Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers who worked on the project and a community of volunteer code developers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lee said he and his team are not talking with "Face and Google about whether they are allowed to make radical changes, overturning business models overnight.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a post in Medium released on Saturday, Berners Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
Over the last few months, Berners Lee has been a strong voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the Internet," Berners Lee added.
Bernard Van: Clergy Tax for the Cross of Victoria in World War I
The only clergyman of the Anglican Church who has received the Cross of Victoria during World War I as a soldier was honored in his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van received the medal on September 29, 1918, for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
Saturday was the unveiling of a commemorative plaque by his two grandsons, accompanied by a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, stated that it was "extremely symbolic" that the unveiling of the plaque became exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act for which he received the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Van led his battalion to Saint-Kentin's Canal in the midst of a very dense fog and while he was under heavy fire from combat weapons and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the front line and with "excellent valor" led the line forward before hitting alone with a battle weapon three of the posse.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, stated that his grandfather's heroic actions were "something I know I could never reach, it's something that makes you feel unlimited respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also placed a wreath after the parade, led by the young Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he "feeled honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a genuine hero is proven by the support he has from many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, but they saw Peppa Piggy.
Consider this scenario: you have stayed up all night watching the exciting Bellator 206, but you are deprived of the pleasure of seeing this unique sporting event.
The program in San Jose included 13 matches, including six on the main card, and would be broadcast live in the United Kingdom, from Channel 5, in the night zone.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Musashi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to go into the ring, spectators in the United Kingdom stayed together when the show changed to Peppa the Pig.
Some were not happy at all, as they had stayed awake until the early morning hours especially for the race.
A Twitter fan described the children's program as "some kind of sick joke".
"According to the legislation, this content was not suitable for 6 a.m., so the children's program had to be viewed," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Piggy, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they were going to process the program to include UK viewers in the future.
"If we think about the replays, I think we can make it," Koker said.
"But it's six a.m. Sunday there and we won't be able to do it until Sunday, that's theirs on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the change happened, a lot of messages were exchanged back and forth and they weren't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't, it was because of the rules.
I promise you next time that's not gonna happen.
We'll narrow it down to five games instead of six, as we usually do, and we tried to offer more to the fans, and we went too far.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt "lower" because of his sexuality
The Olympic champion in diving, Tom Daly, said he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, but that prompted him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he hadn't figured out by high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking to the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, she said she supported homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said that since he became a parent, he's less interested in a victory at the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of the well - known radio show, was on sick leave for several months.
As a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "deficient" compared to the others when he grew up, because "it was not socially acceptable for both boys and girls to like."
He said: "Until today, these feelings of inferiority and diversity gave me the strength and the will to succeed."
He wanted to prove he was something, so he wouldn't let anyone down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic champion is a prominent defender of the LGBTQ community's rights and took advantage of his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to proceed with the decriminalization of homosexuality.
He said he decided to talk because he felt lucky that he could live openly, without consequences, and that he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion stated that "it was a surprise" when he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married Oscar Dustin Lance Black last year, who is 20 years older than him, but claimed that the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" (he participated for the first time in the Olympic Games at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it is difficult to find someone of an age who has similar good and bad times".
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Day, and Daley said he changed "his whole perspective".
"If you asked me last year, all I wanted was to win the gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than gold medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had gotten tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "Dad, you won't be around to sit in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and was dead I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew it was everything I dreamed of my whole life, fighting in the Olympic Games in my country, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song, Heather Small's Proud, which encouraged him in his preparation for the Olympic Games and still gives him the creeps.
Desert Island Discs broadcasts on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape Mikkelson will sit on the bench Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mikkelson will record a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th fight at Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his performance so he doesn't remember him for the wrong reasons.
Mikkelson, who participates for the 12th time (record number) in the games organised every two years, was forced by Chief Jim Furik to sit on the bench for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he does for the United States, the five-time winner shared the day to cheer up his game and to "work" in the hope of correcting his problematic points.
Without ever having been the most direct driver even at the height of his career, the game of the 48-year-old is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National stadium, where distant ones are often problematic.
And as if the challenge of the field wasn't enough, Mikkelson, in Sunday's ninth race, faces Francesco Molinari, champion of the British Open, who is working with the first-time Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, Mikkelson's game may be crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he plays today, hit me friendly in the back, put his hand around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furik said.
"He's very confident.
His name is at the Hall of Fame and he has offered a great deal to these groups, both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't count on him playing two games.
I was thinking more, but that's where we ended up, so we thought we should move on.
He wants to go out there like everybody else."
Mikkelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Sunday matches at Ryder Cup.
It could mean the end of a career at Ryder Cup that didn't reach its individual record.
Mikkelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furik said his presence had benefits for the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make jokes and he's excellent in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players were also having fun messing with him this week.
His contribution is not only in the game."
The leader of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the big lead may soon be lost.
Thomas Bjorn, the leader of the European team, knows from his experience that a big lead starting from last day's singles at Ryder Cup can easily be turned into defeat.
The Dane debuted in the 1997 Valderrama match, where a team led by Seve Balesteros managed to gain a five-point advantage over the Americans, but he barely managed to cross the final line with a difference of breasts, winning 141⁄2-11⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderama, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but barely," Biorn said in the picture, after watching the 2018 generation win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and all the members of the team that this is not over.
We're going all ready tomorrow to give it all away.
We're gonna go out there and play right.
Nothing's over until you see the grades on the board.
We have a goal to win this trophy, and that's where we focus.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we know very well that there are equally good players in the other team – the best in the world."
Satisfied with his players' performance on a difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I wouldn't be in a hurry to prejudge the outcome.
Tomorrow is another beast.
Individual performance counts tomorrow, and that's something different.
It's great to be on the field with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're out there on your own, then you're totally testing your golf skills.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, how to get the best out of them tomorrow.
You leave your teammate behind and he has to give it all up and show it his best."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furik from the opposing team will ask his players to perform better atomic performances than those they had with their teammates, excluding Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furik himself has experienced both ends of the last day's twists, as he belonged to the victorious team in Brookline before the unexpected defeat, as Europe performed its miracle.
"I remember every damn word he said," he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the leader in 1999, had assembled his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like Brookline, like in Medinah.
When we get that momentum, there's a lot of pressure in the middle games.
We decide our turn accordingly and play in the order that suits us, we will try to do our magic tomorrow."
Thomas is in charge of leading the game, and he's facing Rory McCilroy in the top game with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Potter, the rest of the Europeans in the top half of the series.
"I went with this team in this order because I think it covers the whole way," Bjorn said justifying his options for singles.
New postponement for Germany's new warship
The new frigate of the German Navy should have been put on duty in 2014 to replace the aged warships of the Cold War era, but it will not be received by at least the following year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, they report local media.
The entry into service of the frigate Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which invokes a representative of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems with tradition were decisive for the fate of the ambitious plan.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the oldest Bremen class frigates.
They will carry a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and missiles against ships, as well as some stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as it will be possible to use new frigates for up to two years outside German ports.
However, constant delays mean that although warships are considered state-of-the-art, which will allow Germany to show its power abroad, until they are finally put on duty, they will already be obsolete, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to pick up the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
Not much information has been made available about the reasons for the return, but the German media have reported a series of important "software and hardware defects" that would put the warship out of use if it were used on a combat mission.
The problems of the software were particularly important as Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have a crew of about 120 sailors, only half compared to the oldest Bremen class frigates.
It has also been revealed that the ship has much greater weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The frigate Rheinland-Pfalz of 7,000 tonnes is believed to have twice the weight of similar class ships used by Germans during World War II.
Apart from faulty equipment, the cost for the whole project (including crew training) was also an issue.
It is said to have reached a staggering EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), while the initial budget was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems that plague the new frigates are particularly important since Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy "will soon have no ships for missions".
The official said the problem swelled over time, because the old ships were decommissioned, but there were no other ships to replace them.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
National Trust eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
New research carried out on an estate in the Highlands, Scotland, seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting their food.
The findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to the planning of future actions to protect the environment.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will explore the habits of the common nano- bat and the small bat, as well as the brown bat and the dompenton myoctic in Inverewe Gardens, in Wester Ross.
Recorders will be placed in key locations around the estate to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile searches using handheld detectors.
Analysing the sound of all recordings by experts will determine the frequency of bat calls, as well as what species have this behavior.
A biotope map and a report will then be created to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, a natural environment protection consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of biotope management, such as the creation of meadows and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have fallen significantly since the last century.
They are threatened by building and development projects affecting the places where they roost and destroy their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting are also a danger, as are tape adhesives for flies and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their prey.
They're using an advanced sound-location technique to detect insects and obstacles in the course of their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, considers bats very important.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct regular investigations, inspect the places where bats roost and sometimes rescue them.
The organization has also created Scotland's first and only shelter exclusively for bats on the Threave estate, Damfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten species live.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, states that the estate is the perfect ground for bats.
"Here in Threeve we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many large trees and an ideal habitat.
There is still much we do not know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to increase their populations."
It emphasises that it is important to check for bats first before any maintenance work in dwellings, as the destruction of a single nest with small ones could kill up to 400 females and young, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Bats are protected species and it is forbidden to kill them, harass them, or disturb their privacy, or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a member of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer their help.
He said: "There's a lot left to learn about our bats and many of our species, we just don't know how their population is developing."
Ronaldo denies rape charges, as his lawyers are preparing to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape complaints against him as "fake news," saying some "want to project themselves" by taking advantage of his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
National Portugal and Juventus' attacker is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga in the room of a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
According to the complaint, he allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence and not mention anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers after the complaint, Ronaldo, 33, described the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is make news," said the five-time winner of the Golden Ball on camera.
"They want to project themselves and take advantage of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, but that's part of my job.
I am happy and all is well," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations he published, which they described as "an unacceptable report of rumors touching privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Skerts said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage in proportion to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting them at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player’s room, where she was allegedly raped by nature according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" by a "good guy," but he was betrayed by the other "one percent".
The documents say that Ronaldo admits that they had sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Majorga also claims to have gone to the police and to a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "fearing of retaliation" and worried about her "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she's trying to reverse the settlement, as she continues to suffer from post-traumatic syndrome due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of getting a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of alleged abuse, and this summer he switched to Italian Juventus by securing a 100m-euro deal.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will regret forever" the loss of motor vehicles
The United Kingdom "will regret forever", if it loses its reputation as world leader in the car industry after Brexit, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car industry stated that the impact of cross-border delays in the case of Brexit without an agreement could cost jobs.
The factory in Bernaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will be stopped at our factory," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's CEO in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has stated that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to risks in the supply chain according to car manufacturers in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line follows just-in-time. Spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars manufactured on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be problems at the border, resulting in delays and a lack of parts according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU "is specifically attempting to resolve the issue of cross-border controls".
"We need an agreement; we want the best possible agreement that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today 4.
"The elements that come not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers are that we need to ensure the continuity of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to tell how much plaid will stop production, however, warned that in the long term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsovalaris, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and is the union manager of Unite at the factory, said the union members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A representative of the government said: "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House announces.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may "be delayed another week", as the dispute continues over the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, the White House announced Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian intervention in the elections, Trump's assistants' connections with Russia, and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
The possibility of Trump firing the deputy attorney general, jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a wire in order to record his talks with Trump and to allow the president to be removed on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, last Monday he went to the White House amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he'd "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order not to coincide with the hearing before the Senate Judicial Affairs Committee in which both Cavanaugh and one of the women accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazi Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh within a week, thus delaying a vote by the Senate plenary.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press spokesman, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "There is not yet a date set, maybe this week, but perhaps another week will be postponed in view of all the other cases that the Supreme Court is considering.
But we'll see, after all, I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists have contradicted this claim: Sanders has had a press briefing in the White House since September 10th.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why this was happening.
Sanders replied that the limited frequency of the briefings was not due to a lack of "impression" moves by television journalists, although she said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are being displayed".
Then he implied that he would increase or directly communicate between Trump and the press.
"The President gives more interviews than any previous president," he said, adding without quoting evidence: "We looked at these numbers."
There will continue to be updates, Sanders said, but "if the press can direct questions to the President of the United States directly, this is incomparably better than talking to me.
We try to apply it often and you have seen that we have been doing it often in recent weeks and will take the place of press briefing where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with official visitors.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably proved why this is happening, with an unconventional and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled journalists.
Health Minister sends a letter to EU citizens working in the Scottish National Health System amid fears about Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU citizens working in the Scottish National Health System to express the country's gratitude and to wish them to remain after the UK has left the European Union.
Jean Freeman, a Scottish MP, sent a letter with less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applications for permanent residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Mrs Freeman wrote in her letter: "During the summer negotiations continued between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal and are heading for expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario of not reaching an agreement.
I know that this period must be particularly difficult for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every official regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Kristion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christyon Abercrombie was subjected to urgent surgery after a head injury in Saturday's race, where Tennessee State Tigers were defeated 31-27 by Vanderbilt Commodores, reported by newspaper journalist Tennessean, Mike Organ.
Tennessee State Rod Reed's main coach told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the counter and just collapsed there," Reid said.
The gymnasts and the medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the counter and then put him on a gurney and brought him back for further evaluation.
A member of the Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV television station in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was released from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is no "still evidence of the type/area of the injury" and the Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore under limited participation ("redshirt"), is in his first season at Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He took five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, reaching 18 tackles in total for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp fee for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp fee for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, while the extra money will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tories plans
The measure will counteract Corbin's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on buyers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will start applying a higher stamp fee to buy real estate in the United Kingdom, while the extra money will be used to help homeless people, as Theresa Mae will announce today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's campaign to attract young voters with promises of more economic housing and target the high-paid.
The increase in the stamp fee will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, while the additional funds will strengthen the government's campaign to combat housing shortages.
The increase, imposed on the current stamp fee, along with the highest tax rates introduced two years ago for buying second houses and lease houses, may amount to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to yield up to GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, leading to an increase in prices and making it more difficult for first-house buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy is introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the stamp fee so that more young people could acquire their first residence.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping property prices high, but acquiring land without using it and called on Mrs. May to abolish the roofs in financial housing in order to restore Britain's "roasting shame".
Mr. Corbin announced a series of impressive proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and a ban on evictions of 'insolvency'.
He also wants to give greater powers to the councils in order to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Perse I said I would devote my prime ministership to restoring the British dream - to improving life for every new generation.
And that means repairing the broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a life here.
However, it would not be right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and companies based abroad to buy homes as easily as hardworking British nationals.
For too many people the dream of home ownership has now become too far away and the indignity of housing shortage remains real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to coach the Scottish team"
The leader of Sandersland, Jack Ross, declares that "his ultimate ambition" is to become coach of Scotland's national team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is thrilled with the challenge of resurrecting the Northeastern England team, which is currently in third place in the 3rd League of Football of England (League One), three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer, after bringing St. Miren back to the Scottish Championship last season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I received a call for the second national team and that was it," Ross told the BBC, Scotland, on the Sportsound radio show.
"But I grew up watching Scotland's team in Hampden all the time with my dad as a kid, and that's something that's always pulled me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I succeed in training teams."
Among Ross' predecessors in Sandersland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paolo Di Canio.
Former Aloa Athletic coach says he did not feel awe when he was called upon to succeed such established names in such a large group, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this moment, success for me will be measured on the basis of the answer to the question "can I bring this team back to Premier League?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this group, it definitely belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy job to get her there, but I'll probably consider myself successful here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross started his career as a coach just three years ago, having spent a while as an assistant coach in Dabarton and a 15-month period on Harts training staff.
He then helped Aloa return from being demoted to the third category and led St. Miren from the brink of demoralization to winning the Championship next season.
Ross also says he's feeling more comfortable now than he's ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St. Miren and Hamilton Acantmical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he said, remembering the taking over of Aloa's coach.
"I really thought it suited me more to be a coach than a player.
It sounds weird because I was doing well, making decent money out of it, and I'd gotten pretty high.
But playing can be hard.
You have to endure a lot on a weekly basis.
I'm still having a hard time with work stress and stress, but the coach's job fits perfectly.
I've always wanted to train, and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than I've felt with myself in my entire adult life."

The best time for beer is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to research.
The summer heat boosted the profits for Britain’s tested pubs but brought greater pressure on restaurant chains.
The pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, from the consulting company CGA, which collected the data, said: "Continued sunshine and the largest of England's expected participation in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern to last month, in June, where pub profits increased by 2.8 percent, but restaurants suffered even more damage.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant revenues in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that serve alcohol have done far better, with the corresponding figures in previous years higher than the corresponding restaurant data have fallen.
The pubs serving food also suffered on sunny days, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In all managed pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while sales of food decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, from RSM's entertainment and hospitality analysts, said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and influence of important social or sports events remain the biggest factors in sales on the outside market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but the decline in sales by 4.8 percent annually will be particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have occurred at a worse time for business people in the focus area and time will tell whether the lower temperatures we experienced in August will give a much desired extension."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, rose to 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in trade name launches.

One out of five children keep secret accounts on social media, hidden from their parents
As the survey reveals, one in five children - even 11 years old - keep secret accounts on social media, hidden from their parents and teachers
Research on 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in false pages ("Fake Insta") on Instagram
This news heightened fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to show their parents
One out of five children - even only 11 years old - create accounts on social media, which they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to the Instagram photo notification website.
This news has intensified fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty per cent of the students said they maintain a healthy "main" account to show their parents, while keeping private accounts at the same time.
A mother who accidentally found the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, tracked down a teenage girl who urged others to rape her ("rap me").
The survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of School Managers and Directors (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted to keeping hidden accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online sites where their parents and teachers cannot locate them."
Eileen Doyle will be the "athlete voice" on the Scottish track council.
Elid Doyle was elected as non-executive advisor to the Scottish track board at the annual general meeting of the managing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most prized track athlete and President Ian Beatty commented on her election as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to take advantage of her wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eilind enjoys infinite respect for the entire Scottish, British and global track community and we are confident that the Scottish track will benefit enormously from its entry into the council," Beatty said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can actually contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the gold medal at 200 and 400 meters at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, having won four gold Olympic medals in total and is now a regular commentator at the BBC, was paralyzed after a transient ischemic stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time will tell whether or not I'll recover.
It was exhausting, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thanks for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising a suckler who compares mothers to cows divides online public opinion
A suckling company has divided online public opinion with an advertisement comparing mothers who suckle them with cows that milk them.
In order to launch the so-called "worldly first silent and wearing breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released a humorous advertisement inspired by video clips to highlight the freedom offered to breast-feeding mothers by the new breast-feeder.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled cow barn, with a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tails" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't masts, they're my boobs."
The choir continues: "Pick it, pump it, feed babies, pump it, pump it, milk my ladies."
However, advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, has raised an online debate.
With 77,000 screenings and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, as many say it does not take the milk industry's "freak" seriously.
"Very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their own babies are stolen a few days after birth," someone commented.

Someone else commented: "Standingly traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast-feeding for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "An advertisement completely out of context."
Others defended advertising, while one woman admitted that her song seemed "heavenly".
"I think it's a very clever idea.
I'd buy such a breast if I were still breast-feeding.
The pumping made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I didn't get to over-analyze it.
It's a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad that targets mothers who pump breast milk (often in their workplace or toilets) and feels like "cows".
It is not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women’s group reveals that they all danced with the distinctive breast-feeders tucked into their bras.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who pump breast milk say they feel like cows.
The Elvie suckler, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes and fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move, to keep their babies and even to go out during pumping.
Anna Balarin, partner and creative executive director in Mother, commented: "The Elvie breast-feeder is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a bold and challenging launch.
By making a parallel between breast-feeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to put at the heart of breast milk extraction and all the challenges it involves, while showing in a fun and related way the incredible sense of freedom that the new breast will bring.
This isn't the first time the Elvie breast-feed has been made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for fashion designer Marta Yakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in custody has skyrocketed, although the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it more difficult to match children with dependants.
Traditionally, most dependants are themselves immigrants without travel documents and are afraid to step forward and ask for a child and thus endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk was intensified in June when the federal authorities announced that potential dependants and other adult members of their household would have to hand out fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, senior immigration and customs officer, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to support unaccompanied minors.
Later the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are either dependants or members of the household of the dependants are in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," said Mr Albens.
Aiming at the quickest handling of children's affairs, the officials introduced new rules according to which some of these children should appear before a court within one month of the start of their detention and not within 60 days, as was the case previously, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear by means of videoconferencing, in place of self-representation, in order to develop their claims for legal status before the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to qualify for discharge will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to be stressed or distressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to shelter workers and reports that have been released from the system in recent months.
Counsels said these concerns are intensified in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where indications that a child is having difficulty are more likely not to be noticed because of the size of the facilities.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving enough time to prepare children psychologically or to say goodbye to their friends can exacerbate the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "occupied forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al Mualem also invited Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the guise of fighting terrorism and "will receive proper treatment".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said at the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions of others have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to fight this sacred battle until we drive all Syrian terrorists away" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and inform both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground of the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said that conditions are good for their return and he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay away from their country.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given for the reconstruction of Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a demilitarised zone in the last major bulwark of the rebels in Idlib created an opportunity to promote political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented an extensive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military actions would target jihadists, including warriors from the Al-Qaeda-related Nusra Front, who "will be neutralized".
UN special envoy Stafan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new commission composed of government and opposition members to draw up a post-war Constitution for Syria and prepare the way for elections.
Mualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited "to the revision of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned that no interference should be made.
'Cause Trump's gonna win a second term.
With this logic, Mr Trump will win the 2020 elections again, unless, as many liberal spectators probably hope, the motion of censure and scandals prematurely end his presidency.
Which would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic presidency finale of all time!"
So far there are no signs of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, ratings in the high-view zone have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled, reaching 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the high-view zone, while four years ago it had 1.7 million, according to Nielsen and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast has scanned the ratings on satellite TV, with 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
It's a fire that people are attracted to because it's something we don't understand," said Neil Baer, producer of ABC's dramatic series "Designated Survivor" where a minister becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovel, a veteran comic series writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
He remembers a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 elections.
Her driver said she was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
He said, "Why?"
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovel.
One can even have fun with chaos.
Of course, contrary to what is happening with television series, scenarios coming out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy versus Wade case, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing frequency is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can enjoy.
And yet, you go beyond the definition of an informed citizen when you've been watching for six hours a team of experts discuss the use of "long interviews in the background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear" ("Fear"), Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of $15,000 ostrich leather ("a garment full of hubris", according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the colorful descriptions made by Stormy Daniels about Mr. Trump's anatomy.
Well, I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"What he does and gives you the feeling of the reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawn Stars TV program, about the constantly alternating actors and the daily twists in Trump's performance plot (starts a fight with N.F.L., praises Kim Young Eun).
You can't afford to miss an episode, or you stay behind.
When I met with Mr. Fleis this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees Celsius outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He couldn't get away with it, not when Brett Cavanaugh was about to appear before the Senate Judicial Affairs Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging by a thread.
"I remember doing those crazy shows back in the day and people were saying, "This is going to mean the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleis told me.
"I thought it was some joke, but it turns out they were right after all."

External money flows into the most marginal race for midterm elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania constituency in Congress receives a flow of money, thanks to the re-alignment of Congressional constituencies, which put two current members of Congress candidates for the same position.
This newly redesigned Pittsburgh suburban district is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who was elected to another district in special elections held last spring.
Lamb opposes another active representative, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who represents the former 12th Pennsylvania constituency, which largely coincides with the new 17th constituency.
The maps were redesigned following a ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January that the old regions were being manipulated unconstitutionally for the benefit of Republicans.
The election in the new 17th constituency sparked a financial competition campaign between the major financial sections of the parties, the Committee on Democratic Campaign for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a marginal victory in a special election match held in March for the 18th Pennsylvania constituency in Congress, attended by many people.
Republicans held this position for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political analysts give the Democrats a slight head start.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support for China, but backed off
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, causing mild reactions from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and kept a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Agency's administrative team.
State Department officials have decided to call off the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions no longer to recognise Taiwan," Heather Nouert, the agency's spokesman, said earlier this month.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received around USD 140 million as US aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country, with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, as a follow-up to a corresponding gathering held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent refugees from moving to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior managers made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead, effectively ending the thoughts of imposing sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is going to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, in an indication of the great importance of the concentration on administration, as the diplomats said.
All three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman Bolton refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal consultations, subject to anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Read History
The next blow may be the report by Special Advisor Robert Mueller on obstruction of justice from Mr Trump, for which very strong evidence has now been made public.
It is rumored that Mr Mueller is also turning his research into collusion between Mr Trump's election campaign and Russia in relation to the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to this body as he prepares to reclaim the presidency in the next election and perhaps finally before a grand jury.
Ifs are many and I do not imply that the fall of Mr Trump, nor his bonds in Europe, is inevitable.
There are choices that all of us must make on both sides of the Atlantic that will judge the duration of this battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler if the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the uncontrollable course of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been in trouble since he was written in that paper that last year he suggested that the president be secretly recorded and that he considered him unfit for the president's position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the version adopted by the Times is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the FBI's recently requested investigation into Brett Cavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite the legitimate charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will put Mr Trump in charge?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But, because of the lesson I took in Thing, I don't think we're gonna fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was transferred to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later he sent me to light Jewish Saturday candles at that swastika table.

Norman Eisen, senior executive at Brookings Institution, is the president of the Citizens for Response and Ethics in Washington and the author of the book "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House."
Graham Dorans of the Rangers is optimistic about the fight against Rapid Vienna.
Rangers welcomes Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning the Austrians, after the impressive tie in Spain with Villareal earlier this month, will give her a good chance of qualifying from the 7th Europa League Group.
A knee injury prevented average Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season until the 2-2 tie with the Villareal, but believes that Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger hits.
"It was a good time for us because Villareal is a good team," said 31-year-old.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and came out with a degree.
Perhaps we could get away in the end, but, in general, the tie was a rather fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we were a better team in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have produced a good result in their last game, but, with the world on the platform, I'm sure we can do our best and bring a positive result.
Last year has certainly been difficult because of my injuries and the changes that have taken place in the group itself, but there is a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids enjoy it, the training is good.
Let's hope we can do our best now, put our last season behind us and succeed."
Women lose their sleep because of their fear of pension savings
Although research participants had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few discussed it with their family.
Almost half of the participants in Nationwide's research said they are discussing with their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they have spoken about this to their children.
"People want their family to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to have the relevant conversation," said Holly Schneider, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance company.
Start with this.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these options may be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care can include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance at a redemption price to help you cover these expenses or self-security with your own property - as long as you have the money.
Draw up your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make a health care proxy to appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that health care professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the possibility of making a proxy for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make decisions on financial matters on your behalf and to ensure that your accounts are paid if you become helpless.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an emergency health problem and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Refer to these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just economics, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make sure you prepare this plan."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With communications cut off, humanitarian aid forces have failed to obtain information from Dongala, an area in the north of Palos, which is closer to the centre of the 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale.
In Palau more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster broke out.
Here are some important facts about Palou and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palau is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit it.
Dongala is a regency that extends more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) of coastline to the southwest of the Sulawesi island.
The regency, a tier of administrative division under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is most found in Morowali, across the Sulawesi coast.
Palu and Dongala have been struck by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit west Dongala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia lies within the earthquake ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is often plagued by earthquakes.
Some of the largest recent earthquakes and tsunamis are:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh, Indonesia, in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, while more than half were in Acech.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late May and early April.
Hundreds dead on Nia Island, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 degrees on the Richter scale hit the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing tsunamis that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 points on the Richter scale with a focus near the city of Pantang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 points on the Richter scale hit one of the Medaui Islands, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and cost the lives of about 300 people.
2016: Low focal depth earthquake hit the Pindy Jaya area in Accech, causing destruction and panic, as it brought to the world memories of the destruction sown by the deadly earthquake and the 2004 tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but over 100 people were killed by buildings that fell.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lompoc in Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's firstborn son was arrested for domestic violence
Truck Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaskan governor and candidate for vice presidency Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
29 - year - old Palin, from Washington, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect in domestic violence, obstructing a complaint of domestic violence and resistance against the authority, according to the report published on Saturday by the police (Alaska State Troopers).
According to the police report, when a woman known to him attempted to call the police to report the crimes he allegedly committed, he grabbed her phone from her hands.
Palin is temporarily detained at the Mat-Su temporary detention store, with a 500-dollar guarantee, as reported on the KTUU TV station.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he said "surely, innocent" when asked, the network reports.
Palin faces charges of three Class A misdemeanors, which means he can be sentenced to up to one year in prison and a $250,000 penalty.
He's also charged with a misdemeanor of class A, punishable by a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time we've been prosecuted against Palin.
In December 2017 he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been brought before the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of a complaint about the criminal offence of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
His partner claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016, when she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of Dead · Global Voices
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 - point earthquake on the Richter scale caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, while the number of dead is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake struck near the central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media has released videos from the moment of the catastrophic event.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palou Town when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are calling for the rarely imposed death penalty for the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty on Saiful Shaipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that has cost eight people their lives - a rare punishment that has been imposed on the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to attack a bicycle road along West Side Avenue in Lower Manhattan, dragging pedestrians and cyclists on their way on October 31st.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Shaipov killed the eight victims "with intent" and caused heavy bodily harm "with intent", according to the statement of intent to impose the death penalty, filed at the Court of Justice of the South District of New York.
Both of these charges carry the death penalty, according to the document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury brought Shaipov up against the 22-point indictment, including eight counts of homicide in favour of a criminal organization, a tactic often applied by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the attack as "abominable, cruel and vile."
"Saiful Habibulaevic Shaipof caused pain, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angeli, Nicholas Cleves, An-Laur Dekant, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferucci, Ernan Diego Mendossa and Alejandro Damian Panuko," as stated in the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the South District Court of New York has prosecuted a case involving the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but he was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed on a federal case in New York was in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg's husbands, who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Shaipov, a Uzbek national, seemed unrepentant in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he was satisfied with his action, according to the police.
Shaipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the ISIS video attack he saw on his cell phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to set up the ISIS flag in his hospital room, according to the police.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges filed in the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Shaipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" in the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to call for a death penalty instead of accepting a plea of guilt for life in prison with no chance of release will simply prolong the trauma caused by the events for all involved," Patton said.
Shaipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to call for the death penalty.

Conservative MP Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out" by now if Mr Farage were the Minister responsible for Brexit.
But the challenge Mrs May is facing in trying to reconcile her deeply divided MPs was highlighted by the fact that supporters of EU residence in Toris participated in a separate rally of protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep under control the Chekers compromise plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, advocates of EU and EU residence.
The allies insisted on moving forward with her efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the reactions and forcing Eurosceptics and Labourers to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave protest rally in Solihal that he wanted to fly "the Checkers Plan".
He said that he should have been given a title of courtesy to Mr Faraj and that he should have been given powers to negotiate with Brussels.
"If we were in charge, we'd be gone by now," he said.
The congressman from Wellingboro added: "I will support Brexit but we must throw away the Checkers plan."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to become vassals.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bone rejected the allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The assumption that the British people have changed their minds and wants to stay is completely untrue."
Brexit MP Toris Andrea Jenkins was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Checkers Plan does not have the broad public's acceptance, the Opposition will not vote for it, it does not have the acceptance of our party and our activists who go down the streets and then elect us.
Please leave the Checkers plan and start listening."
With a sharp message to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Faraj said at the protest rally that politicians should be forced to "feel pressure" if they are prepared to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"There is now a question of trust between us - the people - and the order of our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "we won't let you get away with this."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the class of our politicians, who are about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
"We are moving the people's army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of EU residence demonstrated in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the centre of the city.
Few activists were waving Tories banners against Brexit after the group gathered this weekend.
The Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives because of the security issues they faced with an implementation of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"It is the same people who tell us that they can put in place the information systems and all the technological means they need for the EU-Canada Agreement with enrichment, for the unimpeded borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute fiasco.
It doesn't mean good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts Democratic senator spoke of her future plans during a meeting at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, claims her re-election in November, against Republican State Representative Jeff Dill, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is strongly believed that he can compete with Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event was her 36th meeting with voters using city hall structures since Trump began his term.
A conventioner asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to build our broken government, and that means a woman has to be at the top."
Arrest for the deadly shooting of the LSU Simms basketball player
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the deadly shooting of LSU basketball player Wade Simms on Friday.
Baton Rouge police station announced the arrest of Deaton Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11pm (East Time Zone).
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man who appeared on the video.
20-year-old Simms was shot fatally near the Southern University site early Friday.
"Wade Simms suffered a gunshot wound to his head, leading to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to the 247sports network.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene with a gun in his possession and confessed to shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without any resistance and is being held in the East Baton Rouge District Police Department.
The third-year student Simms, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, with 10 appearances as the main player last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton goes for a world title, as his team's instructions gave him victory over Sebastian Fetel
It became clear from the moment Waltery Botas passed in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
At the starting point, the Boot had a good start and almost hung Hamilton, as he defended his position at the first two turns and called on Fetel to attack his ombar.
Fetel went first to the pits and let Hamilton run in the tail of the race, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits one round later and came out behind Fetel, but Hamilton stepped forward after a wheel-wheel battle, which forced Ferrari's driver reluctantly to abandon the interior due to the risk of falling into the double motion violation to defend the third corner.
Max Ferstapen started last place and was seventh at the end of his first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he remained first for a large part of the race, as he held his tires aiming to finish quickly and pass ahead of Kimi Rykonen in fourth place.
He finally went to the pits in the 44th round, but he couldn't increase his speed to the remaining eight rounds, as Rykonen came in fourth.
It's been a long day because Waltery was fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team did great and did one or two," Hamilton said.
The body language was very bad
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting Saturday for her insistence that Christine Blazi Ford's letter, in which he accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault, was not leaked.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judicial Affairs Committee, commenting instead that what happened in the Senate proved that people are "bad-willed and miserable and liars."
"The only thing that could happen and this beautiful thing that's been happening in the last few days in the Senate, where you see anger, you see people who are angry and mean and miserable and liars," he said.
"When you see papers and leaks and then they tell you, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document-- "oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a minute.
If we leaked... No, we didn't leak," he added in imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received Ford's letter containing details of the charges against Cavanaugh in July and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak was made by her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported in the Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to keep her classified and I kept her classified as she asked."
But her refusal did not seem to convince the president, who commented during Saturday's meeting: "I'll tell you something, the body language was very bad.
He may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was charged with sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges to serve their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power using any necessary means.
You see the maliciousness, the misery, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample on to get power and control," the president said according to the Mediaite news site.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars has been atone for her defeat in the Friday game at Elite League by Belfast Giants, winning the 5-3 rematch at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an easy lead with two goals with a shot by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauviyer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney brought the home team tie before Dwyer reinstated the Giants' lead.
François Bouchard tied up for Dundee and then two goals from Lucas Ludwig Nielsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third defeat in Elite Lig in the season for Adam Kif's men, who came with a 2-1 victory over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning in the previous three games.
Dwyer opened the score in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFoll's assists, while David Rutherford gave the assist thanks to which Boviier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In an opening period full of action, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Markward gave the assist for Kawny's equalization in 15:16.
Dwyer secured the lead for the Giants in the first half when he scored his second goal for the night towards the end of the first quarter.
The home team was regrouped, and Bouchard tied up again with a power demonstration goal at 27:37.
Kauni and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give the lead to Dundee for the first time in the race towards the end of the second quarter and he secured victory with his team’s fifth goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Giants, who have now lost in four of their last five games, play in their home court with Milton Kanes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller loses his life to save hundreds of plane passengers from an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is declared a hero, as he lost his life trying to secure the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing because of a major earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many have been trapped in ruins in the city of Palou.
However, although his colleagues ran to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonios Gunawan Agung refused to give up his position at the control tower that was raging, at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palos.
He remained in his position to make sure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Syrett said this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, as Australian television network ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are shocked at his death," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the dead may be thousands, while the country's disaster response agency reports that access to Dongala, Shigi, and Butong is limited.
"The number of dead is believed to increase further, as many bodies are still under ruins, while many of them we have not been able to reach," said service spokesman Sutopo Purguo Nugrojo.
Waves that reached six meters destroyed Palu, which will perform a mass burial ceremony Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Rizza Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini markets are looted everywhere."
Jean Gelfant, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to save survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's army: "I ask you to work day and night to carry out any evacuation-related work.
Are you ready?" broadcast CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lompoc, which cost more than 550 people their lives.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has been missing since the plane crashed into a lake
The airline flying that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports a man missing, while earlier it said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini in a press release said that since Saturday afternoon she has not been able to find the traces of a male passenger.
The airline said he was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to track down the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at the airport of Chuk Island.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all of them were stable.
The causes of the conflict and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed on the lagoon outside the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane went too low.
"That's extremely good," Janes said.
Janes said that he and others were able to move through the water reaching them halfway to the escape exits of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and shouting and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that some sailors working nearby to improve a dock also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to the shore before sinking the ship to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in air operations registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none of these conflicts involved Air Niugini.
Analyst quotes the timeline of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its speech Saturday at the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlet testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location records from various cell phones indicating that Telis was with Chambers the night of her death, disproving his previous claims, as reported by Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone the time she claimed to be with Michael Sanford's friend, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified as a witness on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Telis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said "he was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellys said he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records showed they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Tellys deleted Chambers' texts, phone calls, and contact details from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense is due to begin its speech on Sunday.
The judge said he estimates that later that day the trial will be brought to jury judgment.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the species, filling their music with positive messages.
High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has escaped its roots, which were political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make the conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common are experiencing a recent recovery in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man? !
Nanny in New York is suing a couple who fired her after receiving a racist message.
A New York nanny is suing a couple for racial dismissal after receiving a message that the mother accidentally sent her where the last one complained the nanny was "another black man."
The couple denies being racist, likening the lawsuit to blackmail.
Lindsay Plasko-Flaxman, mother of two children, was disappointed when she realized that the new nanny Giselle Morris was black, as soon as the last appeared for her first day at work in 2016.
"OLLIIIIII ANOTHER BLACK" wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
As soon as she realized her blunder, the awkward Ms. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done no good work and was waiting for a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for her one and only day of work and then was sent home with Uber.
Now, Mrs. Morris has filed an action against the couple seeking compensation for the dismissal and claims compensation of $350 a day for the six-month work as an internal nanny, for which she was originally hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple contradicts the claims that they are racist, saying it was reasonable to fire Morris, as they feared that they could not trust her again after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasko told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had offended, even by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Simultaneously treating with blackmail, Plasko said his wife had just given birth two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Would you go after someone who's in this condition?
It's not very polite," added the bank investor.
While the legal case is under way, the court of public opinion hastened to condemn the couple on social media, condemning them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would show no interest in a talking teddy bear, as revealed by a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the position of someone who read it for the first time before its publication.
It's a lot of fun knowing what we now know about Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book from a stuffed teddy bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweet child", as her father left life last year.
Regarding Paddington, who he describes as "a very important member of the family," he added that her father was secretly proud of his later success.
"He was a quiet enough man and he wasn't arrogant," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real in his eyes, it was almost like having a child accomplishing something: you're proud of it even if it's not really your accomplishment.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nand kept calling and telling me it was very bad, that he didn't have much chance of making it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"Sometime Nad called me to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive were slowly diminishing and coming out of her system.
He had already died a little while before and at that time and now it's all gone.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing this was all happening.
I couldn't scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay calm."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who so far mourns the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who ignored her ordeal.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"I had my head down and tears were running all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I got a sense of compassion for Nant.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women who mourn the loss of their own faces hang cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang on a Welsh bridge cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers that can be dialed to get support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when she began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," he said.
The 45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile lit up the room."
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was "in a very bad state".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had ended his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried there's gonna be an impact."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people out there who you can go and talk to, even if they're your friends.
Don't stay silent - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, has lost Mark, her 15-year partner, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling down or upset or something," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He'd hit rock bottom on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents, he wouldn't look them in the eye."
He said his death caused them a huge trauma, but they have to get over it: "It's tearing the family apart.
It's crushing us.
But we must all go on and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is uncertain, as the FBI is starting an investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually achieve something like what he was asking for - a limited and limited research - maybe we could bring some unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would be dissolved in the midst of consolidated party deadlocks.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on November 6th, and if, as expected, Republicans are not doing well, they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to achieve the election of the person they want in the country's highest court.
George Walker Bush calls senators, urging them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is presented?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Mike Pence, the vice president, to take the majority and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea falls under Kim's authority
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Young Eun came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Integration Ministry, said there were 1,127 distances last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher charges of traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea are eventually offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korea War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers apostates to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often expels them by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, typically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the negotiations on denuclearisation that have been delayed.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Young Eun in Singapore, where they agreed in broad terms to co-operate on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday North Korean Foreign Minister Rim Jong Il blamed US sanctions for its lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances, we will by no means disarm our country unilaterally first," said Mr. Rim in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical," says he's unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said it is by temperament inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman behaved in this way, they would call her "hysterical," Pelosi commented on Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Affairs Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with intense emotion, denied the charges of having committed sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blazi Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening address, Cavanaugh was deeply moved, at times almost shouting, and his voice trembled as he talked about his family and his school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the Democrats in the committee, describing the charges against him as "a monstrous and coordinated political murder of a character", organised by liberals who are angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as she showed himself prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he ruled himself out by these statements and by the way he succeeded against the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelozi reacted when asked whether she would try to file a complaint against Kavanaugh if his appointment was confirmed and if Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he's currently serving in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is a judge at the District Court of Columbia (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions on the Affordable Care Act or the Roy vs. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm his appointment, Cavanaugh avoided answering questions as to whether certain Supreme Court rulings would be overturned.
"Isn't it time for a hysterical, prejudiced man to go to court and wait for us to say "isn't it wonderful?" said Pelosi.
And women must have it in their possession.
It's a justified outburst, months and years of rage overflowing and she can't get it out of her system without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
He went on to say, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said she cried when she was angry, but she had developed a technique whereby when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
So he just kept going.
And it seemed extraordinary to me."
Tears are allowed as outbursts of anger partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of a job I used to do, in an office where men dominated, is one time I cried with unspeakable rage and was grabbed by the neck by an older woman - a cold director whom I was always slightly afraid of - and pulled me up a ladder.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset and they'll be happy to break it to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Senator from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an affair with an extramarital ship named Monkey Business (Damnwork) and left the struggle humiliated, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, thought there was no reason not to consider the idea of herself running for the presidency.
"It wasn't such a wise decision," he laughed at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another nomination.
Someone described the situation as "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign had already started a long time ago, he was back in funding, so he swore he wouldn't be in the election race if he hadn't raised $2 million.
The battle was lost.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men were only giving her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" he wondered.
In her speech in which she announced that she would not start an official campaign, she was very strongly charged with feelings - gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of representatives and anger with sexism - that felt knot in her throat.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalls about the guy's reactions to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
"He cried"?
How the US-China trade war can do good in Beijing
The salutations of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening and while the battle has much more to finish, a break between the two countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing basic Chinese exportable products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation has evolved this week, with new duties on items worth USD 200 million ( GBP 150 million), in fact with taxation of half of all products imported into the US from China.
Beijing returns fire in kind each time, and recently imposed duties of five to ten percent on goods worth $60m.
China is determined to return the American fire and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to give up soon.
In order to get Washington to back down, it would have to give in to their demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be extremely embarrassing for Shi Jinping, the president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing can play its cards right, American pressure in the trade war could be positive for China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic collapse in either of the two countries is in fact much more dangerous than observers have admitted before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia, at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is "ready" for refugee return, according to Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country destroyed by the seven-year (and over) war.
Speaking at the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al Mualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al Mualem said that aid to rebuild the destroyed country is welcomed by the Syrian government.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe locks victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the Ryder 2018 Cup, defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the Le Golf National golf course, outside Paris in France.
The American team has now been defeated six consecutive times on European soil and has won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its first place, as the team of Danish chief Thomas Bjorn reached 14 and a half points needed to defeat the United States.
US team star Phil Mikkelston, who fought hard during the tournament, threw his shot into the water at par-3 16th hole, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari flashed in all of his rounds and thus became one of the four players who achieved 5-0-0 since the start of today's tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spith was defeated at 5&4 by the lowest in the European team's rankings, Danish Thorbjorn Olsen.
The best ranking player in the world, Dustin Johnson, scored 2 and 1 against Ian Pulter from England, who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Sergio Garcia, was crowned the most victorious European of all time in the tournament with a total score of 25.5.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's all about the team and I'm glad I could help," Garcia said moved after the European victory.
He gives the baton to John Ram's compatriot, who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an atomic game on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up admiring this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a career record at the Ryder 13-21-3 Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and has only been surpassed by Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team has had a hard time finding a target all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finno, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
US Chief Jim Farik spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought it.
At times this morning we pushed Europe hard enough.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a big leader.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the US PGA and the Ryder Cup Commission and move forward.
I love those 12 kids, and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to face it.
They were better than us."
