We had no secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I have a green shirt.
You're a lot faster than me.
Tom now lives in Australia.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane.
Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow that.
Good morning.
Do you like juice?
You seem disappointed.
Tom knows all about them.
Did you sleep at all?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's right.
We laugh a lot.
Tell me what you get on the exam.
I think two languages aren't enough.
Could you lend me your car for tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter's a nurse.
I think we should talk.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to church by car.
You're a lot smarter than me.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write everything down.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's coming home at three.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I won't lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom teaches me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell them I'm innocent.
Raw fish is not my thing.
Sit down.
Do you have anyone?
He's a student of Jutsu High School.
You'll see.
I'm not satisfied with that.
They lost again.
Tom would do anything for you.
Is he okay?
What's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Could I find out where you work?
Can anyone explain it to me?
Who's that?
We have to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do this right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We painted the house green.
The time and place of the meeting are closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I've been promoted recently.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here.
Don't play here.
Please close the door.

What would you tell her to do?
He's kissing him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'll stop.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I fainted.
I wish I wasn't Canadian.
What shines is not gold.
I asked Tom to play guitar.
My phone's ringing.
He threw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist?
Tom's a head taller than me.
Where can we buy it?
Now it's 2:30.
Everyone knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was in his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadians.
Whose is this?

We're still in Boston.
Try it.
The phone's ringing.
Tom lives in Boston.
Thomas lives in a hippie commune.
The water's hot.
You need to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
It was urgent.
You're wearing expensive earrings.
Has anyone come?
Tom's the only Canadian here.
Tom will live.
It was too late.
These aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Canadian?
People today attach more importance to popular culture than to the past.
Tom's no longer my friend.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?

Did Tom see you?
We love each other.
I walk every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.

Do we have a guest?
I'll warn you.
I'll try to find them for you.
What's your name?
I'm unemployed, too.
Tom's house has been completely destroyed.

He's from France.
Why are you angry?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
Do you know who this is?
Did you see baseball on TV last night?
Mary photographed her mother on her cell phone.
I wanted to die.
It'll do the same to me whether it comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not about money.
Would you like to see them?
You destroyed him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like humans.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I won't be long.
We need to know what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me clarify my position.
I never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
Are you 18?
I want to do sports.
Tom was alive.
Thomas' phone rang, but he ignored it.
Can you teach me French?
The price was outrageous.
Sort of.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek myths?
He's 40.
What time do you leave?
Tom gave Mary a French dictionary.
Our captain has welcomed us.
He went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to bring her down with love poems.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.

Tom hugged Mary.
Weren't you going to Australia to build stores?
What do you call that?

You're not Canadian.
I visited Boston many years ago.
Tom questioned Mary.
Tom has a twin brother.
I'll translate.
We stayed three nights in Boston.
I'm starting to find you tiring.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom's wearing gloves.
The letter is written by the girl.
Someone screamed.
He didn't go to the lake.
He speaks French fluently.
I'm taller than you.
Have you lost the proof?
Are you afraid of losing your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom will be back?
Tom doesn't have red hair.
Can I borrow your headphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm impartial.
I think Tom's drunk.

Work hard.

I'm gay.
You're easy to believe.
Tom's not a hero.
I'm glad I could help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys aren't mine.
That was the last customer.
Do you like white wine?
They were wrong.
I say it and say it again.
Turn on the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like spiders.
I couldn't sleep.
Do you learn Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
This won't happen again.
Russia's big.
The teacher is friendly.
You ruined her.
I'm sorry, I can't sit for long.
I'm a Harvard graduate.
Tom died before his son was born.
Look what I can do.
There's nothing you can do.
I don't want you to tell her.

Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I can't lie to him.

I'm grateful for what he's done.
I'm kind of tired, too.
Are you sure you're not imagining things?
Don't apologize.
He's walking slow.
Come with us.
Nobody wants to take responsibility.

He helped me a lot.
Planes enable people to travel long distances quickly.
Don't you have anything better to do?
In my opinion, you're beautiful.
Let's all go home now.
With the rain stopped, the game resumed.
Tom has my keys.
He seems happy.
We've prepared well.
Were you happy?
Tom will forgive you.
You like putting me to bed, don't you?
Is it raining?
He's very slippery.
They'll hear us.
I got up early.
We'll have to wait.
I think he's my friend.
What were you doing there?
The time will come for you to understand.
I'll eat it.
Tell her to stop.
I told him.
We're from Boston.
Does Tom know French?
These cars are manufactured in Japan.
Can I ask you something?
I work at a bank.
We'll stop you.
Global warming is in orbit to turn mountain peaks into simple rocks into less than a century.
"Did you do this on Monday?" "No, I didn't."
Tom's smiling.
He loves Tom, not me.
I'm pretty strict about that.
Cars are necessary.
Tell him you can't do it.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I was lucky.
Pick whoever you want.
I live on Park Street.
Where's the exit?
My favorite color is blue.
Tom's family lives in Boston.
She speaks Russian.
The kids are asleep.
You look disappointed.
Tom works for Mary's father.
You're a lot faster than I am.
Why don't you go play with her?
Is it blue?
Tell me that's not true.
He left without saying anything.
I advised you not to buy this house.
Tom's popular.
That's very expensive.
He was disappointed.
The dog's white.
When are you coming?
Mary is my wife.
Looks like someone's calling you.
How many tickets did you get?
I was never in Paris.
Tom has visited Australia three times.
It's going to snow today.
I heard voices.
No, thanks, I don't drink beer.
Tom said it was unfair.
Do you believe in eternal life?
I'll fight.
Millie doesn't eat an apple.
I don't like wine.
You're smarter than her.
How much do you want?
Who knows the answers?
They killed Tom.
I rarely eat out.
On your knees!
Please hurry up.
You're drunk!
We've seen him.
They have potatoes in France but not in Holland.
What can we do for Tom?
We think it's unfair.
Did you invite them to the party?
You need to clean up your class.
Why are you laughing?
We have a lot of schools.
Mary's blackmailing Tom.
He doesn't speak; he screams!
Are you from Australia?
They won.
What were you eating?
We're proud of Tom.
Horses are animals.
You're smarter than them.
Love what you're doing.
Which football team do you support?
I get up at 6:30.
I like rice.
Tom shook his fists.
They ate at the restaurant.
I like that shirt.
Are you ready?
Good evening, what are you doing?
I won't tell anyone you're in Boston.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Anything else?
Tom's single.
Are you going to Boston next week?
You look happy today.
I want you to stay.
We're gonna get screwed.
That's easy to say, hard to do.
She showed me her room.
When's he coming?
Australia is a beautiful country.
They'll fix it.
I don't care if you go or not.
It was weird.
Nobody understands him.
Tom doesn't have much money.
Tom grew up in Boston.
Do you have a red pencil?
Everyone knows me.
Mary believes you.
You're older than her.
Let me clarify my position.
I never understood that.
She washes her head.
You're smarter than him.
Time will tell.
I won't be there.
We didn't know who he was.
Is your car black?
I'm texting them.
Tom's gone to Boston.
Tom's not fair.
Tom wrote three letters.
Tom's not your brother.
Where are you from, my friends?
I've had a lot of coffee.
He likes walking.
The man is young.
He's not Algerian.
My car's faster than yours.
I don't live in Boston.
Tom likes all my friends.
What does she want?
Stop your stupidity.
Our university has a good library.
My horse is white.
Tom has returned from Australia.
I'll sit with you.
I'll call you tonight.
I'm from Kyoto.
He's jealous of his wife.
Can I have one of these?
Pass me the pepper, please.
Was anyone in the car?
That's my baby.
Nobody moved.
French is not an easy language.
Tom came home tired.
Stop Tom.
They're older than she is.
Did you hear her speak French?
I read a book last night.
He was accused of nepotism.
Tell us about your trip.
Tom says it's urgent.
Tom had to accept things the way they were.
How old are you?
He likes to read newspapers.
We'll find them.
My father was Greek.
They were mine.
Are you shy?
You can't kill us all.
He didn't know what to say.
I wouldn't like to lie to her.
I saw Tom in the library.
Tom plans to stay in Boston until October.
To clarify my position.
Is it important?
I assumed you were Canadians.
You bought a new house.
You never cared about me.
The thief disguised himself as a police officer.
Can I walk you out?
I thought we might be here all day.
Tom and Mary seem to be fighting all the time.
Tom gave me thirty bucks.
Tom didn't want to touch her.
He knew all along.
Everything went well.
Emilia asked me a question.
Tell them to come see me.
You played.
I wonder which route is shorter.
There's a safe in Tom's office.
I want to go with Tom.
Who sent it?
I hope to see you soon.
Carol reads Spanish.
Everyone agreed to his idea.
Come quickly.
You have to stay.
I grew up in that neighborhood.
That's hard.
I'll fight.
He's still here.
Nobody's sitting here.
Where were you last Monday?
She met him three years ago.
Tom translated the document from French to English.
It was empty.
‘Thank you.’ ‘Please.’
I have something to say.
Everyone's waiting for Tom.
Tom did this to you?
You need to help your friends.
I'm not gonna lie.
Who did you go to the dance with?
You're not contributing enough.
You're my best friend.
Tom's accomplishments are impressive.
Give me what you got.
Keep talking.
Don't leave me here alone.
Tell them it's important.
You shot them.
I'll pray for Tom.
I'm too old for Mary.
Who discovered the phone?
He forgot to turn off the light.
Give me 30 minutes.
They look happy.
They work hard.
Tell her you can't do it.
You destroyed it.
You have a few books.
We're ready to help.
What did your teacher ask you about?
Tom loved Mary very much.
Is it yours?
I'll buy a new one.
Tom's afraid I'll get lost.
I'm very tired.
I want to learn guitar.
Do you like your car?
He was elected mayor.
Did you help Tom?
It's my turn now.
It makes my life a torture.
Tom gave me that tie.
I wish I was born Canadian.
I miss him.
Were you happy?
She's happy.
You're incredibly stupid.
I won't wait for you.
Is Tom sick?
What do you want?
We like kids.
He was wearing a black hat.
I closed my eyes.
Tell him you don't need it.
I like to dance.
You got the wrong key.
I thought Tom was Canadian.
They were young.
He died quickly.
Are you angry?
What are you doing?
Tom's a mathematician.
Are you a friend of Tom's?
How did you miss it?
Each year the world population increases by an average of two per cent.
Tom was the prime suspect.
I thought you were Canadian.
I'd never think I'd meet you here.
I want you to sing.
Let me go!
Tom killed Mary.
Do you speak Hebrew?
Who did Tom sell his car to?
You guys are so weird.
Get over here right now.
They speak French.
We have to finish it all by Monday morning.
Yeah, sure.
Your husband is cheating on you.
Tom is obedient.
Merchants only look at profits.
He married him for his money.
A lot of people in the world like spicy food.
Mary plays the piano.
I don't love Tom.
I have to go to bed now.
I want to live in Brazil.
Do good to those who hate you.
What exactly are you trying to prove?
Tell her you lied.
English is not my mother tongue.
Will you give me your number, please?
Leave it there.
He may have his flaws, but I like him.
Don't believe it.
Who's your teacher?
I always listen to music; I cannot live without it.
It's gonna be hot today.
Kiss Tom.
Who?
Tom's very quiet.
He made me a cake.
Is your car quick?
I've been up since 7:00 this morning.
What the hell did Tom mean by that?
He's a quiet man.
I ran to the bus stop so I wouldn't miss the last bus.
Thomas told me Mary was in jail.
I'm fine, thanks for asking!
I saw Tom last Monday walking with Mary in the park.
They've sold the TV.
If you have anything to say, say it.
This house isn't too big.
Tom was busy.
I like to laugh.
I'm rich.
Do you want to marry me?
I like music and English.
He slept at 10:00 yesterday.
You still haven't told me who you are.
I have as many books as Tom.
I like that song.
You're a patient woman.
You'll be safe with Tom.
Give me another chance.
There's a stack of books on the table.
We'll have to choose the right person for each position.
Think first!
Do you trust this man?
Who's gonna count the stars?
This is a game for four players.
Don't come near the dog.
Yes, I'm coming!
Tom misses his wife and children.
Where did you go the Sunday we passed?
Hold both hands on the steering wheel.
He made me a cake.
Is Tom lying?
Where was he born?
That's unprecedented.
No one ever came to see me at the hospital.
You're not thirty.
Everything was perfect.
It's really fun listening to music.
I think Tom's right.
Life is short, although the smile only lasts a second.
Now I know the truth.
My mother's here.
Betty's been here lately.
Did he admit it?
It seems to me you don't often help other people.
Wait, I want to tell you something.
Next time I'm in Boston, I'll try to visit you.
I know a lot of pilots.
We were fighting to survive.
We're not afraid.
Do you want this?
You're not yourself.
They were yours.
The house is too big for us and besides, it's too expensive.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Australia is a fantastic country.
They're smiling.
"She kissed you?" "Yes." "I knew it!"
I'm on deck.
I have more money than you.
Tell me about your son.
You still live on Park Street?
Unlock the door.
He's so young.
Tom and Mary are living together, but they're not legally married.
We went to a nice restaurant.
Tom doesn't hate you.
They trust him.
Are you members of a gym?
Where do you want to go?
There are books here.
I helped my father yesterday.
Nonsense!
I just did what Tom asked me to do.
Tom told us not to be afraid.
I need to learn French.
Two beers, please.
Tom will survive.
Laurie lives in Melbourne.
Lock the door.
This event moved me.
Let me make my position clearer.
They don't need money.
Mary's Tom's kind of wife.
That boy has black hair.
What do you know about Australia?
Nobody knows how it works.
You look tired.
We were both very hungry.
He died last week.
Tell them to stop worrying.
Everyone laughed.

I'll show you.
You're staying here tonight.

I refuse to accept that.
We all know you.
Have some water.
The dog likes cats.
Are you alive?
He's a good singer.
Tell him I'm sick.
Tom died in 2013 in Australia.
My love for you is hard to explain.
What's this?
Why did you stop?
Tom saved her from the fire.
Food's good.
I'll walk you out.
Save them.
I wanted to tell you the truth.
The streets are covered in snow.
How happy I am today!
I can't see you.
She allowed me to see her daughter.
My house is near the school.
I assumed you were Canadian.
You've been busy.
It was easy for me to solve the problem.
I'd like you to stay with me.
Tom was married to a Canadian.
I'll wait for you here at 2:30.
Discarding hurts.
I hope this goes on.
I thought I heard Tom's voice.
What were you talking about?
Come with me to Boston.
Do you swim often?
I felt awkward with so many people watching me.
I'm doing what I have to do.
Peter loves Jane.
Tom painted his hair black.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
I took it as a joke, and I didn't answer.
Tell them I'm ready.
When did you buy it?
Tell them I won't do that.
I'm not a doctor.
When I was sick, Tom came and made me dinner.
My favorite color is orange.
Are you a Canadian citizen?
I'll wait for you 2:30.
Is anyone here?
Tom laughed when Mary said that.
Mary is my wife.
She's looking forward to seeing him again.
Tom emigrated in 2013 to Australia.
Is there bread?
Throw him out.
I'll watch TV.
See you in about an hour.

Do you like your new job?
It's good to see you again.
How do I find it?
She's the most beautiful woman.
A week ago, I had a tooth extraction.
You can take a taxi.
I rarely watch documentary.

When did you finish it?
Kids like to drink fruit juice.
You'll learn to speak fluent Portuguese!

What else did you tell him?
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
I can't remember Tom taking the day off.
Tell them I'm not here.
Tom's gonna change.
What are they gonna do?

When did you buy him?
Tell him to leave.
We want to create the least possible disturbance.
We were born the same day.
You're indecisive.
She promised me she'd come.
That wasn't necessary.
If you can read this, then you can speak a language.
Everyone agrees.
I survived.
Tell her to come here.
I've always dreamed of going to Australia.
You can wait here.

Come quickly!
I've never been to Paris.
Torture a prisoner.
You're in everything perfect.

Where do you work?
Nice suit.
Please come before 2:30.

Someone needs to talk to Tom.
His real name is Tom.
We can't change history, but we can learn from it.
He's not married.
Your English is perfect.
Tom has money.
Asshole!
It's not raining.
Tell them you're not ready.
I was thinking of something in sushi.
Let's wait for Tom.

What town do you live in?
Didn't you read the story?
It weighs more than 80 pounds.
My parents are in Australia.
My guitar is new.
They'll fix him.
Where are you going?
You'll have to memorize all these dates.
Did you invite him to the party?
You're unbelievable.
Save Tom.
He shares a room with his brother.
Aren't you happy?
He was alone.
Tell them I'm innocent.

How much does that banana cost?
Tom will find you.
My dog's in heat.
My name is Farsad.
I love Tom.
We're both tired.
Don't leave me alone.
Haven't you learned anything from your mistakes?
That's not the target.
Don't talk about my girlfriend like that.
I didn't say he was easy.
It's raining today.
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.
Do you have the source code?
How awful to think that what people say about us is true!
First lesson is easy.
Thomas painted.
I think Tom's still in Boston.
Dogs look happy.
I don't want to know your language.
Did you lose?
He likes football.

Will you tell them?
Tom will find us.
Yesterday we played tennis.
Tell him I'm ready.
Your clothes always stink.
What did we miss?
