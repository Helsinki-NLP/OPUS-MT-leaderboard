Welsh MPs are worried they're gonna be confused with the "matchets"
Some Members expressed their concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This concern arose in relation to the plans to change the name of the Parliament of Wales Assembly.
Members across the political spectrum are concerned that this will sound ridiculous.
A Labour MP said his group is concerned that "he will rhyme with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, the word "twp" means "stupid" and the word "pwp" means "adjectives".
A Plade MP said the party as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative stated that his own party was "open-minded" about changing the name, but noted that the word MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the English pronunciation of Yorkshire of the letter u.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently drafting the bill establishing the name change, said: "The final decision on any name by which Members will be called will of course be a matter for Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave Parliament of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted for the name of parliament as the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of Members, the Commission supported the name "Member of the Parliament of Wales" or WMP, but it is the MWP option that received greater support during the public consultation.
MPs obviously propose alternatives, but trying to reach a consensus can be a difficult case for Parliament's President, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill to change the name within the following weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes in the way the parliament operates, including rules of deduction from the Member's office and the design of the committee system.
Members will decide in the final vote on the issue of their names when discussing the legislation.
Macedonian citizens come to the polls for referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote Sunday on changing the country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The people's vote was requested in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens claims that the name of its northern neighbour conceals territorial aspirations and has repeatedly opposed its demands for EU and NATO membership.
Gjorge Ivanov, president of Macedonia, warring the referendum on changing the name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that change is just the price they have to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells have been silenced as the churches in Harlem disappear
"The older people I spoke to, they say there used to be a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today, there is neither."
He said he understands why the bars disappeared.
"The world is socializing in a different way today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood's 'salon' where people hang out regularly".
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the responsible "and sooner or later they will return to the point where they started."
The churches, he added, may be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who will not be willing to help the places of worship left in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said," and therefore will speed up the day where all these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that all those people who move into these apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan community was built in 1870, St Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black church located nearby took possession of the building.
The possession of St. Martin's building took over a black church under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who went on to boycott the 125th Street stores, a key trade street in Harlem, which they refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners took over the reconstruction and ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's church, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The specialist who played the carillon in July described it somewhat differently: "cultural treasure" and "unreplaced instrument of historical importance".
The expert, Tiffany In from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who was transferred to a larger carillon in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's church did not replace him.
What has been happening in recent months to St. Martin is a complicated story between architects and contractors, some of whom were hired by the church's lay leaders, while others by the diocese.
The commissioners - the parish's administrative body, consisting of the lay leaders - sent to the diocese in July a letter about their concerns that the diocese "would seek to transfer costs" to the college of commissioners, despite this having had nothing to do with hiring architects and contractors sent by the church.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark attack on 13-year-old in a lobster dive in California
Shark attacked and injured 13-year-old boy on Saturday during lobster fishing dives in California, on the first day of the lobster era, according to authorities.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Ensinita town.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the cries of the child asking for help and approached rowing with a team to get it out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just screams of excitement because he caught lobster, but then he realized he was yelling "Something bit me!
Something bit me!"
His entire clavicle had been opened," Hammel remarked when he arrived at the place where the boy was located.
"I shouted at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the sea!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Lifeguard Larry Giles stated in the press release that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was considered not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim has severe injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities banned access to the beach from Ponto Biss in Kasabland to Swamis in Ensinita for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans put pressure on the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by placing cosmetic shelves corresponding to those of department stores, staffed with special employees.
In the context of the significant rise in the UK cosmetics market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while the sales of clothing and household goods are falling, the largest cosmetic shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country and spread to more stores if the project succeeds.
Investment in the cosmetics sector comes as supermarkets look for a way to make up for the space on shelves that once occupied televisions, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's said they would double their cosmetic supply size to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more shelf space with the company logo, similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket re-launchs its own Boutique makeup series so that most products are vegan – something younger consumers are increasingly calling for.
In addition, the perfume company The Fragrance Shop will try to dispose of its products at two Sainsbury's stores, the one opened in Croydon, South London, last week and the other at Shelley Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Electronic markets and the trend of buying small amounts of food daily in local minimarkets means that supermarkets should make greater efforts to make people visit them.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said outlet stores would increasingly resemble department stores, as supermarket chains try to compete with Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more off-food services.
Sainsbury's put outlet Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and also imported some Habitat as they bought both chains two years ago, which supported grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renovate cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a consortium with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to distribute profits from pharmacy stores to supermarkets in the chain.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 stores in Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, against £125 million, three years ago.
She stated Lloyds would play her own role in the project, adding an expanded range of luxury care companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of the Sainsbury's, said: "We transformed the appearance and sense of our shelves in order to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained personnel who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our companies is designed to meet every need, while the attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a strong destination for cosmetics which questions the traditional way of buying."
Peter Jones: furious after Holly Willoughby left the £11 million deal
The protagonist of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, is furious after telepresenter Holly Willoughby left the £11 million deal with her lifestyle business in order to devote herself to her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for clothing company and Truly accessories.
Their business was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop company.
The 37-year-old host of the show "This Morning", announced on Instagram her decision to leave.
Holly Willoughby furious the protagonist of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, leaving their profitable lifestyle business at the last minute, in order to devote herself to her new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became furious when the gold television girl admitted during a conference full of tensions Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that due to her new contracts - £1.5 million - she would no longer have enough time to spare the clothing and accessories company Truly.
The company was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop company and appears to have doubled Wiloby's estate estimated to amount to £11 million.
Following the announcement of 37-year-old Willoughby on Instagram that he is going to leave Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his cottages.
According to one source: "Truly was far from Holly Willoughby's top priorities.
It was its long-term future, its source of revenue for the next decades.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone involved in the operation.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There is a warehouse full of products at the headquarters in Marlowe ready to be sold."
Experts estimate that the departure of the show's presenter "This Morning", which is among Britain's most commercial celebrities, could cost the company millions due to the huge investment in products from pillows and candles to household clothing and clothing, as well as further delaying its presentation.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have maintained close friendly relations with Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
Couples spend their vacations together and Jones maintains a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby is to become the central person in the M&S campaigns and replace Ad McPartlin in the presentation of the "I'm A Celebrity" show on ITV.
A source from Jones' close environment said last night "We wouldn't want to comment on his professional affairs."
We were tough, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he received from the media about a comment that some would consider inappropriate to a president, as well as his such positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said by imitating the telepresenter style.
"I didn't give up anything."
He stated Kim was interested in a second meeting, after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was greeted by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on denuclearization have been delayed.
Over three months after the summit in June in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ry Yong-ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see any "recital response" from the US after North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, he stressed, the US continues to apply sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trump kept a much more optimistic attitude in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We almost had a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have built this extraordinary relationship."
He stated that his efforts to improve his relations with Kim yielded positive results – ending missile tests, releasing hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
While supporting his unusual attitude to statements about his relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a 'presidential' look, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the hall because they couldn't get in, we would have just 200 people here," Trump said, showing the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia sweep an entire island, leaving thousands dead in their wake
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was announced that foreign non-governmental organizations would not need assistance.
Although more than 10 percent of Lobok's population were displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for the use of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they are not seeking international aid, it is therefore quite difficult," said Mrs Subung.
While Save the Children organization is preparing a team that will travel to Palou, it is not yet certain whether foreign personnel will be able to work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the national agency for natural disasters, said that Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations would be allowed to contribute assistance.
Given the earthquake vibrations that often hit Indonesia, the country remains horribly unprepared against the wrath of nature.
While shelters have been built for tsunamis in Ache, this is not the case in other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami alarm siren in Palou, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
At best, moving between the numerous Indonesian islands is difficult.
Natural disasters complicate administrative care even more.
A floating hospital stationed in Lobok to care for the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Guidodo had the focus of his election campaign on improving Indonesia's disorganized infrastructure and generously allocated money to build roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding plagues Mr. Joko's administration, before re-election the following year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from persistent fanatical tendencies in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as groups of Christians and Muslims fight on the streets, using swords, bows, and arrows, as well as other improvised weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturge equals against Chelsea
Daniel Sturge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Steridge accepted a pass from Serdan Sakiri about 27 metres away from Chelsea's finish with his team losing 1–0.
He hit the ball on his left and shot the back beam.
His effort was driven very high from the large area and ended up on the top right in the nets.
The ball eventually fell over Kepa Arizabalaga who jumped to ward her off and entered the nets.
"I was trying to take this position, reach the ball and players like Shakiri always play as far forward as possible, so I tried to gain as much time as possible," Steridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Canté approaching, I made a direct switch, I didn't think about it much, and I did the shot."
Chelsea had the 1–0 lead in the half after the goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Entin Azhar.
The blue striker gave a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in this game, before giving a falcho shot near the center of the field and running to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made one or two in the center of the field.
He then gave a deep throw, leading Azhar to the great area.
Azhar ran ahead of the defender and completed by sending the ball to the nets on the rear beam with a left shot ahead of Liverpool's Allison Becker.
Liverpool will fight against Napoli in the Champions League group phase at 3 p.m. Wednesday at Standio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The tragic account of tsunami deaths in Indonesia is 832
The account of deaths after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia is 832, according to the country's natural disaster agency statements early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the wreckage of the buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-degree earthquake that hit the area on Friday and created waves of a height of 6 metres, Service spokesman, Sutopo Puroo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palos, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the wreckage of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested 32-year-old suspect after murder of a woman with a knife.
A murder investigation began after a woman's body was discovered in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Muse on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
The police asked the residents who saw or heard something testifying to the police.
Officer Brian Ohagan said: "The investigation is at an initial stage but I would like to appeal to anyone in the neighbouring area around John Street and saw or heard something suspicious contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something in the footage from Dashcam cameras to contact us as they may have information that is vital to our investigation in their possession."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a building.
This afternoon friends who think they might know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police said they are in the process of informing the closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mousse, in his attempt to return to his apartment was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The tenants were informed that it may take hours before they were allowed to return home.
A police officer reportedly told a man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman showed up with tears on stage.
He kept repeating "it's horrible."
At 2 p.m. two police vans were located through the police ribbon and one out.
Police officers stood outside the ribbon and watched the apartment building.
Anyone who has any information please send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestopers line at 0800 555 111 for Case 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the last monument struck by the quarrel over the "rewriting of history"
His ostracism would constitute poetic justice for the talibanist destruction of numerous cultural and religious works of England by his fanatical Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Association described Mr. Creek's proposal as "imbecile" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "In this discussion about removing statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's form outside Westminster Palace would not be targeted.
The picclassification of England's civil wars was not dictated or performed by Cromwell.
Possibly, the wrong member of the Cromwell family was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas' ancestor during the previous century.
Cromwell's excellent representation by Sir William Hamo Thorncroft is typical of his image in the 19th century and part of the historiography of a personality that many believe is worthy of tribute.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still considered by many, perhaps more during the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate matter is the subject of an open historical debate.
All that is certain is that conflicts in the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation and Cromwell is a recognizable personality representing one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also laudable and memorable."
Pig-killer fatally injures Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in Southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, whose only surname "Wan" was disclosed, was found with a severed artery inside a pool of blood near a pigsty in the market of Lioupansoy in the province of Guichow, in Southern China Morning Post announced Sunday.
An employee in a pigsty is preparing to do vaccines to pigs on May 30, 2005 in Zining in Kinhai Province, China.
He is alleged to have traveled along with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door of a neighboring pighouse.
He stated that in the pigsty there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
The coroner's examination confirmed that the pig weighing 227 kg had fatally injured the farmer, according to his report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and butchered," said Cousin, known by his surname "W", according to Guyang's evening newscast.
Security camera footage shows Wan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Wan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening newscast that the pig has been placed in a cage to not attack anyone else, while police collected the evidence at the attack scene.
Wan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating some compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pig attacks on humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 195 - kilo pig threw a farmer into Wales on his tractor until the farmer’s wife scared the animal away.
Following the incident in which a Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "inflammation".
"They're just in a playful mood.
They're small, very strange creatures... they don't want to hurt.
We should just show them proper respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa remains are to bring extensive rainfall to the Southwest USA
According to predictions, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the coldest water masses of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring cataclysmic rainfall to Northern Mexico and the Southwest U.S. over the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa's wind power reached 85 mph, becoming Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. Eastern time, Sunday and was spotted 385 miles southwest of Punta Euhenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure wind area has begun to form over the Pacific ocean and move east to the West Coast of the United States. As Hurricane Rosa approaches the Lower California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will bring tropical moisture to the north in the Southwest USA.
Hurricane Rosa will bring rainfalls of 25 cm in Mexico areas on Monday.
The tropical humidity then combined with the approaching low wind pressure area will create extensive strong rainfall in the Southwest over the next few days.
Locally, rains between 2.5 and 10 centimetres will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates close to 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per place, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Rains 5 to 10 centimetres are expected locally in the Southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapid deterioration of phenomena due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is recommended to avoid any foot movement in the desert in view of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Strong rainfall can turn gorges into rushing rivers and storms will cause local heavy winds and sanding.
The low-pressure wind area will create some local strong rainfall locally on the South California coastline.
Total rainfall height over 1 centimeter is possible, which can cause small debris flows and slipperyness on the streets.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the area.
Some scattered tropical storms will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early morning hours on Monday, before phenomena expand slowly on Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rainfall will spread to the For Corners area on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October some severe temperature changes will be observed across the United States as temperatures in the Arctic fall, but in tropical zones they remain quite high.
At times, this leads to very intense temperature changes at nearby distances.
A typical example of intense temperature differences between the central US was observed Sunday.
There was a difference of almost 10 points between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moyne, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent high summer temperatures will be observed and spread again.
In much of the Central and Eastern US, October is expected to begin with high temperatures with 27 °C from the Eastern plains to sections in the Southeast.
Temperature in New York can reach 27 °C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above average.
According to our long-term forecast for weather, there are several possibilities to see temperatures above the average in the East U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers attended Brett Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million viewers attended the candidate's stagnant testimony for the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Cavanaugh, Thursday and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blaise Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with television networks interrupting the regular flow of the last-minute overthrow program on Friday: the agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a week's investigation by the FBI in connection with the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that he is 100 percent sure that at a party while they were high school students Cavanaugh attacked her while he was drunk and attempted to take her clothes off.
Cavanaugh, in a charged statement, said he was 100 percent certain that this was not the case.
According to Nielsen's measurements, they are likely to have attended the hearing on Friday over 20.4 million viewers.
The company estimated average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC networks.
The numbers did not immediately become available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
While also, Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate the number of viewers watching a broadcast from office spaces.
Let's look at this ratings in its right dimensions, it's an audience of similar size to what's watching a playoff football game or the Oscar Award Ceremony.
Fox News channel, whose journalists strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, preceded an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
In second place, ABC is located with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS followed with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake became a protagonist in Friday's drama.
Following the Republican moderate's statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded Friday morning protesters booing him as he was trying to get into the elevator for the hearing by the Senate Justice Commission.
He stood with the look low for several minutes as he was disapproved of, live on television on CNN.
"I stand here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He said, "You have authority when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had made statements and, before the elevator doors were closed, that he would have more to say at the Commission hearing.
All cable and transmission networks covered live a few hours later, the Senate Justice Committee vote on promoting Cavanaugh's candidacy in the Senate plenary to vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate next week, which was requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partially convinced after discussions with his friend, Democratic Party Senator, Chris Kuns.
After discussions with Kuns and some other Senators then, Flake ruled.
Flake's choice was valid, because it was obvious that Republicans would not collect votes for Cavanaugh's approval without conducting an investigation.
President Trump asked the FBI for an investigation into the allegations against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of leaving the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Britain's Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview along with hers on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson strongly criticizes the Checkers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal to collect tariffs between Britain and the EU was "totally absurd".
Wade Sims Shot: Police Arrest Suspect Dieteon Simpson for Killing Player at LSU
Police arrested a suspect for the deadly shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball team player.
Dieteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained in prison on second-degree murder charge, according to Baton Rouge police station.
Authorities have in their hands a video of Simms' encounter with Simpson and according to police Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police officers located the glasses at the crime scene and stated that they detected traces of Simpson's DNA, according to the WAFB working with CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, police said they admitted he fatally wounded Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report by East Baton Rouge coroner released Friday, cause of death is the bullet injury to the head and neck.
The Ministry made available to the Louisiana Police a special task force, the police forensic lab, the South University police forces and the local citizens for assistance in investigating the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joey Altereva thanked local law enforcement authorities for "insidious investigation and pursuit of justice."
Simms was 20 years old.
Forward a height of 1.98 metres raised Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach Oil Owaid said the team is "distressed" and "in shock" since Wade's death.
"We are always worried about incidents like this," said Wade.
Volcanic ash emissions in Mexico City
Volcanic ash emissions from the Popokatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexican residents Sunday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater reached its peak, with the recording of 183 gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The Center watched various readings and small seismic vibrations.
Images on social media show car windshields covered with thin ash layers in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Sochimilko.
Geophysics noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since there was an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 thrower in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police forces clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a pro-independence protester clash with the class rehabilitation units, as thousands participated in the protests for the first anniversary of the vote on the secession of Catalonia that caused polarization.
A group of masked pro-independence protesters, held by class rehabilitation units, launched eggs and paint into dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets usually flooded by tourists.
Conversations also occurred later during the day with police officers using their clubs to suppress the clashes.
For hours groups of supporters of Catalonia's independence shouted the slogan "We don't forgive, we don't forget" against groups of protestors in favour of the unity of the country who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated with minor injuries occurring during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain high in the area supporting independence a year after the referendum of 1 October was declared illegal by Madrid, but it is celebrated by the separatist Catalans.
The vast majority of voters chose independence, although turnout was low with those who oppose independence boycotting the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1000 people were injured last year, after police authorities tried to stop voting at the polling centers in the region where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups camped late Friday night to prevent a demonstration of support from the national police.
The demonstration took place but was forced to take a different turn.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the pro-independence protests with his wife, said he no longer had hopes of Catalonia's prospects of gaining independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our brightest moments.
I saw my parents with tears of joy that managed to vote, but now the situation is stagnant," he said.
Although they noted a victory of vital importance although limited in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties struggled to maintain their momentum this year, with many of their best known leaders being self-exile or detained pending their trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Pooch, a 42-year-old engineer, who recorded the pro-police protests on his cell phone, said the clashes were fueled by politicians from both camps.
"The tension is increasingly escalating," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Zunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders imprisoned last year, announced his nomination in the European elections for next year.
"My nomination in the European elections is the best way to denounce the suppression of democratic values and the oppression we have received from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonteri: Arresting man after car crash in residence
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeated car impact on a residence in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded at Bolinagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemings said damage was caused to the gates and to the building itself.
There may have been a shooting in the car at some point.
Menga's hit gave Livingston a 1–0 win against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers by giving Stephen Gerard just his second loss at 18 games as manager of the Imbrox Group.
Dolly Menga's hit made a difference as Gary Holt's side changed level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team remains without a win away in the league this season and faces the Harts, who have the lead with eight points, next Sunday.
Prior to this match, Rangers host Rapid Vienna at the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston in the meantime continues undefeated her race in six games in her category, with main coach Holt not yet tasted any defeat since she replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before scoring, with its directness embarrassing the Rangers.
Scott Robinson took a lead and nearly got there just before the finish, but Alan Lithgow repelled his attempt by slipping Craig Halket's header away from the finish.
The hosts willingly let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could push visitors to free hits and corners.
And that's how the important goal came along.
The Rangers were unable to prevent a free hit and Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to send the ball to Menga, who took the pass and scored from downtown the area.
By that point, the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball but found impenetrable the defense of the hosts and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This figure continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos repelled the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was repelled by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's legs and Stonegow's pass went out in another free hit of Livingston.
Many vertical passes were made in the Livingston area and were constantly repelled, while two penalty penalties were requested – after claiming the ball from Halket against substitute player Glen Middleton and one for hand – which were rejected.
"Excellent game" by Livingston - analysis
Alassder Lamont from the BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena stadium
Spectacular performance and results for Livingston.
Everyone, without exception, was exceptional, overcoming expectations in this ascending course.
Their game style and personality changed little after returning to top form, but credit should also be given to Holt for the boost he gave the team upon his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Chief Halket was excellent, recruiting an extremely organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joey Warrell on the lookout throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the contrary, had no inspiration.
As good as they were in the past under Gerard's guidance, they did not meet these standards.
Their last game was incomplete – only once managed to pass the home defense and this is a warning bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Mixed feelings at Erdogan's reception in Cologne
The climate was good Saturday (September 29th) at the meeting of the Turkish and German Heads of State for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed at restoring relations with NATO allies.
They had broken in relation to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to launch a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
Police ruled out for security reasons the gathering of the crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters managed to get close to seeing their president in person.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom of Kurdish origin - also gave the present, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The split of protesters reflects the controversial nature of a visitor treated by some Turkish-Germans as a hero and by others as a dictator.
Traffic accident in Detfort: death of a cyclist after a car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Detfort, in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and ambulance rescuers tried to help, but the man lost his life on the spot.
The conflict occurred a few months after a similar incident where a driver hit and abandoned a cyclist, who lost his life on Childers Street Road, about 1.6 km from the Saturday accident.
Metropolitan Police said authorities are making efforts to identify the man and inform their closest relatives.
The roads have been closed and bus routes have been diverted, while drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prisons: Six police officers injured in clashes
Six police officers were injured in riots that broke out in maximum security men's prisons, according to the prison administration's statements.
Riots broke out in His Majesty's Long Lartin prisons in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still underway.
Special police forces "Tornado" have been drafted to deal with the riots, involving eight prisoners and which were manifested in one wing.
Police officers were treated with minor facial injuries during the complications.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained personnel undertook to face the incident in His Majesty's prisons Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police authorities and may serve a greater sentence."
In His Majesty's prisons Long Lartin more than 500 prisoners are held, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June the Prison Administrative Officer was hospitalized after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year class rehabilitation units were called to prison to suppress serious incidents that broke out, during which staff members were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (dried areas may benefit)
It is rare for a tropical recession to strike Arizona, but this is just likely to happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosa's remains will cross the southwest parts of the desert, bringing flooding to their passage.
The National Weather Service has already issued emergency flood warning reports for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to south and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass right over Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will arrive late Monday in rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service pointed out in its tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have remained in a tropical storm state or low barometric at less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the U.S. National Hurricane Center predict a rainfall of 2 to 4 inches high, with individual rain volumes of up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other areas of the Southwest States, including central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, there may be rainfall of 1 to 2 inches high, with a possibility of individual total rain volumes of up to 4 inches.
For areas not at risk of flooding, the rain that Rosa brings can be a blessing, as the area is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, part of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the Southwestern States are currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Land Watch, more than 40 percent of Arizona is facing at least extreme drought, which is the second highest drought category," weather.com said.
First, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico.
Maintaining hurricane intensity, on Sunday morning Rosa will be 385 miles south of Punta Eujenia, Mexico with maximum winds of 85 miles an hour and moving northward at 12 miles an hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore be weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to reach land in Mexico with tropical storm intensity in the afternoon or Monday night.
There may be severe rainfall in areas of Mexico, which will cause a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall volumes of 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwestern Sonora are expected, likely to reach up to 10 inches," according to weather.com.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm now and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low barometer, which will then pass through Arizona to reach southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main risk expected of Hurricane Rosa or his remains is the very severe rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Southwest States," said the U.S. National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous heavy floods and streams of mud in the deserts and landslides in mountain lands.
Attack on Minchomer Norton: Four Arrests for Attempted Manslaughter · Global Voices
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested as attempted homicide suspects after identifying a 16-year-old who brought knife wounds to Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Monster area of Minchomer Norton, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are calling for anyone who may have recorded on a video on his cell phone what happened.
Trump states that Cavanaugh "lived the badness and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favour of Judge Cavanaugh is a vote to reject Democratic Party's merciless and infuriating tactics," Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Cavanaugh "lived the Democratic Party's malice and anger" throughout his process of emergence as a candidate.
Cavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, categorically denying and with obvious emotion Christine Blaise Ford's claims that he sexually assaulted her decades ago, when she was teenagers.
Ford also testified before a hearing about her allegations.
The President said Saturday that the "American people saw Cavanaugh's greatness, quality and courage" that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Cavanaugh's candidacy is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent public service course," he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Cavanaugh's nomination, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-election.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but it's actually like I am," he said.
"That's why I travel everywhere supporting excellent candidates".
Trump said Democrats are on a "resistance and obstruction" mission.
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, he told CNN a senior auxiliary member of the Republican Party leadership.
Hundreds of people were killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total number of victims is projected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were swept away by the giant waves that swept the coast, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, authorities said Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of Palos on Friday, when waves of a height of six meters struck land at dusk, dragging many to death and destroying everything in their wake.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of 7.5 Richter.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately, when it was hit by it," said Sutopo Purguo Nugroho, a representative of Indonesia's BNPB disaster response agency, in an update in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, drifted cars, wood, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled to the ocean at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palou.
Aerial photos published by disaster response service show many damaged buildings and shops, bridges that have been twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Postshocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Service (BPPT) reported in an announcement that the energy released from Friday's huge earthquake was about 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped in Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a narrow long bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and reported that hundreds of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels collapsed.
He said heaps of victims were found trapped under the wreckage of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damage may be larger along the 300 km coastline north of Palos, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication systems "were completely paralyzed and there is no information" from Dongala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that his staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy and it can get even worse," he said.
Wide criticism was brought to the Service on Saturday because it did not inform that tsunami had hit Palu, even though officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard screaming panicking trying to warn people down the road to the tsunami coming.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, drifting houses and cars.
The Reuters agency was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which also disrupted communications in the wider Palos area, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts by authorities.
The army began sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but displaced people still desperately need food and other essential types of emergency.
The city's airport opened again only to contribute to relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Windodo's visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday is scheduled.
The tsunami victims in Indonesia exceed 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organization from Dongala managed to safely reach the city of Palou, where workers took refuge in accommodations of tarpaulins set up in the courtyard of their office, they passed through disaster scenes along their way, Mr. Dosheba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of damaged houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some relief groups have undertaken the sad task of starting the relief process for the affected, some complain that foreign, particularly experienced workers in the field of assistance were not allowed to travel to Palos.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin if the place of a disaster is declared a zone of national destruction.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says it is a national disaster, we can call for international assistance, but there is no relevant decision yet."
As the second day passed in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing still hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the history of these natural disasters less grim.
On Saturday, a little boy recovered from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days, next to her mother's dead body.
Genton Subanton, coach of Indonesia's national parachute slope team, had trained two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Madaji, were his students.
"As an elder in the paragliding sport, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Genton recounted how, when news was released about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the slope paratrooper community, he began sending desperate messages WhatsApp to his rivals in Palou who participated in the beach festival.
However, the indication next to his messages was a gray "n" symbol, instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves earned $26,750 when refueling an automatic withdrawal machine in Newport on the Levy.
On Friday morning, thieves obtained $26,750 from a Brink employee who was refueling an ATM machine in Newport on Levi, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The vehicle driver had evacuated an ATM machine to the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, police officer Dennis McCarthy said in the announcement.
While busy, another man "came running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects leave the scene, according to the announcement, but the police did not identify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information on their identity should contact Newport police, calling 859-292-3680.
Canye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Canye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the Twitter change on Saturday, he wrote: "The being officially known as Canye West".
West, 41, has long listened to caressing Ye and used this nickname as a title on his eighth album, released in June.
The change preceded his appearance on the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new album titled Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons", as show creator said.
Besides being an abbreviation of the professional name he uses today, West had previously stated that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, which means 'you', West had previously stated this year, in a discussion about his album title with radio producer Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us, it's us.
My name changes from Kanye, meaning "the only one", to Ye, which is just a reflection of good, evil, our confused self, of everything.
The album is probably a reflection of who we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Shin Cobbs is known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Didi or Didi, but announced this year that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, JAY-ZI, is also satisfied with using his name in or without dash and capital letters.
The elected President of Mexico vows he won't use the army against civilians
Mexican elected President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed he would never use military violence against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolko Plaza Square that he would "never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired against a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were gaining roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people towards criminal gangs.
The US will have to double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in this field, states the investor and professional in the field of Kai-Foo Li artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment comes to be added to announcements of various parts of the U.S. government about artificial intelligence, as the US does not overall have an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China last year presented its plan to become the world's first country in innovation on artificial intelligence issues by 2030.
"The doubling of the research budget on artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are so much behind the US and we are seeking to make the next major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The budget doubling could double the chances of taking place in the US the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book titled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The super powers of artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order of things) was released this month by the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt publications, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the leading artificial intelligence companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an artificial intelligence system that defeated the best American player Othello, while later was an executive of Microsoft Research and president of Google's branch in China.
Lee acknowledged the importance of previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Advanced Research Plans for Defence (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would be held, to identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to receive state grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that gets the best of academic space, it's companies," he said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired authorities from universities to work on artificial intelligence issues in recent years.
Lee argued that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that a green card should be automatically offered to holders of a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China issued an Artificial Intelligence Development Plan Next Generation in July 2017.
China's National Institute of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations respectively distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is inferior, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, in which partners from the business and academic world will join, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Science Foundation currently invests more than $100 million annually in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made in US legislation for months with the aim of creating a National Security Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonian citizens hold referendum to decide whether to change country's name
Macedonia's people participated in a referendum Sunday to decide whether the country would be renamed the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that had blocked the country's candidate for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, argues that the name of the northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether participation would reach the required 50 percent to validate the referendum.
The question on the ballot was this: "You are in favour of joining NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece."
The advocates of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to pursue membership of organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from Yugoslavia's collapse.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, so that young Macedonians could live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because so the lives of all of us will be safer," said Olivera Georgquievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, several members of parliament have stated that they will comply with the result of the vote, in order to make it final.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
The state election committee said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, attendance reached only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when it gave the present 66 per cent of registered voters.
"I came to vote for my children, our position is in Europe," said José Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Dusko voted in the referendum to change the country's name that would pave the way for the country's NATO and European Union membership of the Macedonian city of Strumika on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small scene and places chairs in front of scenes set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads high, not as second-class partners," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the Eurasian union."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring coveted investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate exceeding 20 per cent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a positive result would be "the confirmation of our future."
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, the referendum would involve between 30 and 43 percent of voters, i.e. less than the required participation.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian television station Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents planned to vote Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote positively.
For the referendum to be successful, participation must reach 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its rise to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Awero passes Brighton's entire defense to score goals
Sergio Awero and Rahim Sterling finished Brighton's defense by winning 2–0 for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Awuero seemed to score easily in the 65th minute.
Argentinian striker received a pass in midfield at the beginning of the phase.
He passed three Brighton defenders before pouring into the open space.
Awarero was then found surrounded by four green players.
He dribbled one defender, then escaping several others at the edge of Brighton's large area.
Then he passed to his left, finding Sterling.
The English forward made his first move in the area by returning the ball to Awero, who used his right leg to defeat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, scoring on the right side of the nets.
"Awero faces some problems on his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said to play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial advantage in the Battle of the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Awero received the ball deep in Brighton's area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball in his possession and led Sterling to the rear beam.
The blue forward kicked the ball into the nets just before it got out.
City faces Hoffenheim in the Champions League groups Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rain-Nekar Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Serzer wants to beat the Rockies.
As the Niasionals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to try to make another start.
But the always competitive Serzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for the Rockies in the playoffs, as they lead by a Los Angeles Dodgers game in the National League West.
The Rockies have spent at the playoffs with their 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to lock first place in their league.
"Even though we have nothing to gain, at least we can play by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will probably be a game of the highest level I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in such a race?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the original thrower on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let Serzer drop the ball.
Serzer, who will do his 34th launch, did coaching throws Thursday and will play Sunday, which is normally a rest day for him.
The right-handed from Washington has an 18–7 performance with an average winning points (ERA) of 2,53 and 300 out due to strike in 220 2/3 periods this season.
Trump holds a speech in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation regarding his selected candidate for the Brett Cavanaugh Supreme Court, in a speech on the importance of Republican participation in the interim election.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important electoral procedures in our lives.
This is a very important moment. I am not a candidate, but it is actually like being and, for that reason, I travel everywhere to support excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say: "You see this miserable, miserable radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they're determined to take power back using any necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to exterminate to take power and control, because what they want is power and control and we're not going to give them to them."
The Democrats, he said, have undertaken a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you've been seeing this for the last four days," he said, describing Democrats as "angrily and evil, miserable and liars."
He referred to the Senate Judicial Committee by naming Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, a report that was accepted with strong disapprovals by the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you reveal the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting for an answer, that was a really bad use of body language, the worst use of body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad party.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion.
I was not surprised at the fact that activists of the Movement of Modementum in my local group voted to put me on trial.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour Members to whom they have said that they are not welcome, precisely because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan has had a similar approach because she has resisted anti-Semitism decisively.
In my case, my motion of censure was criticized for arguing with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, paradoxically, for similar issues to those on which Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The invitation to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "we want our meetings to be productive with everyone's participation."
For most of the eight years I have been a local Labour Member, the meetings of the General Commission on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately, today, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more merciful, more compassionate" policy has long been forgotten if it ever really began to come true.
It is evident more and more often that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is accepted by the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I previously thought we had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and adopt views with which I would never agree, whether they were about national security or the EU single market.
Every time I spoke publicly, regardless of what I was really saying, I listened to a social media enthusiast, where some people asked for my rejection, they renounced the centre's policy and told me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than other colleagues, as the comments made to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults daily, but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time in politics is how insults are now considered normality.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad party and that with every motion of censure or change in the rules of choice, the party's boundaries are narrow.
I've been advised many times over the last two years not to stand up, not to talk too much, and that everything will be all right.
But I didn't go into politics to do this.
Since joining the Labour Party, 32 years ago, as a student still, due to the neglect shown by the Thatcher government which literally led to the failure of my entire class, my aim was to defend better public services for those who need them the most, either as a member of the local council or as a minister of government.
I never hid my policy, and so did I in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused in any way about my political views and my points of disagreement with today's leadership.
To those who promoted the motion of censure on Friday, all I have to say is that, while the country is faced with a Brexit that will hurt our households, businesses and public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I am loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, really, my only message is not addressed to members of the Momentum movement in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and promise that no threat of rejection or political expediency will prevent me from acting as I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ire - Melrose: 38 - 17: Unbeatable Ire climbs to the top
Two late goals may have somewhat twisted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ire deserved to triumph in this extremely entertaining current tennis league match.
It is now at the top of the ranking, the only undefeated team out of ten.
Eventually, it was her superior defense, as well as the best exploitation of opportunities, which raised the scales in favor of homeowners and coach Peter Murchi had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ire, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did."
Grand Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, converted by Frasier Clemo, brought Ire forward, but a yellow card to Scottish Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggot scored a goal without conversion.
Clemo increased Ire's lead with a penalty, before scoring, just at halftime, a conversion goal, leading Ire to the locker room with a score of 17–5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's goal, converted by Bagot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, who was removed by a stretcher, and, after the restart, Ire increased the difference with a Stafford McDowal goal, with Clemo's conversion.
Deputy chief Blair McPherson then took a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of Bruce Colvin's numerical advantage with no conversion goal, after a period of intense pressure.
The hosts came back, however, and, when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow tackle card to Clemo without the ball, from the penalty line, McPherson scored goals at the back of the attack launched by Ire.
Climate performed conversion, as it did again almost since the restart, after first Kylie Rowe picked up David Armstrong's kick and sent extrem Gregor Henry away for the fifth home goal.
Star of Still Game begins new career in focus
The star of the Still Game series Ford Kiernan shows ready to switch to the focus industry, after it was revealed that he has been appointed director of an licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, which he writes and in which he co-stars with his longtime partner in comedy Greg Hebfil.
The couple announced that the upcoming fifth cycle would also be the last of the show and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Gayland.
According to official records, he is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the information, although a Scottish Sun source implied that Kirnan wants to deal with the "growing branch of focus" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Enclosed Bolivia hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the fully equipped naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings they wave blue flags.
On the bases of the navy from Lake Titicaka to the Amazon is written the slogan: "The sea belongs to us rightfully.
It's our duty to get her back."
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline conquered by Chile after a bloody conflict over the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the longing of its people to travel to the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have risen more today than ever, for decades, as Bolivia expects the International Court of Justice's ruling on October 1st after five years of consultations.
"Bolivia has the dynamic, a spirit of unity and calm, and naturally awaits the result with a positive look," said Roberto Calzadila, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that The Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim to force Chile, after decades of fickle talks, to negotiate for Bolivia to grant Bolivia a dominant exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous President, who fights a controversial battle for his re-election the following year, has much to gain or lose from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia and that, even if it did, not much would change.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the power to give Chilean territories and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court is to be delivered just six months after the final arguments were presented suggests that the case "was not complicated," Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law issues, said.
And instead of further promoting Bolivia's objectives, last four years may have undermined them.
"The present Bolivian government has usurped the issue of access to the sea," Zarate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has exhausted every remaining good mood of Chile, he argued.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velje, a Bolivian representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually rapid.
On Monday Bolivia will have "an excellent opportunity to launch a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility to "end disputes of 139 years with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin American's most popular leaders, uses the issue of exit to the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea declares there will be no nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho states that his state will never disarm his nuclear weapons first, if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the heads of the two states.
Ri made these comments while U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seems ready to resume nuclear diplomacy that had reached a quagmire, three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Yong Eun.
Ri states that the view that continued sanctions and the U.S. refusal to declare the end of the Korean War will eventually force the Northerns to "kneel" is a summer night dream.
Washington hesitates to agree to issue the relevant declaration, if Pyongyang does not first make significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and the American President, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism as to whether Pyongyang is seriously considering disclaiming an arsenal which the country probably considers to be the only means to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in oversized hats that will soon be available in a store near you
If you want to raise your hat collection or avoid the sun completely, then stop looking.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented on the runway a series of bizarre oversized hats for their collection Spring-Summer 2019 which stole the performance at Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely uncomfortable hats flooded Instagram this summer and their designers sent their impressive creations to the runway.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was an oversized beige hat decorated with a broad boa with wings that completely covered the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories were presented watermelons decorated with gems, a magician hat, even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also featured a series of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and referred more to Hannibal Lecter than to high sewing fashion.
One creation brought to mind complete snorkeling equipment and glasses, while another looked like melted ice cream in a funnel.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with huge accessories, you're lucky.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could reach central shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats made their appearance very quickly after La Boba, the straw hat with the very wide one we've seen wear so many, from Rihanna to Emily Rataikovsky.
The popular firm that created the extremely uncomfortable hat that flooded social media sent another great creation to the runway, a wicker beach bag almost as large as the model that carries it wearing its swimsuit.
The dark orange rack bag, decorated with shelves crotches and a white leather handle, was the piece that stood out from Jacquemus' La Riviera Spring-Summer 2019 collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist, Luke Armitage, said in the FEMAIL column: "I expect to see large hats and large beach bags at the malls next summer, as the designer made such a great sense that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills Are Necessary to People of the World · Global Voices
Scotland's independent schools have a history of academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with yet another series of outstanding results in the exams, which were simply further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, which are represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Board (SCIS), struggle to provide the best service level possible to their students and parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and highest education levels, the professional careers they will choose and their position as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a school curriculum on demand, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable selection course in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you're talking to someone in a language he understands, then what you say goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say enters his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot simply rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's exams, we find that languages are at the top of the performance tables, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages achieved an A degree.
Evidence gathered from 74 SCIS members schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also had grade A.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages today, as a selection course, are considered as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics courses in independent schools and elsewhere.
A UK Employment and Skill Commission survey in 2014 revealed that, as regards the reasons why employers had difficulty filling job vacancies, 17 percent involved lack of language skills.
Therefore, the need to acquire language skills is becoming increasingly urgent so that young people are prepared for their future careers.
Since more future employment opportunities require language knowledge, these skills are necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future, because of this skill you can use throughout your life.
If one is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over competition.
According to YouGov's survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were unable to speak any foreign language well enough to have a debate, while French was the only language to speak a two-digit percentage of respondents (15 percent).
For this reason, investing in language teaching today is important for today's children.
Knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
For whatever your child is interested, there will always be some languages to choose from in independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scotland's independent schools loyally provide a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve, whatever the future holds for them.
One cannot deny today that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturality and excellence for Scottish youth.
They have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Board.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The expectation of fans eager to see Lebron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers came almost to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced James would play Sunday in the first game before the Denver Nuggets race season in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been decided how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James will probably play a few minutes.
After practice a few days ago, James was asked about his plans regarding the six-game program the Lakers have to give before the season.
"I don't need preparation matches at this stage of my career to prepare myself," he said.
Trump's gathering in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of gatherings starting in Willing, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five scheduled gatherings next week, including tours to friendly adjacent areas, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his choice for the Supreme Court on hold, Trump seeks to strengthen popular support for the forthcoming interim elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress with the November vote.
What time is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's gathering in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 pm ET Tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's gathering in West Virginia online below through live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to this week's hearings for the candidate for the post in the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, which were made in tense atmosphere due to allegations of sexual misconduct, with a Senate confirmation vote that has been put on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigation is underway.
However, the primary goal of this series of gatherings is to help Republicans who face a bilateral outcome in the November election in order to gain some momentum.
Thus, the staff of President Trump's campaign stated that these five gatherings next week aim to "mobilise volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to his agenda, that the president travels to as many states as possible, as we go to the busy period of the campaign," he told Reuters a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who wanted to remain anonymous.
The scheduled for tonight's gathering at Willing's Wesbanco Arena could bring supporters from " Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time within the month Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tries to help Patrick Morrissey, a Republican candidate in West Virginia for the Senate, who is low in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost to the polls," said Simon Henderson, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team has the courage to fight keeping hopes alive as it marches to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday afternoon fours might have been all this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely devised athletic idea, but players believe it deeply, and especially in such confrontations.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
"There were six points ahead and now four are ahead, so we probably have a little momentum," Jordan Spith said as he was leaving for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of leading by four points and remaining twelve more in the game.
Americans, as Spith says, feel the "air on their sails" and have much to encourage them, such as the twin Speed and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each gained three points out of four.
Spith was deadly from tee to green and sets the example.
The cheers of the celebrations became stronger as he continued his round, achieving a critical hit to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The hit with which they won the game on the 15th was accompanied by similar celebrations showing his belief that the American team is not out.
"You need to look deep inside and worry about your own game," said Spith.
It's what every player has left.
18 holes to make history.
The only players with more points than Speed and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's unquestionable story.
The strange but adorable duo of Europe has achieved four out of four and appears to be doing nothing wrong.
"Mollywood" was the only duo who did not hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and backmine on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way energy seems to flow to and from noisy spectators, seals the fact that it is the players that should win Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory while the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The debate on European glory remains premature.
Baba Watson and Webb Simpson put the glasses on Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he played alongside Alex Norén.
With a bogey and two doubles on the front Nine they shoved the Spanish and the Swede so deep into a hole they couldn't get out of it.
But Sunday, there will be no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so exciting matches to watch them closely due to interaction between couples, advice they give, advice they don't give and how a strategy can be changed in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant lead on the last day, but this foursome match also showed that the U.S. team has the guts, despite some doubts.
Europe takes the 10-6 lead on Ryder Cup's last day
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after its progress in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes 10-6 against the US.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a run with two wins against a struggling Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead in Le Golf National so far at four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, trying to preserve the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the missed American side in morning fourball, with a 3-1 streak.
The U.S. most resisted foursomes, winning two games, but were unable to catch up.
Jim Furick's side needs eight points out of Sunday's 12 single matches, to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer player to win four straight points, while along with Molinari, also known as "Mollywood", after a shocking weekend is only the second duo to win four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed at fourballs, they joined forces to destroy a tired Woods and American newly emerging Bryson DeShambo with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who crawled into the two Saturday matches, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven streaks.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning fourballs, returned to his teammate Henrik Stenson for foursomes with 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka, winning first and third place in the world rankings.
It did not go well for Europe, despite the pleasant, cool day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Speed and Justin Thomas set the bar for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a difficult 2&1 win over Spain's John Ram and Ian Potter at fourballs and returned later to defeat Potter and Rory McCilroy 4&3 at foursome while they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history a team was able to recover while losing with four points in the singles, although because it is the tropaeder, Furik is sufficient to score a tie to maintain the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, it appears that a counterattack Sunday is out of their reach.
North Korea says it won't be disarmed unilaterally without confidence measures
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that ongoing sanctions deepen the feeling of mistrust over the US and that his country will not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho stated at the annual general meeting of the global organization that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, e.g. the cessation of nuclear and ballistic tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing facilities and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US there will be no trust in our national security and under such conditions there is no way to unilaterally begin our disarmament."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korea complaints about Washington's resistance to the possibility of a "stepping" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded as it gradually progressed in the process, his statement was important in that it did not completely block unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to the joint announcement of Kim Yong Eun and Donald Trump at the first summit to take place between an acting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks to officially end the 1950–53 Korean war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first "deliver" its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls for relaxation of the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on becoming 'first denuclearisation' and increasing pressure by threatening sanctions to achieve their cause by blackmailing, putting obstacles even to 'the declaration of end of war'," Ri said.
"The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri made no mention of a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. chief pointed out to the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, however, pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If the partner on the issue of denuclearisation were South Korea rather than the US, denuclearizing the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
Even so, the tone of Ree's speech was very different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korean ballistic missiles was inevitable because "Bad President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, drew Kim's praise for his courage to move forward with disarmament measures, but said that much still needs to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for it, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it's okay."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensively and uninterruptedly until full, final and confirmed denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to counteract the funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He departed Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, for North Korea to denounce him a few hours later that he had "the demands of a gangster".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex, if the United States were to take "similar measures".
He clarified that Kim told him that the "reciprocal measures" he seeks were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and promoted the normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend classes on how to rest enough
This year, a new course at Harvard University seeks all undergraduate students to sleep more in an effort to combat the growing bunch of culture of overnight study by consuming a lot of caffeine.
An academic discovered that students at number 1 university worldwide often do not know basic things, e.g. how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chisler, a professor of medical sleep at Harvard Medical School and a qualified doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I just learning about this in my last year?".
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, first started this year, explains to students the basic principles on how good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as to improving general well-being.
Paul Bareira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to include the course when it was found that students were sleepless within the week to a significant extent.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is the image of a student dormitory, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books, to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by sleep shortages, as well as the importance of routine sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it will not change students' behavior directly.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke," Professor Chisler added.
His culture of boasting because you studied all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a problem that swells.
Enough sleep, good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of starvation, resulting in a lasting feeling of hunger.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and natural biology, helped Professor Chisler design the course, having attended one of his classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said his class opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a lesson across the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar program before starting their studies at this highly competitive educational institution.
Professor Chisler advised students to set up a warning for the time they should go to bed, as well as an alarm clock for the waking hour, and to know the harmful consequences of "blue light" emitted by electronic monitors and LED lighting, which can disrupt circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston - Rangers 1–0: Menga sets goals for Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad away loss, as Dolly Menga's shot led Stephen Gerard's disoriented side to a 1–0 defeat in Livingston.
Imbrox's team sought to mark its first win away from the February triumph by 4-1 in St.-Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerard's only second defeat to 18 games as coach, leaving the team eight points behind Harts, first in the Ladbrokes league ranking.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime and Rangers' uninspired roster seemed unable to retaliate.
While Rangers now falls to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, with just one goal difference from Hibernian leading.
And Rangers may be expecting more trouble, as Supervisor Callum Spence had to receive first aid for head injury caused by an object thrown off the platform.
Gerard made eight changes to the team's composition and defeated Eyre in the semi-finals for the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same lineup "Livy 11" that took a grade from Harts last week and would be happy with how this well-oiled machine of his was able to suppress all opponents' efforts.
Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute, when Menga's first long pass sent Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's area, but the midfielder did not find the ball.
A deep free shot by Keegan Jacobs found chief Craig Halket, but teammate Alan Lithgow's defender all he could do was send the ball away from the beam.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in the game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have won a penalty in 15 minutes, as he clashed with Stephen Lowles, but referee Stephen Thompson ignored Colombian's complaints.
Rangers only had two shots within the area in the first half, but former Imbrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was not at all concerned by Lasana Kulibali's headset and Ovi Ejaria's subdued shot.
Although in the first 34 minutes of the race Livy was clearly below expectations, no one can deny that she deserved the victory for the effort alone.
Still Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who maintained his temper and found Menga who simply completed the effort.
Gerard made changes in the half by taking out Kulibali and putting Ryan Kent. The change paid off almost immediately, as extrem passed the ball to Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran off his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to lure guests into the style of the game she knows and enjoys, with Lithgow and Halket pulling away one far ball after another.
Holt's side could have increased the difference towards the end, but McGregor faced Jacobs straight, stopping him before Lithgow's attempt from the corner.
Rangers' alternate, Glenn Middleton, had another penalty phase towards the end, as he clashed with Jacobs, but still Thompson ignored it.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Meter
A page from the almanac Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882: today, 136 years ago and VALE ... the day when future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hance" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, this invention eventually led to the device now known as the Geiger counter.
Pillar of science since, the Geiger counter passed into the sphere of pop culture, as in the 1950 film titled Bells of Coronado, starring the amazing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you hear the action of people caused by radiation in the metal elements."
Evans: "Look, he's acting crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention bearing its name continues its work.
New anticancer vaccine teaches immune system to "see" problematic cells
New anticancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" the problem cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to identify problem cells in the treatment framework
The method includes the extraction of immunocellulars from the patient and their modification to the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein that is common in various types of cancer and then re-infused.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the problem cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immunocellulose from the patient, their modification to the laboratory so that they "see" a protein common to many cancers, which is called HER2, and then the re-infusion of cells.
Professor Jay Berzowski, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine in our hands."
As Professor Berzowski explained, HER2 protein "is the driving force for the development of several types of cancer", such as breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon.
A similar approach in which immune cells are extracted from patients and then "taught" how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West defended Trump, wearing a hat with the MAGA motto, after his appearance on the SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was disapproved at the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an informal interview in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After presenting his third song for the evening, titled Ghost Town, during which he wore a baseball cap with the Make America Great Again slogan (To make America great again), he gave a raving recital against Democrats and repeated his support to Trump.
"Many times I talk to a white man and he says, "But how do you like Trump?
If I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL opened with a sketch in which Matt Damon starred, with Hollywood star mocking Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Christine Blazi Ford's complaints of sexual abuse.
Although not broadcast, the video of West's delirium was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to dissect West with this suspension.
Also, West protested to the public that they did not treat him well backstage because of his hat.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with the hat."
They bullied me!
And they say I don't know what's happening to me," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "I don't know what's happening to me; I'll wear Superman's cape, because that way no one can tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments were disapproved at least twice by the public and SNL's contributors seemed to be in a difficult position, Variety reported, with one person stating in the magazine: "In the entire studio there was funeral silence."
West was invited as a last-minute substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper McMiller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused several when he sang I Love It dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by Candas Turner, head of the conservative TPUSA group, which tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING IN THE HOLO".
However, the show's presenter, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "self and that's great."
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe embraces and utters ideology which is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now "the being previously known as Canye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Didi's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Didi.
Rapper Snoop Dog had changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course the legend of Prince music had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince (The artist once known as Prince).
Charge of attempted murder of a knife attack at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old was charged with attempted murder after a knife attack on a man at an eastern Belfast restaurant Friday.
The incident occurred in Balihakamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the D.A.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for the role of swordsman John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
However, the actor, 31, criticizes the stereotype of the bunch of hero, saying that such roles on the screen pass on the little boys the message that they should be tough to gain respect.
Speaking in The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit stated that "something is going wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity can be combated in #MeToo's time.
Kit, who recently married his co-star at Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted to having a "strong view" on the subject.
"Personally, now, I believe it a lot. "Where did we make the mistake with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the malelike characters it promotes.
He continued: "What is inherent and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they must display such behavior to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time.
Clearly something has gone wrong with our young people."
In the interview he also admitted that he does not intend to play in any prequel or sequel of Game of Thrones, after the series ended the following summer, saying "end to fighting and horses".
As of November, Kit will star in the revival of Sam Sheppard's True West project, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that his acquaintance with his wife Rose is the best he earned from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so she kind of gave me my future family and life from now on," she said.
Rose played Ygrit, John Snow's love repelled, the character played by Kit, in the Emmy-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new incidents
China announced an increase of 14% in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health services.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 were approximately 40,000 new cases reported.
In their overwhelming majority, the new cases were broadcast through sexual contact, marking a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was almost zero, as Chinese health officials had stated at a conference in Yunan Province.
However, compared to last year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains a common phenomenon.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sexual intercourse with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs, as part of the effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an executive leaked data from Republican senators, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
This Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters refuted the allegations that a staff member posted personal information of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmaker.
The Democratic MP of Los Angeles argued that claims were promoted by commentators and websites of the "long right".
"Lies, lies and even more terrible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Published information is reported to include home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and appears to have been published by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill environment during a Senate commission hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Brett Cavanaugh Supreme Court.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had interviewed Cavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was associated with Waters' office and published the data of a Waters staff member, The Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely untrue and gross lies," Waters continued.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been violated because of these fraudulent and false allegations, was by no means responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is a completely untrue and gross lie."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary, Ari Flasser.
"This denial is full of anger, Flasser wrote.
"This shows that he does not have the courage to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
He mustn't be impertinent.
He mustn't question the motives of the man who blames him.
He must be calm and calm."
Flasser seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by his critics of looking very angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to dethron Waters in the mid-election, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's real," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false allegations."
"We will do anything to find those responsible," he continued, "and answer for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to anyone and all my staff members."
Review of the film Johnny English strikes again - a subdued spy film with Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for brands of Brexit in every new British-style film and this seems to apply to this revival of the action-comedy franchise with a hero Johnny English, which began in 2003 with the Johnny English film and came back in 2011 with the Johnny English film: The Return.
Can this humorous self-saty on the subject of how obviously we're a mess to make the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, impotent Johnny English with his grumpy eyes was able to renew his license to screw up for the second time. His name states that he is a wider comedy creation designed for non-English-speaking film viewers.
It is, of course, the clumsy secret agent who, while pretending to have the glow and manners of a secret agent, brings a little to Clouseau, with a dose of "Mr. Bean" and something from the guy who played a single note on the music theme of the film The Roads of Fire at the 2012 London Olympic Games opening ceremony.
It is also based on the traveler and international mystery man that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's most forgotten television commercials, sowing chaos in his path.
There are one or two beautiful moments in this last J.E. movie.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propellers hit his helmet.
Atkinson shows his talent for comedy, however, humor is quite submissive and strangely extravagant, especially at the time when "seriously" film franchises such as 007 and Dangerous Mission now include several comic elements.
Humor seems to be addressed to children rather than adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English's crazy setbacks are not as inventive and related as Atkinson's silent-film sketches for Bean's person.
The eternal central issue is that Great Britain has a serious problem.
A cybertaker has infiltrated Britain's super secret online spy network, bringing out the identity of all British agents on mission, to the great disappointment of the agent in service, played by Kevin Eldon in a sadly small role for his range.
It is the last drop for a pompous and ambitious prime minister on the verge of collapse due to political anti-popularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this character reminiscent of Teresa May, but the script does not help her much.
Information consultants inform her that, as every active spy has been revealed, she should reinstate a decommissioned man.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as principal at some aristocratic school, but gives unofficial lessons for undercover agents: here are some fine scenes, as English offers a press espionage academy A Very Rock School.
English returns to Whitehall for urgent briefing and reunites with Buff's former and suffering partner, played again by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role in which Vicky Pepperdin is not fully exploited.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the blunder for His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, meeting the beautiful and fatal Buletova Benefit played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously fascinated by charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's technological suffering: threatening Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff start the Odyssey of their farce: disguised as waiters, set fire to a palliate French restaurant, cause chaos as they try to illegally board Volta's luxury yacht, and English causes anarchy as he attempts to use a virtual reality device to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All tricks are used in this last scene, but as lovely and baffling as it is, it continues to remind a little children's television.
Moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I wonder: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he's really going to be great with his talent?
Labour deny that they are considering a plan to work the British four days, but to be paid for a five-day period
Jeremy Corbin's Labor Party is to consider a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five-day work.
The party reportedly seeks the bosses of the companies to channel the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, giving them an additional free day.
Thus, employees will enjoy a three-day weekend, without a reduction in their wages.
Sources say the idea goes hand in hand with the party's economic agenda and plans in order to turn the scales in favour of workers.
The change to a four-day week was approved by the Labour Association Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected to announce a policy change before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is an ambition aligned with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not considered by the party."
The secretary of the shadow government, John McDonnell, used the last week's Labour conference, to develop his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he is determined to regain power from "unpersoned directors" and "winners" to utilities.
The shadow government secretary's plans also mean that today's shareholders in water companies may not get their entire share back, as a potential Labour government could make "retentions" due to suspected misdemeanors.
It also confirmed the plans to place workers on the board of companies and to create mutual participation funds to give 10% of private sector companies to employees who will receive annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy talk on the 60 Minutes show about whether the FBI investigation into Cavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question whether the agency's findings could affect some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview Sunday, Scott Pelley, a 60 Minutes show correspondent, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could dig out anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said on the way to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and asked him directly: "Did you do it?"
He was unmoved, determined, categorical."
However, Graham's vote seems to be not going to change.
"I have decided on Brett Cavanaugh and will need some explosive charge to change my mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blazi Ford.
"And whoever he's named can't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is Global Citizen Festival and how much has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a rich program and well-known stars, but also an equally impressive mission: the elimination of global poverty.
For the seventh year now, tens of thousands are predicted to flock to Great Lawn, Central Park as part of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event, which is to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of those actively fighting against it.
To secure a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), interested people had to complete a number of missions or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, calling or finding other meaningful ways to contribute to raising awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while there are still 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of reward with a free concert the right way to persuade our fellow citizens to take action or is it just another case of so-called "climaxtivism", that is, when some feel that they really make the difference by signing an electronic request or sending a tweet?
As of 2011, the Global Citizen group says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, promoting a series of different targets.
It states that these actions helped world leaders announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which are to affect the lives of over $2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements as a result of these actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that secured funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and implementers, who have undertaken "to help children make full use of their potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to eliminate malnutrition, having received over 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said Tracy Ulman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to the public during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following over 5,000 actions calling on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called The Power of Nutrition, addressed to 5 million women and children with dietary interventions.
Answering the question "What makes you think that we can eliminate extreme poverty?" included in the site's frequent questions,
a member of the Global Citizen community replied: "The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all major human rights movements and against apartheid before us, we will succeed, because united we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wicked, Sean Mendes, Cardie B and Janelle Mona are some of the artists to appear at this year's event in New York City, presented by Deborah-Lee Farnes and Hugh Jackman.
US may use the Navy for "exclusion" by blocking Russia's energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington may turn "if necessary" to its Navy in order to prevent Russian energy from being disposed of to markets, including the Middle East, as U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke revealed, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where it attempts at an invitation from the legitimate government, is a pretext for investigating new energy markets.
"I believe that the reasons why they are in the Middle East are that they want to sell energy, just as they do in eastern and southern Europe," he reportedly said.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to address Russian activity.
"The United States has the possibility, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, exclude them, to ensure that Russian energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees as part of an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group designated as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are essentially the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said referring to Russia with the designation of "a pain that knows only one trick", as it has an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made as Trump's administration has undertaken the task of strengthening exports of American liquefied gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, Trump's administration, including President Donald Trump himself, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuited" project for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a "captain" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a $11 billion budget project, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong resistance to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want," Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance provoked Germany's reaction, which stressed its commitment to the implementation of the project.
Germany's top organisation for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to abstain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for the presidency in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would seriously consider running for the presidency after the interim election.
At a meeting at Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she was considering the possibility.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our troubled government, and that's why they need a woman at the top," The Hill quoted him as saying.
"After 6 November, I will consider the possibility of a presidential nomination".
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the meeting, saying she "leads the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren did not chew her words about Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren stated that "of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote".
A poll published Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not believe that they should run for the Presidency in 2020.
58% of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% were in favour of such a nomination.
The poll highlighted more support for a possible nomination by former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a possible nomination and 48% against.
Other popular names from Democrats discussed in connection with a possible 2020 nomination are former vice president Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would have formally decided by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin referred to Trak Palin's Post-traumatic Stress Disorder at Donald Trump's meeting
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"With what my son has been going through since he returned, I can understand other families living with the effects of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and the injuries our soldiers carry when they return home," he told the public in the context of a concentration on Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "a bomb about to explode" and said of her son and other veterans that "they return a little different, return tougher, return wondering if there is respect for what soldiers, airmen and every other member of the army have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and gun ownership while in a state of drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies granting asylum to victims trying to escape gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted an amicus curiae report Friday in Washington supporting an asylum seekers to challenge politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August has not been revealed.
She stated that her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" abused her, however, U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
He was held in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come in the US, as countries facing severe problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision taken by the Immigration Appeal Commission (BIA) and allowed undeclared immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Carl Racine said Friday that the new policy " ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"In accordance with federal law, all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application; such an obstacle violates this principle," according to the amicus curiae report.
Lawyers also claimed in the report that policy refusing entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "are a necessary workforce."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration cases judges no longer to grant asylum to victims trying to escape domestic violence and gangs.
"The asylum is available for those who leave their country of origin due to persecution or intimidation due to race, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his statement on politics on June 11th.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems (even the most serious) people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palou, as the death toll doubles despite the struggle to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was getting worse all the time.
"It's very intense," said 35-year-old mother Riza Kusuma, trying to relieve her fever baby, at an evacuation center set up in the damaged city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances bring more bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Some residents attempted to return to their damaged homes and collect their belongings from the waters, trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake of the Richter scale, were unable to meet the needs.
Some injured, such as Dewey Harris, who suffered a fracture of the waist and shoulder, remained outside the Palos Army Hospital, where first aid was given to the countryside due to the ongoing strong aftershocks.
Tears flooded his eyes, as he told how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to be saved.
I was trapped in the wreckage of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence prevailed.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "intimidating" with "propagandist ads"
A week after official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a US daily newspaper advocating mutual trade benefits between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread its propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump reported last Wednesday in China Daily's paid insert appearing in Des Moines Register, the most-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to get involved in the Congressional election on November 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's charge that Beijing attempted to interfere in the American elections marked what US officials told Reuters is a new phase of the escalating campaign Washington has launched in order to exert pressure on China.
Although foreign governments are not prohibited from publishing advertisements to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an escalating trade war and have reciprocally imposed various tariffs on imports.
China's tariff reprisals at the beginning of the trade war were intended to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor with a long term term in Iowa, a state that is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hit the workers, farmers and businesses of America.
China, as Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "is engaged in this kind of intimidation by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"In the attempt to spread this propaganda, China's government exploits America's valuable tradition of freedom of speech and free press, publishing paid advertising to Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in Beijing stands, you will find few divergent voices and no true representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic progress, given that the media are under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers avoided offering to publish" his article, although it did not reveal which.
Republicans alienate female voters in the face of mid-elections due to the fiasco with Cavanaugh, analysts warn
As many top Republicans continue to defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh despite complaints of sexual abuse, analysts warn that there will be a reaction, especially from women, in the forthcoming mid-term elections.
Feelings about this issue are particularly tense and most Republicans have stated that they would like to go ahead with the vote.
These things cannot be restored," Grant Reier, professor of Political Science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University, told The Hill, regarding an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute move (R-Arizona) to request an investigation from the FBI will be enough to attract angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and they are certainly not going to forget it in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters rhythmically shouted the slogan "November Comes!" in the Senate corridor as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee gave the green light for Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazi Ford, Mic reported.
"The Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach record levels," Stu Rodenberg, an unbreakable political analyst, said on the news site.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29 who, while dislike the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which she detailed her allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts had predicted that there might be a reaction as long as Republicans proceed with the nomination.
"It's a huge mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote in committee or about the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put out. It's about how the Republicans handled the issue and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of the USA group that helps to elect Democrats pointed out on a news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who to believe after Fortn and Cavanaugh's statements, slightly more in favor of the second.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents certainly or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35% stated that he certainly or probably believed Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said he believed that Cavanaugh probably or certainly lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's move, the FBI undertook to investigate Ford's complaints and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee that Cavanaugh attacked her while he was drunk when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals while at a party, when both were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the World Web, begins a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The new subject of this technology legend is Inrupt, a company based on Berners Lee's open platform Solids.
Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored, as well as who will be able to access and which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "global domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about startup.
"It's a historic moment".
The application uses Solid platform technology allowing users to create their own "personal electronic data storage space" or a POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, lists of pending work, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of the data storage personal is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls this possibility "personal empowerment through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is the company to offer resources, processes and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company consists of Berners Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers who worked in the project and a community of code developers volunteers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Face and Google about whether they are allowed to make radical changes, overturning business models overnight.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a post on Medium released Saturday, Berners Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners Lee has been a strong voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the Internet," Berners Lee added.
Bernard Van: Honor Tax on a Clergy Who Received Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Anglican Church who has received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier was awarded his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Rev Bernard Van received the medal on 29 September 1918, for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had extracted the highest British military distinction.
On Saturday they became the unveilings of a commemorative plaque by his two grandsons, which was accompanied by a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the plaque unveilings became exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act for which he received the medal.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion to the St.-Kentin Canal amid very dense fog and while receiving strong fire from combat weapons and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the front line and with "extreme valor" led the line forward, before hitting alone with a battle weapon three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, nearly a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, stated that his grandfather's heroic actions were "something I know I could never reach, it's something that makes you feel unlimited respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also deposited a wreath after the parade, which was led by the youth philharmonic Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he "felt a great honor participating in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a genuine hero is proven by the support he has from many people."
MMA fans stayed up to watch Bellator 206, but saw Peppa the Pig
Think of this scenario: you have stayed up to watch the exciting Bellator 206, but they deprive you of the pleasure of seeing this unique sporting event.
The program in San Jose included 13 matches, including six on the main card, and would be aired live in the UK, from Channel 5, to the night zone.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing to go out into the ring, spectators in the United Kingdom were left shrewd when the show changed to Peppa the Pigunaki.
Some were not happy at all, as they had stayed awake until the early morning hours especially for the race.
A Twitter fan described viewing the children's program as "some kind of sick joke".
"According to the legislation, this content was not suitable for 6 a.m., so the children's program had to be aired," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior marketing and communication vice president, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Pig, yes".
Bellator's president, Scott Cocker, said they are to process the program, to include UK viewers in the future.
"If we think about the replays, I think we can make it," Cocker said.
"But it's six a.m. Sunday there and we won't be able to do it until Sunday, that's theirs Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the change took place, many messages were exchanged back and forth and were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't, it was because of the regulations.
I promise you next time that's not gonna happen.
We'll narrow it down to five games instead of six, as we usually do, we tried to offer more to the fans, and we went too far.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" due to his sexuality
The Olympic champion in diving, Tom Daley, said he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, however, this prompted him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he hadn't figured out by high school that they're not all like me.
Speaking to the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, she said she supported gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that since he became a parent, he is less interested in a victory at the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of the well-known radio show, was for several months on leave due to illness.
As a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "insufficient" compared to others when growing up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like someone and boys and girls."
He stated: "Until today, these feelings of inferiority and diversity gave me the strength and will to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't let anyone down when they eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist is a prominent defender of LGBTQ community rights and took advantage of his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal, so that more countries proceed to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he decided to talk, because he felt lucky that he could live openly, without consequences, and that he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said it was "a surprise" when he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married Oscar-winning Dustin Lance Black last year, who is 20 years older than him, but argued that the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such an early age" (he first participated in Olympics at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it is difficult to find someone of age who has similar good and bad moments."
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daly, and Daley said that he changed "all his perspective".
"If you asked me last year, all I wanted was to win the gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had made tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "Dad, you won't be near us to sit in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and was dead I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew it was all I'd dreamed of my whole life, fighting in the dives at the Olympics in my home country, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song, Heather Small's Proud, that encouraged him during his preparation for the Olympics and still gives him the creeps.
Desert Island Discs broadcast on BBC Radio 4, every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape Mikkelson will sit on the bench Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mikkelson will record a record Sunday, when he will play his 47th race at Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his performance so he doesn't remember him for the wrong reasons.
Mikkelson, who participates for the 12th time (number of records) in the games organized every two years, was forced by chief Jim Furick to sit on the bench for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he usually does for the United States, the five-time winner shared the day to cheer from the lines and "work" his game hoping to correct his problematic points.
Without ever having been the most straight driver even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old's game is not suitable for Le Golf National's narrow field, where the distants are often problematic.
And as if the difficulty of the stadium were not enough, Mikkelson, in Sunday's ninth race, faces Francesco Molinari, champion of the British Open, who is working with the first-time Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, which were four points below the start of the 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, Mikkelson's game may be crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he plays today, hit me friendlyly in the back, put his hand around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furick said.
"He's very confident.
His name is at Hall of Fame and has offered too much to these teams, both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't count him to play two games.
I was thinking more, but that's where we ended up, so we thought we had to go.
He wants to go out there, like everyone else."
Mikkelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Sunday games at Ryder Cup.
It could mean the end of a career at Ryder Cup that did not reach the height of its individual record.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furick said his presence had benefits for the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make jokes and he's excellent in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players were also having fun teasing him this week.
His contribution is not only in the game."
The leader of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the big lead may soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the leader of the European team, knows from his experience that a great lead starting from the last day's singles at Ryder Cup can easily be turned into defeat.
Dane made his 1997 Valderrama match debut, where a team led by Seve Balesteros managed to get an advantage of five points over the Americans, but he barely managed to cross the final line by breast difference, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama, we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but barely," Bjorn said, in the picture, after watching the 2018 generation win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and all the team members that this isn't over.
We're going all ready tomorrow to give it all away.
We're gonna go out there and play right.
Nothing's over until you see the grades on the board.
We have a goal to win this trophy, and that's where we focus.
I always say that I focus on our team's 12 players, but we know very well that in the other team there are equally good players – the best in the world."
Satisfied with his players' performance on a difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I wouldn't be in a hurry to pretrial the result.
Tomorrow is another beast.
Tomorrow's individual performance counts, and that's something different.
It's great to be on the field with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, then you're trying your best skills as a golfer.
This is the message you need to transmit to the players, how to get the best of themselves out tomorrow.
You leave your teammate behind and he has to give it all away and show his best self."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furick from the opposing team will ask his players to score better individual performance than they had along with their teammates, except Jordan Speed and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furik himself has experienced both ends of the last day's twists, as he belonged to the winning team in Brookline before the unexpected defeat, as Europe did its miracle.
"I remember every damn word of his," he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had rallied his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start as in Brookline, as in Medinah.
When we get that momentum, there's a lot of pressure in the middle games.
We decide our turn accordingly and we play in the order that suits us, we will try to do our magic tomorrow."
Thomas has undertaken to lead the match and faces Rory McMilroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Potter, the rest of the Europeans in the top half of the series.
"I went with this team in this order because I think it covers the entire route," said Bjorn justifying his options for singles.
New postponement for Germany's new warship
The German Navy's new frigate should have been put into service in 2014, to replace the aged warships of the Cold War era, but it will not be received by at least the following year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reports.
The position in service of the Rheinland-Pfalz frigate, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuertttemberg-class frigate, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which invokes a representative of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems with tradition were decisive for the fate of the ambitious plan.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
They will carry a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and missiles against ships, as well as some stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important characteristics are that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as it will be possible to use new frigates for up to two years outside German ports.
However, continuing delays mean that although warships are considered to be state-of-the-art, which will allow Germany to show its power abroad, until they are finally put into service, they will already be outdated, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate became headline last year, when the German Navy officially refused to pick up the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned ship to a shipyard after delivery.
There has not been much information known about the reasons for the return, but German media reported a number of significant "deficits with software and hardware" that would put the warship out of use if it were used on a combat mission.
The software problems were particularly important. as Baden-Wuertttemberg-class ships have a crew of about 120 sailors, only half compared to the older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship has much greater weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The frigate Rheinland-Pfalz of 7,000 tons is believed to have twice the weight of similar-class ships used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the cost for the entire project (including crew training) was also an issue.
It is said to have reached the dizzying sum of EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion), while the initial budget was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems that plague the new frigates are particularly important since Germany's naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy "will soon have no ships for missions".
The official said the problem swelled over time, because the old ships were decommissioned, but without any other ships to replace them.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Wuertttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
National Trust eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
New research conducted on an estate in the Highlands of Scotland seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting their food.
The findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and contribute to the design of future environmental protection actions.
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will explore the habits of the common nanonytter and micronytter, as well as Dobedon's brown bat and myotid in Inverewe Gardens gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the estate to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also perform mobile research using hand detectors.
Analysing the sound of all recordings by experts will ascertain the frequency of bat calls, as well as which species have this behavior.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be created to form a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, a natural environment protection consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly since the last century.
They are threatened by building work and development projects affecting the places where they roost and destroy their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting are also a danger, as are tape adhesives for flies and some chemical processes of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their prey.
They use an advanced sound-tracking technique to detect insects and obstacles in the course of their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, considers bats very important.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct regular investigations, inspect the places where bats roost and sometimes rescue them.
The organization has also created Scotland's first and only shelter exclusively for bats on the Threave estate, Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten species of bats live.
The estate manager, David Thompson, states that the estate is the ideal ground for bats.
"Here in Threeve we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many large trees and an ideal habitat.
There is still much we do not know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to increase their populations."
It emphasises that it is important first to check for bats before any maintenance work in dwellings, as the destruction of a single nest with small ones could kill up to 400 females and small ones, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Bats are protected species and it is forbidden to kill them, harass them, or disturb their privacy, or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an executive of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland encouraged the public to offer his help.
He said: "There is much left to learn about our bats and many of our species we just don't know the evolution of their population."
Ronaldo denies rape complaints, as his lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape complaints against him as "fake news", saying some "want to self-pronounce" by taking advantage of his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
National Portugal and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman named Katherine Majorga, in the room of a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
According to the complaint, she allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence and not mention anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers after the complaint, Ronaldo, 33, described the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is make news," said the five-time Golden Ball winner on camera.
"They want to project themselves and take advantage of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
I am happy and all is well," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations he published, which they described as a "unacceptable mention of rumors touching privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Skerts said the player would seek compensation for "a moral damage to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting them at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room, where she was allegedly raped rather than nature according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" by a "good guy", but he was betrayed by the other "one percent".
The documents say Ronaldo admits to having sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Majorga also claims she went to the police and to a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement, because she was "fearing the possibility of retaliation" and worried about her "public humiliation".
34-year-old says she is trying to overturn the settlement, as she continues to suffer from post-traumatic syndrome due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of getting a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of alleged abuse and this summer switched to Italian Juventus securing an agreement of 100m euros.
Brexit: UK "will regret forever" the loss of car companies
The United Kingdom "will regret forever", if it loses its reputation as a global leader in the car industry after Brexit, said Minister of Operations Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its Bernaston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car industry stated that the impact of cross-border delays in the case of Brexit without an agreement could cost jobs.
The factory in Bernaston, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis models are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU in late March, production at our factory will be discontinued," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's CEO in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have expressed fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has stated that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to risks to the supply chain according to car manufacturers in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line follows just-in-time. Spare parts reach every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars manufactured on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be problems at the border, resulting in delays and lack of parts according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, therefore production would cease.
Mr Clark said Teresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU "is specifically attempting to resolve the issue of cross-border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want the best deal possible that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today show.
"The evidence that comes not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that it is necessary to ensure continuity of supply chains".
Toyota was unable to say how much diamonds would stop production, however, warned that in the long term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and is the union manager of Unite at the factory, said union members are increasingly concerned: "From my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A spokesman for the government said: "We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may "delay another week", as the dispute over the candidate in the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, announced the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian intervention in the election, Trump's assistant connections with Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump would fire the Deputy Attorney General, endangering Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a wire to record his talks with Trump and making it possible to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refused the report.
However, last Monday he went to the White House amid reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, then at the United Nations Organization in New York City.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order not to coincide with the hearing before the Senate Judicial Affairs Committee in which both Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazi Ford testified.
On Friday Trump instructed the FBI to conduct an investigation within a week of allegations against Cavanaugh, thus further delaying the holding of a vote by the Senate plenary.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's spokesperson, appeared on the Fox News Sunday television show.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "A date has not yet been set, perhaps it will be this week, but perhaps another week of data of all other cases dealt with by the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, after all, I like to always inform the guy."
Some journalists have refuted this claim: Sanders has had a press briefing to hold in the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why this is happening.
Sanders replied that the limited frequency of the updates was not due to a dislike of television journalists' "impression" movements, although she said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are being displayed."
He then implied that it would increase or directly communicate between Trump and the press.
"The President gives more interviews than any previous president," he said, adding without quoting evidence: "We looked at these numbers."
Updates will continue to be carried out, Sanders said, but "if the press has the ability to address questions directly to the President of the United States, this is incomparably better than talking to me.
We try to apply it often and you have seen that we have been doing it often in recent weeks and it will take the place of press briefing where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often receives questions when leaving the White House or participates in open meetings or press interviews with official visitors.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably proved why this is happening, with an unconventional and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled journalists.
Health Minister sends a letter to EU citizens working in Scotland's National Health System amid fears about Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU citizens employed in the Scottish National Health System to express the country's gratitude and to wish them to remain after the UK left the European Union.
Jean Freeman, a Scottish MP, sent a letter while fewer than six months remain for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of permanent resident status applications ("settled status") for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Mrs Freeman wrote in her letter: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued and are on their way to expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario of not reaching an agreement.
I know that this period must be particularly difficult for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee regardless of nationality.
Fellows from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christyon Abercrobby undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
The team defender Tennessee State Tigers Christyon Amberroby underwent emergency surgery after a head injury in Saturday's race, where Tennessee State Tigers were defeated 31–27 by the Vanderbilt Commodores, as broadcast by newspaper reporter Tennessean, Mike Organ.
Tennessee State Rod Reid's main coach told reporters the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came towards the bench and just collapsed there," Reid said.
The gymnasts and medical staff gave Abercrobby oxygen on the bench and then put him on a stretcher and carried him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State executive told Chris Harris from WSMV television station in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrobby came out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is no "still evidence regarding the type/expansion of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Ambercrobby, a sophomore student under a limited membership status ("redshirt"), is going through his first season at Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, thus reaching 18 total tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp fee for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp fee for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, while additional money will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tories plans
The measure will counteract Corbin's campaign's success to attract young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will be imposed on those buyers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million per year - to assist the homeless
Foreign buyers will start imposing a higher stamp fee on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, while additional money will be used to help homeless people, as Teresa May will announce today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to counteract the success of Jeremy Corbin's campaign to attract young voters with promises of providing more economic housing and targeting the high-paid.
The increase in the stamp fee will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, while the additional amounts will strengthen the government's campaign to combat housing shortages.
The increase, imposed on the current stamp fee, along with the highest tax rates introduced two years ago for buying second dwellings and rented dwellings, may amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to yield up to £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by people who do not reside in the United Kingdom, leading to price increases and making it more difficult for first-house buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy is introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp fee, in order for more young people to be able to obtain their first residence.
He accused the major construction companies of keeping property prices high, but acquiring land without using it and called on Mrs. May to abolish the ceilings in financial housing in order to restore Britain's "sacred shame".
Mr Corbin announced a series of impressive proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and a ban on evictions of "irresponsible".
He also wishes to give greater powers to councils in order to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream - to improving life for every new generation.
And that means repairing the broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a life here.
However, it would not be right for people who do not live in the UK and companies based abroad to buy homes as easily as hardworking British nationals.
For too many people the dream of housing ownership has now become too far away and the indignity of housing shortage remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to coach the Scottish team"
Sunderland's leader, Jack Ross, states that "his ultimate ambition" is to eventually become coach of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is thrilled with the challenge of resurrecting the northeastern England team, which is currently in third place in England's Third Football Division (League One), three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer, after previously bringing St. Miren back to the Scottish Championships the previous season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I received a call for the second national team and that was it," Ross told the BBC, Scotland, on the Sportsound radio show.
"But I grew up watching the Scotland team in Hampden all the time with my dad as a kid, and that's something that always drew me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I succeed in training teams."
Among Ross' predecessors in Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet, and Paolo Di Canio.
Former Aloa Athletic coach says he did not feel awe when he was invited to succeed such established names on such a large team, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this moment the success for me will be measured based on the answer to the question "can I reinstate this team to the Premier League?"
Due to the structure and facilities of this group, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy job to get her there, but I'll probably consider myself successful here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross began his career as a coach just three years ago, having spent a time as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Harts coaching staff.
He then helped Aloa return from relegation to the third division and led St Miren from the brink of relegation to winning the Championship the following season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St. Miren and Hamilton Akademical.
"It was rather a real crossroads," he said recalling the taking over of Aloa's coach position.
"I really thought it suited me more to be a coach than a player.
It sounds weird because I was doing good, I was making decent money out of it and I'd gotten pretty high.
But playing can be hard.
You have to endure a lot on a weekly basis.
I'm still having trouble with work stress and pressure, but the coach's job fits me perfectly.
I've always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I've felt with myself in my whole adult life."
You can listen to the entire interview on the Sportsound show Sunday, September 30, at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 British Summer Time
The best time for beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to an investigation.
The summer heat boosted profits for Britain's tested pubs but brought greater pressure on restaurant chains.
The pubs and bars experienced a 2.7 per cent sales increase in July, but restaurant profits declined by 4.8 per cent, as figures revealed.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consulting company, who collected the data, said: "Continual sunshine and the largest of England's expected participation in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern to last month, in June, where pub profits increased by 2.8 percent, but restaurants suffered an even greater blow.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant revenues in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars serving alcohol did far better, with the corresponding figures of previous years rising more than the corresponding restaurant data fell.
Food - serving pubs also suffered in sunny days, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In all managed pubs and bars, liquor sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales declined by three percent."
Paul Newman, from RSM's leisure and hospitality analysts department, said: "These results verify the trend we have seen since late April.
The weather and influence of important social or sports events remain the biggest factors in sales on the outside market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, but the fall in sales by 4.8 percent annually will be particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have appeared at a worse time for businesspeople in the focus area and time will show whether the lower temperatures we experienced in August will give a coveted extension."
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, rose to 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand name launches.

One out of five children keep secret accounts on social media, secretly from their parents
As research reveals, one out of five children - even 11 years old - maintain secret accounts on social media, secretly by their parents and teachers
Research into 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in false pages ("fake Insta") on Instagram
This news intensified fears that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of the students said they have a "main" bill to show their parents
One out of five children - even 11 years old - create accounts on social media, which they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake "fake Insta" accounts – this is a reference to the Instagram photo notification website.
This news intensified fears that sexual content is posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they maintain a healthy "main" account to show their parents, while maintaining private accounts at the same time.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, tracked down a teenage girl who urged others to rape her ("rap me").
The survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of School Directors and Directors (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of students from 11 to 18 years of age had two profiles, while half of them admitted to keeping secret accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers succumb to the temptation to create online sites where their parents and teachers cannot track them."
Eileen Doyle will be the "sporter's voice" on the Scottish track board
Eileid Doyle was elected as a non-executive councillor to the Scottish track board at the annual general assembly of the managing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most prized track athlete and President Ian Beatty commented on her election as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to take advantage of her wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eileen enjoys infinite respect throughout the Scottish, British and global track community and we are confident that the track in Scotland will have a huge benefit from its entry into the council," Beaty said.
Doyle said: "I am thrilled to be the voice of athletes and I hope that I can indeed contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the gold medal in 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, having won a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular commentator at the BBC, was paralyzed after a transient ischaemic stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time will tell whether to recover.
It was exhausting, but I fully recovered, I learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thanks for the encouraging messages!"
Breast advertising comparing mothers and cows divides online public opinion
A suckling company has divided online public opinion with an advertisement comparing suckling mothers with milking cows.
In order to launch the so-called "globally first silent and wearable breast-feeder", the consumer technology company Elvie released a humorous advertisement inspired by video clips to highlight the freedom that the new breast-feeding mothers offer.
Four real mothers dance inside a hay-filled cow barn, with a song that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you didn't notice, these aren't masts, they're my tits."
The choir continues: "Pull it, pump it, feed babies, pump it, pump it, milk my ladies."
However, advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, has raised online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, as many say it does not take the milk industry's horror seriously.
"Very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their own babies steal them a few days after birth," someone commented.

Another commented: "Obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah, why don't we use them to advertise breast implants for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "An advertisement completely out of reality."
Others defended advertising, while one woman admitted that her song seemed "unheartening".
"I think it's a very smart idea.
I'd buy such a breast if I were still breast-feeding.
The pumping made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I didn't get to over-analyze it.
It's a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad aimed at moms who pump breast milk (often in their workplace or toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the milk industry."
At the end of the video the women's team reveals that they all danced with the distinctive breast-feeders stuffed into their bras.
Logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who pump breast milk say they feel like cows.
The Elvie breast-feeder, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move, hold their babies and even go out during the pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and Executive Director of Creative in Mother, commented: "The Elvie breast-feeder is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a bold and challenging launch.
Making a parallel between lactating women and milk cows, we wanted to put the focus on pumping breast milk and all the challenges it involves, while showing in a fun and related way the incredible sense of freedom that the new breast will bring.
It's not the first time that the Elvie breast-feeder has become a headline.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for fashion designer Marta Yakubovski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in custody has reached heights, although the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration made it harder to match children with dependants.
Traditionally, most dependants themselves are immigrants without travel documents and are afraid to step out and ask for a child and thus endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk was intensified in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential dependants and other adult members of their household should give fingerprints and that the data would be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, senior employee of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to support unaccompanied minors.
Later the agency confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had a white criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of those who are either dependent or members of the maintenance household are in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," said Mr Albens.
Aiming at the quickest handling of children's affairs, the officials introduced new rules according to which some of these children should appear before a court within a month of the start of their detention and not within 60 days, as was previously the case, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear through videoconferencing, in place of self-faced appearance, in order to develop their allegations of granting legal status before the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to qualify for discharge will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to be nervous or distressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to shelter workers and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates said these concerns are intensifying in larger facilities such as Torniyo, where indications that a child is having difficulty are more likely not to be perceived because of the size of the facilities.
They added that moving children into the tent without giving enough time to prepare children psychologically or to say goodbye to their friends can exacerbate the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "occupiation forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will receive proper treatment."
"They must retire immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions of others have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight this sacred battle until we drive all Syrian terrorists away" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and inform both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of the war-ravaged country.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said that conditions are good for their return and accused "some western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay away from their country.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicize an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union warned that no aid would be given for the reconstruction of Syria unless a political agreement was reached between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a demilitarised zone in the last major stronghold of the rebels in Indlib created an opportunity to promote political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented an extensive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military actions would target jihadists, including warriors from the Al-Qaeda-related Nusra Front, who would "be neutralized".
UN special envoy Stafan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war Constitution for Syria and prepare the way for elections.
Mualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited "to the revision of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned that no interference should be made.
'Cause Trump's gonna win a second term.
With this logic, Mr Trump will win the 2020 election again, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the motion of censure and scandals prematurely end his presidency.
Something that would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic presidency finale of all time!"
So far there is no evidence of spectator fatigue.
As of 2014, ratings in the high ratings zone have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled, reaching 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the high ratings zone, while four years ago it had 1.7 million, according to Nielsen and MSNBC's show "The Rachel Maddow Show" has scanned ratings on satellite television, with 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
It's a fire people are attracted to because it's something we don't understand," Neil Baer, producer of ABC's drama series "Designated Survivor" (Survivor of the Next Day) where a minister becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovel, a veteran comedy series screenwriter and author of the book entitled "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
He remembers a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
Her driver said she was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked, "Why?"
"Answer 'Cause She Makes Me Laugh'," Mrs. Scovell told me.
One can even have fun with chaos.
Of course, contrary to what is happening with television series, scripts coming out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy v. Wade case, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite the health of the global economy.
Frequency change is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can enjoy.
And yet, you exceed the definition of the informed citizen when you are for six hours watching a team of experts discuss the use of "very long interviews in the background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear" ("Fear"), Paul Manafort's bottle jacket of ostrich leather worth $15,000 ("a garment full of hybrids", according to the Washington Post) and the consequences of the colorful descriptions made by Stormy Daniels about Mr Trump's anatomy.
Well, I'll never see Super Mario again the same way.
"What he does and that gives you the feeling of reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Pown Stars" television program, about constantly alternating actors and everyday twists in Trump's plot of performance (starts fighting with N.F.L., praises Kim Yong Eun).
You can't afford to miss an episode, otherwise you stay behind.
When I met with Mr. Fleish this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees Celsius outside his house on the north coast of Kawai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He could not get away, not when Brett Cavanaugh was to attend the Senate Judicial Affairs Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging by a thread.
"I remember doing those crazy shows back in the day and people were saying, "This will mean the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleis said.
"I thought it was some joke, but it turns out they were right after all."

External money flows into the most marginal race for the mid-election
It is no surprise that the 17th Pennsylvania constituency in Congress receives a cash flow, thanks to the re-alignment of congressional constituencies, which put two active members of Congress candidates for the same position.
This newly redesigned Pittsburgh suburban district is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who was elected to another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb rivals another active representative, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who represents the former 12th Pennsylvania constituency, which coincides largely with the new 17th constituency.
The maps were redesignated following a decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that he judged in January that the old districts were being manipulated unconstitutionally for the benefit of Republicans.
The election confrontation in the new 17th constituency sparked a financial competition campaign between the parties' largest financial segments, the Congress Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after achieving a limit victory in a special election match held in March, for the 18th Pennsylvania constituency in Congress, which was attended by a lot of people.
This position was held by Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political analysts give the Democrats a slight lead.
The United States examined the possibility of punishing El Salvador for its support in China, but backed back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, causing mild reactions from Washington.
Mr Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and was maintaining a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's administrative team.
State Department officials decided to recall the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions no longer to recognize Taiwan," Heather Neuert, the agency's spokesperson said earlier this month.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, estimated to have received around US$140 million as US aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country, with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings developed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, as a follow-up to a corresponding gathering that took place last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the migration of refugees to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administrators made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead, effectively ending the sanctions in El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, in an indication of the great importance the concentration has for management, as diplomats said.
All three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesperson on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal consultations, subject to anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst located near the administration, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Read History
The next blow may be the report by special adviser Robert Mueller on obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, for which very strong evidence has now been made public.
It is rumored that Mr Mueller is also turning his research into collusion between Mr Trump's campaign and Russia in relation to the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable before this body, as he prepares to claim the presidency again in the next election and perhaps eventually before an jury.
"If" is a lot and I do not imply that the fall of Mr Trump, nor of his bonds in Europe, is inevitable.
There are options that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will judge the duration of this battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the uncontrollable course of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since he was written in that newspaper that last year he suggested that the president be secretly recorded and that he considered him unfit for the president's position.
Mr Rosenstein said the version adopted by the Times is inaccurate.
"How are we going to answer if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Cavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite valid allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-election for a Congress that will put Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But, because of the lesson I took in Thing, I think we're not gonna fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew transferred to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later he sent me to light Jewish Saturday candles at that swastika table.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, senior executive at Brookings Institution, is the president of the Citizens for Response and Ethics organization in Washington (Civil Movement for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington) and the author of the book "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House."
Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the battle with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers welcomes Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning over Austrians, after the impressive tie in Spain with Villareal earlier this month, will give her much chance of qualifying from the 7th Europa League Group.
A knee injury prevented medium Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season until the 2–2 tie to Villareal, but believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard for greater hits.
"It was a good time for us because Villareal is a good team," said 31-year-old.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and came out with a degree.
Perhaps we could escape in the end, but, in general, the tie was a rather fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were a better team in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another big European night.
Good of things, we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they brought good results to their last game, but, with the world on the platform, I'm sure we can do our best and bring a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, due to my injuries and the changes made to the team itself, but there is a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids enjoy it, the practice is good.
Let's hope we can do our best now, leave behind last season and succeed."
Women lose their sleep because of their fear of pension savings
Although research participants had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few discussed it with their family.
Almost half of the participants in Nationwide's research said they are discussing with their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they have spoken about this to their children.
"People want their family to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to have the relevant conversation," said Holly Schneider, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Start with that.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care unless you express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these options may be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care can include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance at a redemption price to help you cover these expenses or self-security with your own property – as long as you have the money.
Draft your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make a healthcare attorney to appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the possibility of making a proxy for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make decisions on economic matters on your behalf and to ensure that your accounts are paid if you become helpless.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an emergency health problem and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Refer to these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just economics, but also who are doctors?" Martin asked.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make sure you prepare this plan."
Man received multiple fire with airgun in Ilfracombe
A man received multiple fire with an airgun as he walked towards his home last night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon County, when he received gunshots to the chest, abdomen, and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 02:30 British Summer Time, as a "accidental event".
The victim didn't see the attacker of the attack.
The injuries he suffered are not life-threatening and the police appeal for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With communications interrupted, humanitarian aid forces have failed to obtain information from Dongala, an area to the north of Palos, which is closer to the focus of the magnitude 7.5-point earthquake of the Richter scale.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were removed after the disaster broke out.
Here are some important elements concerning Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit it.
Dongala is a regency extending along more than 300 kilometres (180 mi) of coastline to the southwest of the Sulawesi Island.
The regency, a tier of administrative division under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main proponents of the province's economy of central Sulawesi and especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is most found in Morowali, across the Sulawesi coast.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Response Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit western Dongala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia lies within the earthquake ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is often hit by earthquakes.
Some of the largest recent earthquakes and tsunamis are as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Atcheh Province, Indonesia in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, while over half were in Achech.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late May and early April.
Hundreds of dead on Nia Island, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake on the Richter scale hit the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake on the Richter scale with a focus near the city of Pantang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 points of the Richter scale struck one of the Medaui Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of 10 meters tall, which destroyed dozens of villages and cost life to about 300 people.
2016: Low focal depth earthquake struck the Pinty Jaya area in Achech, causing destruction and panic, as it brought to the world memories of the destruction sown by the deadly earthquake and the 2004 tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but over 100 people were killed by buildings that fell.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Lobok tourist island in Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's firstborn son was arrested for domestic violence
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and candidate for vice presidency Sarah Palin was arrested for assault.
29-year-old Palin, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect in domestic violence, obstructing a complaint of domestic violence and resistance against the principle, according to the report published on Saturday by police (Alaska State Troopers).
According to the police report, when an acquaintance of his attempted to call the police to report the crimes he allegedly committed, he grabbed her phone out of her hands.
Palin is temporarily detained at the Mat-Su temporary detention store, with a $500 guarantee, as reported on KTUU television station.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he stated "sure, innocent" when asked, as the network reports.
Palin faces charges of three Class A misdemeanors, which means he can be sentenced to up to one year in prison and a $250,000 penalty.
He is also charged with a misdemeanor of category A, punishable by a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time a criminal prosecution has been brought against Palin.
In December 2017 he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been brought before the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of a complaint over the criminal offence of domestic violence and possession of a weapon, while intoxicated.
His partner claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016, when she associated her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic anxiety disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake of the Richter scale caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been discontinued, while the number of dead is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake struck near the central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media has been releasing videos from the moment of the catastrophic event.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach celebration in the town of Palos when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors are calling for the rarely imposed death penalty for the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the imposition of a death penalty on Saifoul Saipof, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that cost the life to eight people – a rare punishment that has been imposed on the state for federal crime since 1953.
Shaipof, 30, reportedly used a rental truck of Home Depot company to conduct an attack on a bicycle road along West Side Avenue in Lower Manhattan, drifting pedestrians and cyclists found on his way on October 31st.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Shaipov killed the eight victims "with intent" and caused heavy physical harm "with intent", according to the statement of intent to impose the death penalty, filed at the Court of the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges bear the death penalty, according to the document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury brought Shaipof up against the 22-point indictment, involving eight counts of homicide in favor of a criminal organization, a tactic often applied by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation" the prosecutors said, describing the way Shaipof performed the attack as "abominable, cruel and vile."
"Saiful Habibulaevich Shaipof caused pain, harm and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's families and friends, Nicholas Cleves, An-Laur Dekant, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferucci, Ernan Diego Mendossa and Alejandro Damian Panuko," as quoted in the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the South District Court of New York prosecuted a case that carries the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was imposed on a federal case in New York was in 1953 on the husbands Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage in favour of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Shaipov, a Uzbek national, seemed unrepentant in the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
He told the interrogators he felt satisfied with his act, according to the police.
Shaipof told authorities he was inspired to perform the ISIS video attack he saw on his cell phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to set up the ISIS flag in his hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges recorded in the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public advocates representing Saipof, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the imposition of a death penalty instead of accepting the statement of guilt for life imprisonment with no chance of release will only prolong the trauma caused by the events for all involved," Patton said.
Shaipof's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to request the imposition of a death penalty.
Tories MP says Nigel Faraj should be put in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest rally at the Tories conference.
Former UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader said politicians had to "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics, as one of Teresa May's MPs said he should be the head of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would already have come out" by now if Mr Farage were the Minister responsible for Brexit.
But the challenge facing Mrs May in trying to reconcile her deeply divided MPs was underlined by the fact that supporters of EU residence Tories participated in a separate rally of protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep the Chekers compromise plan under control amid attacks by Brexit supporters, advocates of EU and EU residence.
The allies insisted on moving forward with her attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the reactions and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and the 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone told the protest gathering Leave Means Leave (Department means Departure) in Solihal that he wanted to fly "the Chekers plan".
He said that he should have been awarded a title of courtesy to Mr Farage and had been given powers to negotiate with Brussels.
"If we were in charge, we'd be gone by now," he said.
The congressman from Wellingboro added: "I will support Brexit but we must throw away the Checkers plan."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to become vassals.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bone rejected the allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The assumption that the British people have changed their mind and wants to stay is completely untrue."
Brexit MP for the Tories Andrea Jenkins was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Checkers plan does not have the acceptance of the wide public, the Opposition will not vote for it, it does not have the acceptance of our party and our activists who go down the streets and after all elect us.
Please leave the checkers plan and start listening."
With a sharp message to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the protest rally that politicians should be forced to "feel pressure" if they are preparing to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"There is now a question of trust between us - the people - and the order of our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "we won't let you get away with it if you do that."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the order of our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, to feel the pressure.
"We are moving the people's army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the supporters of EU residence protested in Birmingham before holding a two-hour gathering in the city centre.
Few activists aired Tories banners against Brexit after gathering the teams this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives because of the security issues they faced with an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"It is the same people who tell us that they can put into effect the information systems and all the technological means needed for the EU-type Agreement – Canada with enrichment, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute fiasco.
It doesn't mean good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for the presidency
US Senator Elizabeth Warren states that she will seriously consider running for the presidency after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Republican senator spoke of her future plans during a gathering at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, claims her re-election in November, against Republican state representative Jeff Dil, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is strongly speculated that it can compete with Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event was her 36th meeting with voters making use of city hall structures since Trump's term began.
A rally attendee asked her if she was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is time "to go to Washington women to make our broken government and that means that a woman must be at the top."
Arrest for the deadly shooting of the LSU Sims basketball player
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect for the deadly shooting of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police station announced the arrest of Deton Simpson, 20 years old, at a press conference at 11pm (Eastern Time Zone).
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man seen in the video.
20-year-old Simms was fatally shot near Southern University site early Friday.
"Wade Sims suffered a bullet wound to the head, leading to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to the 247sports website network.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the point with a gun in his possession and confessed to shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without any resistance and is held in the East Baton Rouge District Police Department.
Third-year student Simms with a height of 1.98, raised in Baton Rouge played 32 matches, with 10 appearances as a key player in last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton goes for a world title, as his team's instructions gave him the victory over Sebastian Fetel
It became clear from the moment Walter Botas passed in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team's orders would play an important role in the race.
At the beginning Botas had a good start and almost hung Hamilton, as he defended his position in the first two turns and called on Fetel to attack his omen.
Fetel went first to the pits and let Hamilton run in the race line, which should be decisive.
Mercedes went into the pits one round after and came out behind Fetel, but Hamilton came out ahead after a wheel-to-wheel battle, which forced Ferrari's driver reluctantly abandon the interior due to a risk of falling into the double move violation to defend the third corner.
Max Ferstapen started from last place and was seventh at the end of his first round on his 21st birthday.
He then remained first for a large part of the race, as he held his tires aiming to finish quickly and pass ahead of Kimi Rykonen in fourth place.
He eventually went to the pits in the 44th round, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, as Rykonen came fourth.
It's been a long day because Walter was fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did great and did one or two," Hamilton said.
Body language was very bad
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a gathering Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasie Ford's letter, in which he accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a gathering in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Judicial Affairs Committee, commenting instead that the incident in the Senate proved that people are "poor and miserable and liars."
"The only thing that could happen and this beautiful thing that's been happening in the last few days in the Senate, where you see anger, you see people who are angry and mean and miserable and liars," he said.
"When you see posts and leaks and then they tell you "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you make the leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document-- "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a minute.
If we leaked...No, we didn't leak," he added by imitating the senator.
Feinstein received Ford's letter containing details of the charges against Cavanaugh in July and she leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak was made by her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported in the Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to keep her secret and I kept her classified as she asked."
But her refusal did not seem to convince the president in particular, who commented during Saturday's meeting: "I will tell you something, the body language was very bad.
He may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was charged by three women for sexual harassment, the president implied that Democrats use the charges to serve their own purposes.
"They are determined to take power back using any necessary means.
You see maliciousness, misery, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample on to get power and control," the president said on the Mediaite news site.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars took atonement for her defeat in Friday's race in Elite League to Belfast Giants, winning the 5–3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an easy lead with two goals with a shot by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviyer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan County brought the tie for the hosts before Dwight reinstated the Giants' lead.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee and then two goals by Lucas Ludwald Nielsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third defeat to Elite League within the season for Adam Kif's men, who came with a 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants having won the win in the three previous matches.
Dwyer opened the score in the fourth minute at 3:35 with assists by Kendall McFoll, while David Rutherford gave the assist thanks to which Boviyer doubled the lead four minutes later.
In an opening period full of action, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Markward gave the assist for the tie by Kawnie in 15:16.
Dwight secured the lead for the Giants in the first half when he scored his second goal for the evening towards the end of the first period.
The home team was regrouped and Bouchard tied again with a power demonstration goal at 27:37.
Kauni and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match towards the end of the second period and he secured victory with his team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost in four of their last five games play at their headquarters with Milton Kanes in their next match Friday.
Air traffic controller loses his life to save hundreds of plane passengers from an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is declared a hero, as he lost his life trying to secure the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing due to a major earthquake that struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to hit the area and many have been trapped in rubble in the city of Palos.
However, even though his colleagues ran to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonious Gunawan Agung refused to give up his place in the control tower that moved furiously, at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palos.
He stayed in his position to make sure that Batik Air's 6321 airline flight, located on the take-off runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he believed he was falling apart.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson, Johannes Shiret, said this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, as Australian television network ABC News broadcast.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are shocked at his death," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the dead may be thousands, while the country's disaster response agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Shigi and Butong is limited.
"The death toll is believed to increase further, as many bodies are still under ruins, while many of them we have not managed to reach," said the agency's spokesperson, Sutopo Purguo Nugroho.
Waves that reached six meters destroyed Palou, which will perform a mass burial ceremony Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Riza Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets are looted everywhere."
Jean Gelfant, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross struggles to save survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Joco Guidodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's army: "I ask you to work night and night to carry out any work related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" broadcast CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lompoc, which cost life to more than 550 people.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after plane crash in a lake
The airline flying that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports a man missing, while earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini in a press release stated that since Saturday afternoon she has been unable to find the traces of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and researchers to locate the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Boats of the area helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and the situation of all of them was stable.
The causes of the conflict and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane was docked in the lagoon outside the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane went down very low.
"That's extremely good," Janes said.
Janes said that he and others managed to advance through the water reaching them to the middle towards the emergency escape exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants had panicked and shouted and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that some sailors working nearby to improve a dock also helped rescue using an inflatable boat to carry people to shore before sinking the ship to a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in airline conflicts registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but in none of these conflicts Air Niugini was involved.
Analyst quotes the timeline of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its speech Saturday in the run-up trial of a man accused of having a woman from Mississippi burned alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
She explained to the jury how she used cell phone records to set up the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellys and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location records from various cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, disproving his previous allegations, as reported by Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified as a witness on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellys was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said "he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Cell records showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Tellys deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is due to begin its speech on Sunday.
The judge said he estimates that later that day the trial will be brought to jury judgment.

A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre, filling their music with positive messages.
High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has escaped its roots, which were political messages and tackling social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as Fugees and Common experience a recent recovery in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man? !
Nanny in New York is suing a couple who fired her after receiving a racist message.
A nanny from New York is suing a couple for racist dismissal after receiving a message that the mother accidentally sent to her where the latter complained that the nanny was "another black man."
The couple denies being racist, likening the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lindsay Plasko-Flaxman, mother of two children, was disappointed when she realized that new nanny Giselle Morris was black, once the latter appeared for her first day at work in 2016.
"OLLIII ALL OTHER BLACK" wrote Mrs. Plasko-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris and twice.
Once she realized her blunder, the awkward now Mrs. Plasko-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done no good work and waited in her place for a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for her one and only day of work and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Mrs. Morris brought an action against the couple seeking compensation for the dismissal and claims compensation of $350 a day for six-month work as an internal nanny, for which she was originally hired, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," he told the Post on Friday, while adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple refutes the claims that they are racists, saying it was reasonable to fire Morris, as they feared they could never trust her again after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," the husband Joel Plasko told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had offended, even by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Simultaneously treating the lawsuit with "extortion", Plasko said his wife had just given birth two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Would you go after someone who is in this condition?
It's not that kind," added the banking investor.
While the legal case is ongoing, the public opinion court has rushed to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not be interested in a talking teddy bear, as a new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to get into the position of someone who read it for the first time before its publication.
It's a lot of fun knowing what we now know about Paddington's huge success."
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a stuffed teddy bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweetened", as her father left life last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family," she added that her father was secretly proud of his later success.
"He was a quite quiet man and was not arrogant," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real in his eyes, it was almost like having a child who accomplishes something: you're proud of it even if it's not your achievement in fact.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nand kept calling and telling me it was very bad, that he didn't have much hope of making it," said Ms. Ednan-Laperuz.
"Sometime Nad called me to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive were slowly declining and coming out of her system.
He had already died a while ago and at that time and now it's all gone.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing this was all happening.
I couldn't scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay calm."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who so far mourns the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers who ignored the test she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I had my head down and tears were running all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I was possessed by a sense of compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women who mourn the loss of their own faces hang cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang on a Wales Bridge cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers that one can call to receive support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when she began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," he said.
The 45-year-old Mr. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a promising chef, with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile lit up the room."
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was "in a very bad state."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, was the one who found his brother after he had put an end to his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried there'll be an impact."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people out there that you can go and talk to, even if they're your friends.
Don't stay silent - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, has lost Mark, her 15-year partner, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt down or sad or something," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He'd hit bottom on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents, he wouldn't look them in the eye."
He said his death caused them a huge trauma, but they have to get over it: "It destroys the family.
It's crushing us.
But we all have to go on and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is uncertain, as the FBI is starting an investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually achieve something like what he wanted - a limited-term and limited-object survey - maybe we could bring some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, while adding that he feared that the committee would be dissolved amid entrenched party deadlocks.
Why did Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to carry out an investigation?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the timing.
The interim elections are in just five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans are not doing well, they will be significantly weakened in their attempt to achieve the election of the person they wish in the country's highest court.
George Walker Bush calls Senators, pushing them to support Mr. Cavanaugh. who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the presentation of the FBI report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Mike Pence, the vice president, to take the majority and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors falls under Kim's authority
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Yong Eun came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean unification ministry, said there were 1,127 distances last year, against 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher charges of human traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea are eventually offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers apostate illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often deports them by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, typically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the negotiations on denuclearization, which have been delayed.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Young Eun in Singapore, where they agreed in broad terms to cooperate in denuclearizing the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday North Korean Foreign Minister Rim Jong Il blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances, we will by no means disarm our country unilaterally first," Mr. Rim said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said it is out of temper unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman behaved this way, they would call her "hysterical" commented Pelosi regarding Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Affairs Committee Thursday.
Cavanaugh, with intense emotion, denied the charges that he had committed sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blazi Ford when both were teenagers.
At his opening address, Cavanaugh was deeply moved, sometimes almost shouted and his voice trembled as he talked about his family and his school years.
He also openly condemned Democrats in the committee, describing the charges against him as "a monstrous and coordinated political character assassination", organized by liberals who have been angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that she cannot serve in the Supreme Court, as she showed that he is biased against Democrats.
"I think he ruled himself out in these statements and in the way he succeeded against the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi reacted when asked whether she would try to file a complaint against Cavanaugh if his appointment was confirmed and if Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he's serving in right now," Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is a judge at the District Court of the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions on the Affordable Care Act or the Roy vs. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing discussions on confirming his appointment, Cavanaugh avoided answering questions whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Isn't it time for a hysterical, prejudiced man to go to court and wait for us to say "isn't it wonderful?" Pelosi said.
And women must have it in their possession.
It's a justified outburst, months and years of rage overflowing and can't get it out of her without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
She went on to say "she helped me a lot by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said she was crying when she was angry, but had developed a technique whereby when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
So he just kept going.
And it seemed extraordinary to me."
Tears are allowed as outburst of anger partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of a job I used to do, in an office dominated by men, is once I cried with unspeakable rage and was grabbed by the neck by an older woman - a cold principal whom I was always slightly afraid of - and pulled me to a ladder.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they broke your heart."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Senator from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught having an extramarital relationship on a ship called Monkey Business (Small Work) and left the race humiliated, Mrs Schroeder, deeply disappointed, thought there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for the presidency herself.
"It wasn't such a wise decision," he told me laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another nomination.
Someone described the situation as "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign had already begun long ago, he was back on funding and so he swore he would not enter the election race if he had not raised $2 million.
The battle was lost.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he wondered.
In her speech in which she announced that she would not start an official campaign, she was very strongly charged with feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and targeting voters instead of representatives and anger with sexism – that she felt a knot in the throat.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalls about the press's reactions to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
"He cried"?
How the trade war between the US and China can do Beijing good
The salutary volleys of the trade war between the US and China were deafening and while the battle is much longer to end, a break between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
American President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing key Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest escalation evolved this week, by imposing new tariffs on US$200 million worth of goods ($150 million), in fact by taxing half of all products imported into the US from China.
Beijing returns fire in kind each time, while recently imposed customs duties of five to ten percent on goods worth $60 million.
China is determined to return American fire and the world's second largest economy is not likely to give up soon.
In order to succeed in making Washington retreat it would have to give in to their demands, but publicly bowing to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Shi Jinping, the president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing is able to play its cards properly, American pressure in the context of the trade war could be positive for China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic collapse in either of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have admitted in the past," said Abigail Grace, a research associate centered on Asia, at the Center for New American Security (Centre for a New American Security), a think tank.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country destroyed by the seven-year (and now) war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al Mualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their everyday life and livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since 2011 when the war broke out.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al Mualem said aid to rebuild the damaged country is welcomed by the Syrian government.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe locks victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at the Le Golf National golf course, outside Paris in France.
The American team has now been defeated six consecutive times on European soil and has won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took first place again, as Danish chief Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. team star Phil Mikelston, who fought hard during the longest of the tournament, threw his shot into the water in the par-3 16th hole, granting the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all his rounds and thus became 1 of the 4 players who achieved 5–0 since the current form of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Speed was defeated at 5&4 by the lowest in the European team's player ranking, Danish Thorbjorn Olsen.
The player with the best ranking in the world, Dustin Johnson, scored 2 and 1 against Ian Pulter from England, who may have played his last game in a Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Sergio Garcia was crowned the most victorious European of all time in the tournament with total points of 25.5.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't hold on.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's all for the team and I'm glad I could help," Garcia said moved after the European victory.
He gives the baton to his fellow countryman John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual game Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up admiring this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost in all four of his matches in France and now has a career record at the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
Unusual statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and has only been surpassed by Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team had difficulty all weekend finding a target, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Fino, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
American chief Jim Farrick spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought it.
At times this morning we have pushed Europe quite hard.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the U.S. PGA and the Ryder Cup Commission and move forward.
I love those 12 kids and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us."
