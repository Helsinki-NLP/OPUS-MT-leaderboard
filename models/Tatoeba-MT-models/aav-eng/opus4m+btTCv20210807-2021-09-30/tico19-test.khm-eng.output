In addition to the outbreaks of MERS-CoV in 2012, the mortality rate was 98%, compared to 47%, and 55%, respectively.
More than 80% of people with underlying health conditions are infected with COVID-19, and MERS is less likely to be infected with COVID-19.
Assay (26%) of patients with mild symptoms (21%) are infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
As with SARS, it is very common (9%-100%) to treat cancer (29%-75%), heart disease (40%-42%), and heart disease (20-25%) and heart disease (13-25%) respectively. As a result, the mortality rate is 14%-20%.
As of 14 March, there were 2% of COVID-19 cases in China and 66576 in China.
The outbreak was confirmed that SARS had been spread between 2002 and 10% of the population.On average, 8,096 cases were reported.
In the case of MERS, it was reported that in 2012, 37% of the population were 2,494 confirmed.
As a result, the R0 strain of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 times higher than that of 95% (CI) than 5.71 to 7.23, and the R0 of SARS-CoV was less than 2 to 4 times.
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, and SARA-CoV, are less likely to be infected with R0, which is less likely to be infected with "1.1".
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2, which is similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, is a highly pathogenic virus.
