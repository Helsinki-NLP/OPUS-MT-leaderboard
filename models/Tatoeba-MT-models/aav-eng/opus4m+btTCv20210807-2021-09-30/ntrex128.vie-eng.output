The Welsh Parliament Congress (AM) is worried about 'he's like the puppets'
There is a certain concern by several parliamentary delegates regarding the change of their title to the MWP.
The issue was raised by plans to change parliament's name to the Welsh Parliament.
Congress members on the school were worried this could be a matter of conflicting public opinion.
A Labour Party representative said his party was concerned that "the word would spell with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who are not Native Wales: In Wales, twp means temporary and pwp meaning feces.
A Party Representative said the entire Party was "not proud" and proposed other names.
A Conservative Party Representative shared his party with "no prejudice" about changing its name, but did not forget to mention how MWP stands easy to turn into Muppet.
In terms of the Welsh w, it is pronounced similar to the English Yorkshire u.
The National Assembly Committee is currently drafting the bill regarding the change of name, stating: “The final decision on any identifications of the Members of Congress will, of course, be a concern for the delegates themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 empowers the Parliament of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a referendum on proposals aimed at seeking a consensus basis for the so-called Parliament of Wales.
Considering the title story of Congress delegates, the Committee is on the Wales Parliament or WMP, but the outcome of the referendum shows the trend of Parliament of Wales.
Congress members are publicly making other options, but efforts to achieve consensus may be a concern for the Chief Election Officer, Elin Jones, who is tasked with presenting a revised bill in the next few weeks.
The draft bill will include other changes to how Congress operates, including the regulation of Congress and the design of government machinery.
Members of Congress will give the final vote for what they should be renamed when they contribute to the revised bill.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing national names
The voters voted on Sunday on whether they would change their country’s name to the North Macedonia Republic.
The full vote was set up in an attempt to resolve the decades-long dispute with Greek neighbors, which also had a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor’s name corresponds to its own territory and has repeatedly opposed becoming a member of the EU and NATO of your country.
Macedonia’s President Gjorge Ivanov, a member of the opposition party who changed his national name, has announced he will cancel the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said the national change was the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Church Bell Falls Into The Squirrel When Terror Happens in Harlem
“In history, the elders I was exposed to shared that every corner of the street had a bar and a church,” Adams said.
“To this day, there is no church and there is no bar.”
He found that the disappearance of the bars was acceptable.
He said that today, “Man has many ways to advertise.”
“The bars are no longer public living rooms where people come back often.”
On the part of the churches, he was concerned that the money from selling the assets would not be as sustainable as the leaders expected "and sooner or later it would all come back at the starting line."
He added that these churches could be replaced by residential buildings with many apartments of the local peoples, which would not help in maintaining local respect.
He added: “A small part of those who buy apartments in those buildings will be white people, and then the prospect of closed churches will come faster than ever because there is no reason that the residents of those apartments will become lay people here.”
Both churches were built by white denominations before Harlem became a coloured municipality - the Metropolitan Community in the 1870s, becoming St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white catechisms moved in the 1930s.
A nearby church of worship took over the place.
St. Martin's has been taken over by a colored cult under the management of John Howard Johnson, who heads a boycott of retailers on 125 Street, a shopping center street in Harlem, who resists hiring or urges black people.
A 1939 fire caused the building to be badly damaged, but when Father Johnson’s layman planned to rebuild, they set up the bell.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell "the bell of the poor".
The bell control expert in July called it another name: “A Cultural Treasure” and “an unchanging historical treasure.”
Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first ring in the world to be played by a black musician, Dinisio A. Lind, who pursued a larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What happened at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some given by lay leaders in the church, other matters by the New Diocese.
The diocesan governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, referred to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocesan "will seek to transfer costs" to the diocesan management, although they are not involved in hiring architects and contractors that have been mentioned.
Some lay people are not satisfied with the lack of transparency on the diocesan side.
Sharks attack 13-year-old diving kid catching lobster in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while diving to California on Saturday, the first day of the shrimp catching season, authorities said.
It happened before 7 a.m., just near the Beacon's coast at Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he was driving with his friends about half an hour earlier that morning, he heard the boy shouting and then all swimming came out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought it was just an interesting scream to catch shrimp, but then he "recognised that the boy was shouting: 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
The whole of the boy’s ribs are exposed,” Hammel noticed as soon as he reached the boy’s place.
“I ask everyone to get out of the water right away: ‘There’s sharks there!” said Hammel.
The boy was moved by plane to Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he was in insurance, in critical condition.
The name of the shark is the perpetrator in an undefined attack.
Rescuers, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that they discovered a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but they determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered a severe injury in his upper body.
Officials closed the entrances to the beach from Ponto Sea in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas within 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles revealed that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's UK Beauty Market Strategy
Sainsbury's is pushing for Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with traditional display beauty booths where there are always aid professionals.
As part of the massive push into the £2.8 billion beauty market, which is continuing to grow while fashion and household goods sales decline, larger beauty booths will be tested at 11 stores nationwide and then replicated in more stores next year if there are signs.
The investment in beauty goods appears as supermarkets seek to take advantage of alternative stalls for TV counters, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it has doubled its beauty product size for the first time to 3,000 products, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Available brand chains such as L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have more space as well as other branded areas similar to the store-style display at Boots.
The supermarket is also reinforcing its Boutique makeup line so that most of the products are purely plant-based - which is increasingly hunted by young customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test a discount at two Sainsbury's stores, the first store to be opened in Croydon, south of London, while the second store opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and redirecting to buying small amounts of daily food at local convenience stores means supermarkets have to focus more attention on attracting customers.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the stalls would increasingly resemble department stores as supermarket chains try to confront offers from Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and items.
Sainsbury's, which has brought Argos' stalls into hundreds of stores and has also introduced some of Habitats' counters since they bought both brand chains two years ago, which has boosted grocery sales and helped buy back more profitable.
The supermarket has previously tried to enhance its beauty and pharmaceutical arrays but failed.
Sainsbury's tested joint ventures with Boots in the early 2000s, but cooperation ended after issues related to how to divide revenue from commodity booths in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sale of 281 of his pharmaceutical goods to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds drug chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will contribute a part of the plan, by strengthening a range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Trade Officer of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of beauty ranges to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialized training for employees who will directly offer advice.
Our series of brands are designed to fit every attractive need and environment as well as convenient locations that mean we are now an attractive stop, challenging traditional shopping.”
Peter Jones ‘indulged’ after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million contract
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, was "indulging" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11m deal in her style brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their interior brand and Truly accessories.
The couple’s business is known as Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
Lead this morning’s 37-year-old program to Instagram to announce that she will leave.
Holly Willloughby left Dragons' Den, which angered Peter Jones as she withdrew from their super-profit brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own new fat contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
In a strained meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, sources said Jones was "indulging" when the program's golden girl admitted that her new contracts -- worth up to £1.5 million -- meant that she had no time left for their interior brand and Truly accessories.
The business is known as Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is said to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby was on Instagram to announce that she would leave Truly, Jones quickly left the UK to go to one of her motels.
A source said: "To date, Truly is Holly's top priority.
That would have been her long-term future that would probably be with her in the next few decades.
Her decision to leave made the people involved very surprised.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, which was very close to the launch.
There’s a warehouse filled with goods at Marlow headquarters that’s ready to launch.”
Experts believe that the departure of the host This Morning, one of the UK’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions of dollars due to its strong investment in products from cushions and candles to clothing and interiors, and the ability to back off the launch of the product.
And that could be the end of a long-term friendship.
Willloughby's father-in-law Dan Baldwin became close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together and Jones had 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willloughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV host I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "We won't comment on his business."
They love each other deeply.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider “not to be in power” for being positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump voiced "the presenter."
“I don’t give up anything.”
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June when Trump praised it as a major step forward in denuclearization in North Korea.
But denuclearization talks have been stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s head of state Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not notice “adjusted response” from the United States to North Korea’s first arms removal moves.
Instead, he said the United States is continuing sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic look at his campaign speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
“We’re going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people may be killed.
Now we are in this good relationship.”
He said efforts to improve ties with Kim have resulted in positive results - ending missile tests, helping hostages and bringing the remains of U.S. troops back home.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to become president, but instead of having 10,000 outsiders trying to fit into this tight area, we have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia destroys the island and kills hundreds of people.
After the disaster, for example, from the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population is missing, there is no statement on the national disaster, a precondition to catalyze international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very definitive in not asking for international aid, so that’s very challenging,” Ms. Summung said.
While Save the Children is gathering a group to move to Palu, they are not sure if foreign workers can work in this area.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to consider whether international agencies are allowed to contribute aid efforts.
Despite the ongoing earthquake that Indonesia has experienced, it has not been well prepared to face the anger of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, such places were not common in other locations.
Despite the effective warning, the lack of tsunami warning whistles in Palu is likely to result in human damage.
At peak times, moving between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Disasters make logistics even more complicated.
An ambulance has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims who are looking for a way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the site of the disaster.
President Joko Widodo has transformed Indonesia’s old infrastructure into a center of his election campaign, and he has wasted money on road and rail construction.
But financial shortages have made it difficult for Joko’s administration as he faces a re-election next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from tensions between denominations that have not yet ended in Indonesia, as members of the majority of Muslims pursue a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were scuttled out of their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs slammed on the streets, using daggers, bows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Daniel Sturridge brings a draw to Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London with a goal in the 89th minute.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri in a 30-meter Chelsea frame when his team was led by 1-0.
He handled the ball with his left leg before launching a shot into the far vertical column.
Drop and head to the top right corner of the city.
The ball crosses the reach of Kepa Arrizabalaga and flies straight into the net.
“I’m simply in the right position, getting the ball and the players including Shaq always try to hit the top so I’m just trying to get up,” Sturridge said on LiverpoolFC.com.
"I see Kante coming to handle a touch and shooting without much hesitation."
Chelsea led nearly half the match after the opening of Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
In this phase, the Royal Horse forward passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic before moving around the middle of the pitch and rushing to Liverpool's pitch.
Kovacic had a turn on the wall from the middle of the yard.
He had a beautiful hoax, heading towards Hazard that was rushing to the forbidden area.
Hazard removed the defensive line and ended with his left foot in the corner of the bridge, surpassing Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
The match between Liverpool and Naples in the Champions League will take place at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3 p.m. on Tuesday in London.
The damage caused by the Indonesian tsunami reached 832.
The number of people killed in earthquakes and waves in Indonesia has increased to 832, the National Disaster Center announced early on Sunday.
A lot of people are said to have been trapped in the ruins of buildings brought up by a 7.5-degree earthquake on Friday, which followed waves up to 20 feet high, said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho of the center.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, is sinking in the ruins of buildings.

The Cromwell statue of Congress becomes the latest memorial to the story of 'rewriting history'
The exorcism would be like the covert of justice for the Taliban destruction of many serfs following him, when they destroyed countless British architectural and religious structures.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s words as “crazy” and “his attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: “It is inevitable that the debate about leaving Oliver Cromwell’s statues outside Westminster Palace will become a focus today.
The symbol of civil wars in Britain was not ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Cromwell may have been wronged by the actions of Thomas' father in the last century.
Representing Cromwell, William Hamo Thassycroft is proof of 19th-century opinion and is part of the history of a character many believe is still worthy of honor.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: Goldsmith told Sunday Telegraph: "Maybe by the end of the 19th century it will be more than now, Cromwell is seen by many as a defenseer of parliament against external pressure, in his mind, of course as monarchy.
Whether it is a perfectly accurate example of the subject in the ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the next development of our country and Cromwell was a typical figure in division.
His achievements as the Protector of the Lord are also worthy of honor and recognition.”
Pigs Kill Chinese Farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southwestern Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, known as "Yuan" was found dead with a broken artery, a whole body of blood in close proximity to a cage in the market in Cuuzhou Province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares a vaccine for pigs in an operating furnace on 30 May 2005 in Ningbo, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reportedly moving with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, the cousin discovers he has died, and sees a door of the pig cage right next to open.
He said in the cage a large male pig with a bloodmark around his mouth.
A forensic test confirmed that the 550-pound pig had attacked farmers to death.
"My brother's legs are bloody and no longer intact," the cousin was known as "Wu" according to Guiyang Evening News.
Image from the security camera showed Yuan had arrived at the market for about 4.40am to feed pigs.
After about an hour, he was found dead.
The killer pig is not a pig in the pigs of the two brothers.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market regulator are said to be negotiating compensation for his death.
Although it is not common, the case of pigs attacking people has been noted earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the husband to be seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pressed a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife threatened the animal to run away.
After a Oregon farmer suffered from a pork-fed pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are often not aggressive but blood odors can serve as "sweet."
“They just want to be close.
"They're quiet, they're curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just need to love them in the right direction,” he said.
Rosa's remnants bring heavy rain to the southwestern United States
According to the forecast, Typhoon Rosa was weakening as he headed toward a colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods across northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa has a wind strength of 85 mph, 1st Class Typhoon, as of 05:00 am Eastern Sunday, and is determined 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure began forming on the Pacific Ocean and moved eastward to the U.S. West Bank. When Rosa approached the California Baja Peninsula on Monday when it formed a tropical storm, it would begin to bring much of the North's humidity to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Afterwards, low-pressure moisture temperatures will cause large rainfall to spread in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, the amount of rain from 1 to 4 inches will cause dangerous floods, debris lines, and even the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The humidity temperature will cause rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
The rainfall is expected to reach between 2 and 4 inches in the southwest, especially on the wide side of Arizona.
Scans can occur when the situation worsens rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
The situation would be extremely challenging if the risk of walking into the desert when there was a threat from tropical rain.
Large rain can make the canyons violent rivers and storms carry local wind and dust.
Low pressure will carry a number of large local rains on the coast of Southern California.
The total amount of rain can reach more than half an inch, which is easy to cause debris lines and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains began to pour into Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain became more popular late on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will hit Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
It is possible to see some harsh temperatures across the United States in October when the Arctic is colder, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in temperatures in nearby localities.
A typical example of a significant temperature difference in the central U.S. area on Sunday.
Nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the warmth of the summer and the question will be re-created and strengthened again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. region is expected to have a warm start in October with a common temperature of about 80 in the Southern Plains to the northeast.
New York City temperatures can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees higher than average.
Long-day weather forecasts are showing high temperatures will be above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the hearing on Thursday on six television systems of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accused him of a sexual assault supposedly occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, political impasses continue, with television stations disrupting regular broadcasts with last-minute news on Friday: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to remove her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a calm move, said he was 100% certain that it didn’t happen.
It’s likely that more than 20.4 million people have been watching the hearing, according to Nielsen’s report on Friday.
The company counted average viewers on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures are not included right away for other television stations including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often encounters some problems when calculating viewers in the office.
In order to provide a correlation, the number of viewers is similar to that of a last ticket match or an Oscar.
Fox News, the host of the show’s strong support for Kavanaugh’s appointment, has led all radio stations with an average rate of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC is second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2,52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest remains huge after the hearing.
Flake is the central character in Friday’s noise.
After the Republican moderate character has made a statement that he will vote in support of Kavanaugh, he was watched by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning that he was yelled by protesters as he tried to move by elevator to the Judicial Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes when he was questioned, being broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” a woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the whole country?”
He was condemned that “you have power while too many women are powerless.”
Flake said before the elevator closed that his office had made a statement, that he would have much to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and television stations covered hours directly after that, when the Judiciary Committee would have to vote on whether Brett Kavanaugh was nominated.
But Flake said he would only do so knowing that the FBI would consider allegations against candidates next week, which some of the minority Democrats have urged.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his partner, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was heavy, as it was clear that Republicans would not have a Kavanaugh approval vote without investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May Reconcils 'political lessons' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May reiterated the criticism of the plan to leave the European Union as a "political play" to Britain's future and undermine its national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Session in Birmingham, England, 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her interview on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson emphasized his reaction to what was called their Chequers deal on Brexit, saying that Britain and the EU proposal should collect each other’s tariffs is “completely absurd.”
Police Arrested Dyteon Simpson for Death of LSU Players
Police arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting case of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player playing for LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained for second-level murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had fallen in glass during the crash.
Police found glass from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on glass, according to CBS' WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
The guarantee is set to be worth $350,000, the lawyer said.
The Baton Rouge Test Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a bullet from the head to the neck.
The Department is relying on Louisiana’s police, anti-evasion special forces, state police crime labs, Southern University police and regional residents to assist in investigation for the arrest.
LSU’s physical director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law body for its “crimination and pursuit of justice”.
Sims is only 20 years old.
Six-year-old 6-year-old forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 beats per match last season.
On Friday morning, basketball coach LSU Will Wade said the team was "sluggish" and "sluggish" before Wayde's death.
Mr Wade said, “That’s what you’re going to have to keep on.”
Volcano in Mexico City
Troer from the Popocatepetl volcano has flown to the neighborhoods of southern Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned the Mexicans on Saturday that stay away from volcanoes after the sneezing volcanic mouth and that they recorded 183 emissions and ash within 24 hours.
The center has been watching many fluctuations and shakes.
Photos on social media show thin layers of ash overshadowing the layers of windshield glass in the neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Physicists have noticed an increase in volcanic activity by 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan secessionists ahead of the anniversary of independent vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-violent police, as thousands of protesters took part in the protest on the occasion of the first anniversary of a vote on both sides of Catalonia on secession.
A group of masked secestors was held by anti-violent police with eggs and powder paints, causing black dust clouds on the streets that were often crowded with tourists.
The chaos broke out at the end of the day when police used batons to suppress the fight.
For hours, independent supporters chanted "Do not forget, do not forgive" against protesters who opposed the words, "Great Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, local media reported.
Stress remained high in the region on an independent thought one year after the October 1 referendum was considered illegal to Madrid but received by Catalan secessionors.
Independent voters overrun, although low support rates for anti-separators largely boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote at regional polling sites amid violent clashes.
The pro-independence camped on Friday night to stop a protest supporting the national police.
The protest took place before but it was forced to take place with another event.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a secession protest with his wife, said he had no hope of Catalonia's independence.
“Last year we were through the happiest moments.
I looked at my parents crying for joy when we were able to vote but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite winning important wins in the regional election in December last year, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to keep momentum this year with many of their most famous leaders or being segregated or held in custody for their role in organizing the referendum declaring independence later.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanist who returned to a protest in support of police by his phone, said the conflict was extinguished by politicians on both sides.
“The story is getting more and more stressful,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison before trial since the end of last year, announced he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“Registering as a candidate for the European election is the best way to denounce falling back in the democratic and repressive values we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: The men arrested when they put the car in their house
Three men, 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after the car was constantly incubated into a Londonderry home.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19:30 BST.
Police investigating Bob Blemmings said the incident caused damage to the gates and the building itself.
There were shots of the car at some point.
Menga's Fault brought 1-0 win for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's leading phase helps Livingston be sure to win.
Livingston was up to surprise Rangers as the home team Ibrox was led by Steven Gerrard with only two losses in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's scorer proved the difference when Gary Holt's side raised with Hibernian in just a few seconds.
Gerrard’s team has yet to have a distinct goal in this season’s Premier League and face oil leaders Hearts, who lead eight points ahead, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers welcomed Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended his series of undefeated matches in six games, when head coach Holt has tasted a failure since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses the opportunity to play against the under-the-board team
Holt's team should have been leading before they scored, with their direct tactics making Rangers difficult.
Scott Robinson struggled but overcame his goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his efforts more strongly after leading the ball to Craig Halkett on the side of the bridge.
The host team is confident to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can cause trouble for the guests with personal techniques.
And that’s the strategy for the score set.
Rangers made a penalty kick and Livingston preceded, Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated towards Menga, who had a ball touch and scored right in the middle of the bridge.
At this time, Rangers had dominated the ball but found that the defences were unable to penetrate and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no difficulty.
The match went on to the second half, although Alfredo Morelos received help from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed under his feet to Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow turned to another Livingston playplay scenario.
The continuous lead of the ball into the Livingston city frame and was repeatedly captured, with two penaltys - after Halkett's challenge for the replacement of Glenn Middleton, one because the touch of his hand on the ball - was successfully blocked.
'label' with Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A result and a final match for Livingston.
The team was excellent, continuing to reach expectations in the back of the line.
Their style of play and players have rarely changed since they returned to their top position, but significant status has been given to Holt because of how he grinded the team since he appeared.
You have too many strong players.
Captain Halkett is an overarching man who arranges a wonderfully organized line of defense, while Menga keeps Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers lacked inspiration.
As well as being under Gerrard, they did not achieve those standards.
The last shot is missing - the only chance to open the home team - and it's a wake-up scene for Rangers, the team in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received many nuances in Cologne.
There were good smiles and weather on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met with breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany to heal relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne for the opening ceremony of a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to stop crowds of 25,000 people gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters were also nearby to meet their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also condemn Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Bipolar protests reflect the separation of a guest who is praised as a hero of some Turks in Germany and is cursed by others as an autocrat.
Deptford crash: Bike rider killed in a car crash
A biker was killed in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the crossroads of Bestwood and Evelyn, a slamming neighborhood in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the medical staff arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The accident came months after another biker was killed in a car crash and fled on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday’s accident.
Police said they were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads are blocked and buses are transferred and participants are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prisoner: Six officers injured in violence
Six employees were injured in a violence in a man’s prison with strict security, the prison official said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST Sunday morning and is still taking place.
"Tornado" experts were brought to deal with the chaos, ending around 17:30.
The officers were examined at the scene with minor injuries.
A spokesman for the Prison Management Board said: "The specialized training camp staff has been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six injured employees were treated.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that the individuals involved will be transferred to the police side and may spend longer after the tremors.”
HM Long Lartin jails more than 500 prisoners, including the nation's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the Prison Supervisor was treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-violent officers were called to prison to deal with a serious rebellion in which employees were attacked with balls.
Typhoon Rosa Déves Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with the Passing Floods (Lost Zones Can Be Benefited)
It’s rare that tropical depression strikes Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when Typhoon Rosa’s energy seals on the southwest desert remain, carrying flood risks.
The National Meteorological Service released flood tracking on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to the south and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake.
Typhoon Rosa is expected to follow a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, but on Monday night there was rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix mentioned in a statement that only "tens of tropical tornadoes have formed tropical storms or tropical depressions within 200 miles of substituting Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) is a storm within 40 miles of landing on the Arizona border.”
The latest forecasting models from the latest National Hurricane Center predicted about 2 to 4 inches high rainfall, with a level of flooding separated by up to 6 inches at the Mogollon Belt in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert include the central Rockies Centre and the Great Boundaries are likely to flood between 1 and 2 inches, with a level of separate flooding that can reach up to 4 inches.
With areas that don’t flood suddenly, the rain from Hurricane Rosa can be a good sign because the region is droughting.
Although flooding is a deep concern, some waterfalls may be happy to welcome because the Southeast is suffering from drought.
According to weather.com, the U.S. drought monitoring agency said just over 40 percent of Arizona region is suffering from the lowest-level extreme drought, but remains the second-highest in the same category.
First, Typhoon Rosa Street left the landslides across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still in storm range at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, from southern Punta Eugenia, Mexico 385 miles, and moves north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm hit colder oceans in the Pacific Ocean and then weakened.
As a result, it is expected that there will be landslides in Mexico when tropical depression passes on Monday evening.
Rainfalls in areas in Mexico may be significant, signaling the possibility of floods not small.
According to Weather.com, “The total rainfall is estimated at 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora, which can be up to 10 inches.”
Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday as a tropical depression, then scan through Arizona and land in southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main risk forecasting from Rosa or its remnants is huge rainfall in Baja California, Northwest Sonora and the southwest United States desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause floods and life-threatening floods in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Suspects Suspectly Killed
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of intentional murder after a 16-year-old was found to have been stabbed in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace region at Midsomer Norton around 4pm BST on Saturday morning.
You were taken to the hospital in "stabilized" condition.
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in Radstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officers have called on everyone to keep any footage related to the incident, come to the press release.
Trump says Kavanaugh “has the selfishness, anger” of Democrats
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the brutal and excessive tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr Trump said Mr Kavanaugh "has the selfishness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his election.
Kavanaugh countered Congress on Thursday, denying a strong and fierce allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades before they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing of her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans have seen Kavanaugh's excellence and dignity and courage that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to assert that one of the most prominent legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a resume of true public service,” he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president mentioned the details of Brett Kavanaugh's election when it comes to the importance of voting for Republicans in the midterm election.
There are only five weeks left to one of the most important elections in my life.
I'm not running but running." he shared.
"That's why I'm going everywhere to fight for bright candidates."
Trump said Democrats were trying to "restrict and hinder."
The first core procedure vote on the Senate floor for Kavanaugh’s election is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed by earthquakes, tsunamis in Indonesia, and damage increased.
At least 384 people have been killed, many have been swept away as huge waves hit the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami landed on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered during a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as waves reached six meters (18 feet) above the shore at sunset, sweeping people to death and wreaking everything on its way.
The waves followed a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people are still taking part in their activities on the beach and don’t leave immediately and they become victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Prevention Agency (BNPB).
“The tsunami doesn’t come on its own, it drags with cars, woods, houses, scans through everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed through open waters at 800 kph (497 mph) before landing on the coast.
Some climb the tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photos taken by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops were destroyed, broken bridges and collapsed and a mosque was sunk in water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes have been found in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Applications Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that according to the energy source launched by a strong earthquake on Friday was about 200 times as high as that of the atomic bomb that crashed into Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have strengthened the size of the tsunami, according to the statement.
Nugroho described the damage as "great" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage may not stop along the 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The media "completely paralysed with no news" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its employees and volunteers are coming to affected areas.
“This was a tragedy, but the tragedy could become much more horror,” they said.
The agency was widely condemned on Saturday for failing to announce that tsunamis hit Palu, although officials said the waves had come over time.
In an unspecialised video posted on social media, it was possible to hear a man standing on high shouting panic to those on the road about the approaching tsunami.
A few minutes later, a wall of water spilled into the shore, scanning the buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn’t confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused large power outages that disrupted regional contact around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military had begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuations still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will close until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian Wave increased by more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala have safely arrived in the city of Palu, where employees are in tarpaulins built in office yards, they have gone through devastating scenes on the road, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is bad.
Even if aid groups began significant moves at the start of disaster relief tools, some people complained that foreign aid workers with high expertise were prevented from moving to Palu.
According to Indonesia’s regulations, funding, foreign supplies and personnel can only begin if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened.
"This remains a provincial disaster," Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said.
“Once the government decides, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can be ready for international support but there is no statement.’
As the second night falls on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those who are still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be a miracle to pair the dark stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled up from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers freed a woman trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia’s national parachute coach, has trained two of the missing parachute players for the Asian Games, held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others were trapped at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, his students.
"As a veteran in the field of parachuting, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon said that within hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread in the parachute community, he desperately texted WhatsApp to rivals in Palu, who were attending the beach festival.
However, his message indicated there was a gray volume instead of two greens.
“I think that means that the messages were not sent,” he said.
The robbers took away $26,750 when the ATM was deposited at Newport in Levee.
According to reports from the Newport Police Department, the robbers took away $26,750 from a Brink banker while they were depositing into an ATM in Newport in Levee.
The driver in the car cleared the ATM in the entertainment district and prepared to hand over more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy reported in the article.
When he was busy, a man "was coming from behind the Brink employee" and taking away the money bag had to be delivered.
According to the report, witnesses saw several suspects slammed around the scene, but police were not able to identify the number of subjects involved in the case.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the suspected involvement please contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper renamed Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He wrote in a statement about the change on Twitter on Saturday: “People knew me before that I was Kanye West.”
West, 41, named Ye for some time and used the name as the eighth album released in June.
The change came before he appeared on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album Yadhi.
He was a guest to the show in place of singer Ariana Grande when she said she was "emotional disorder," the program's creator said.
As in his current name, West had previously said the word was religious to him.
"I believe that "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and in the Bible it means "you," West said earlier this year, while talking about his album title with Big Boy.
“I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
The transition goes from Kanye, which means the only, to Ye - the reflection of good, the bad, the bad, everything.
The album is more than our own reflection.
He was one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is widely known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he was aiming for Love and Brother Love.
An artist who has partnered with West, JAY-Z, is also wondering whether there is or no dashes and flowers.
Mexico’s president says he will not bring troops against civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "never put the military down on the Mexican people."
The military opened fire during a protest for peace in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at the time as leftist student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn in to support Mexican youth by providing monthly grants to learners and opening up free public universities.
He shared that the issue of unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to stick to the evils.
The United States should double A.I. aid.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in the field, investors and practices on AI Kai-Fu Lee, who once worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even while the entire U.S. is lacking official AI strategies.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plans last year: its goal to become a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“The double the budget for AI research will be a positive start, as all other countries fall behind the United States very far, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Double the funding could double the chance that the next giant AI achievement would be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book "Super Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked at an AI system that beats the top U.S. Othello players, then as chief executive at Microsoft Research and director of the Google branch in China.
Lee approached previous U.S. government tech competitions such as the Advanced Project Research Agency’s Robot Challenge and was concerned when the next competition would take place, to help determine the next vision.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government aid, Lee said.
“It’s not that China is calling for all scholars to be at the forefront; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired bright stars from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee shares changes in immigration policy that can also help the United States strengthen its AI efforts.
He added: “I think green cards should be automatically granted to doctors about AI.”
China’s parliament issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee added: China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides aid to those of academic institutions similar to how the Foundation and other government institutions fund U.S. researchers, but the quality of research in China is lower.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Department of Defense established a Center for Artificial Intelligence, which would intervene with partners from industry and education, and the White House announced the establishment of the Artificial Intelligence Selection Committee.
This month the Advanced Defense Research Projects Command announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
At the National Science Foundation, they now invest more than $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law has sought to establish a National Security Council on Artificial Intelligence but has not seen any move for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on national change
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to the North Macedonia Republic, which is a decades-long dispute resolution with Greece that would prevent European Union and NATO from joining.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, asserts that its northern neighbor's name corresponds to its own territory and has vetoed NATO and EU participation.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but those who opposed nationalism suggested that the change would undermine the national identity of the majority of the Slavic people in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about whether voters would meet at least 50% of the request for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum reads: “Do you agree to become a member of NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece.”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said it was a price paid to pursue entry into institutions such as the EU and the NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, at Skopje, said: “Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can freely enjoy the patronage of the European Union because that’s towards a safer life for all of us.”
Although members of parliament are not legally bound, they have said they will comply with the vote results to make decisions.
The name change will require two-thirds of the vote in Congress.
The National Election Commission said there were no reports of anomalies until 1pm.
However, the voter rate was only 16%, compared with 34 percent in last year’s parliamentary election when 66 percent of voters registered for the vote.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, in the capital Skopje, said: “I went to vote for my children, because our position was in Europe.”
The prime minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia on the change of their national name, which would pave the way for NATO and the European Union to join in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
Before parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is preparing a small podium and pulling the seat in front of the tent that is erected by those who will boycott the referendum.
Kavadarkov said: "We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join the main road, not through the back door."
“We are a poor nation, but we are poor.
If they don’t consider us Macedonia, then we can move to other countries such as China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian bond.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that as a NATO member will bring very urgent investments to Macedonia, where unemployment accounts for more than 20 percent.
“I believe that most will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He shared that a “disagreement” result would be “the assertion of our future.”
A poll released Monday by the Macedonia Institute for Policy Research said about 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required vote.
Another poll, conducted by the Telma TV of Macedonia, said 57 percent of respondents had plans to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they gave the vote.
A successful referendum must have a vote of 50 percent and one vote.
The failure in the referendum showed the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since last May.
Watch: Sergio Aguero at Manchester City has crossed the entire Brighton defensive line for scoring goals.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke out of Brighton's defense with Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero performed in class with a score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received the pass from the middle of the pitch when he began to lead the ball.
He slammed up before three Brighton defenders before slamming up into the empty courtyard.
Then Aguero finds himself surrounded by four blue shirt players.

The pass to the left, leading the ball to Sterling.
The Englishman took his first ball in the forbidden round for Aguero, who slammed his right shoes with a shot to defeat Brighton Mathew Ryan from the right side of the net.
Pep Guardiola told reporters: "Aguero has some injuries in his legs."
“We talked about just letting him play for about 55 or 60 minutes.
What happened.
We were lucky he scored at that time.”
But it is Sterling who gives the first advantage to the blue-green players in the match at the Premier League.”
He scored in the 29th minute.

Scherzer wants to burn himself back to Rockies.
With the Nationals team being removed from the final round of tickets, there are no many reasons to start again.
But a wary Scherzer hopes to win the game on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but this only makes sense when there is a competition for Rockies, the team that leads a game against Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies won at least one special feature with a 5-2 win over Nationals on Friday night, but was still trying to hold the top spot.
"Although playing is meaningless, at least we are thrown when we know about the atmosphere in Denver along with the crowd and other teams that will play with any of the highest levels I can stand for this year.
Why don't I want to play in such a game?
The Nationals team has yet to announce their debut in Sunday's match, but it seems Scherzer will be playing in this situation.
Scherzer, who launched his 34th start, will have a ball training session on Thursday and compete on his Sunday vacation.
The right arm of the Washington team scored 18-7 with 2.53 ERA (average value) and 300 attacks in 220 two-thirds of this season.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The president mentioned the details of the situation around his Supreme Court, choosing Brett Kavanaugh when it comes to the importance of voting for Republicans in the midterm election.
“All we do is have the potential in November.
There are only five weeks left to one of the most important elections in my life.
This is one of the big, big things - not running but running is the reason why I’m going everywhere to fight for bright candidates.”
Trump continued: “You’ll see the negative, negative Democratic Party existing right now.
And they are determined to suppress their authority by using any means, and then you will see selfishness and tricks.
They don’t care who hurts, they have to step on who to gain power and control, they just want to get power and control, and we won’t give them that.”
He added, "The Democrats are trying to 'restrict and hinder'."
"You've seen it in the last four days." He added that Democrats are "indeed and selfish and tricks and lies."
He pointed out that the Senate Judiciary Committee has identified Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which has swayed from below.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you reveal information?
Yeah.
No, no, no, I'm expecting -- it's an excellent body language -- it's the worst type of body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer an open party.
Making an opinion is unacceptable.
I was not surprised that Momentum activists, in my local party, voted to censor me.
After all, I was the latest in a series of Labour MPs who were told that I was not welcome - for raising opinions.
As a member of Congress with me, Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she firmly supported oppositionism.
In my case, the censorship move aimed at me because of disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a national economic policy, in terms of national security, in Europe, similar issues were irony that Jeremy disagreed with earlier leaders.
Informing the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that “we want meetings to be inclusive and effective.”
For nearly eight years as a MP for the local Labour Party, Friday night’s leadership meetings were all going like that.
Sadly, today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the political promise of "more delicate, more gentle" has been forgotten for a long time and really whether it has ever begun."
It is increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that all opinions are evaluated as to whether or not the party’s leaders accept them.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as my former colleagues thought that my political co-smopolitan had begun to expect me to transform my mind and take on positions that I would never approve of - whether national security or EU market indications.
Whenever I speak publicly - and indeed whatever I say - pulls the abuse on social media calling for removal, condemns central politics, telling me that I should not join the Labour Party.
And not only do I see that.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because of my comments on me that have a political trend.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face the flow of sexual abuse or racial discrimination every day but never avoid it.
One of the saddest aspects of this political age is the level of abuse that has become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour Party should cherish the culture of tolerance.
The fact that we are no longer that Open Party, and with every "untrustful" move or change of the rule of choice, the Party has become narrowed.
I’ve had a lot of advice over the last two years about urging me to stay calm, not too much words and then I’ll be “shocked.”
But I'm in politics not that way.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a boy, I was driven by the neglect of Thatcher's government, which caused my comprehensive school to collapse literally, I tried to bring better public services to those who needed them most - whether it was local commissioner or government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be misinterpreted about my policies and disagreements with the current leader.
For those who have pushed the move on Friday, all I want to share is that when the country is in Brexit, it will hurt our households, businesses and public services, I don’t want to waste my time and energy on loyalty to the Labour Party leadership.
But indeed, a message outside Nottingham Momentum that I am looking for, to send to my voters, whether it is a Labour Party member or not: I am proud to serve and I promise there will be no threat to remove or any political means that prevents me from acting for what I believe is the greatest benefit to my grandmother.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Ayr Undefeated Lead
Two attempts may have misaligned the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win the final Tenent Premiership tournament of the day.
Now they stand at the top of the board, the only crown in ten teams.
In other words, it’s their superior defence, as well as more opportunities for them, bearing the title of host team and coach Peter Murchie completely has the right to be satisfied.
“So far, we have walked through our games so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I’m happy.”
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said: “Give Ayr, they capture better opportunities than we do.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute score, scored by Frazier Climo, took Ayr ahead, but, a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, opened the game for Warriors, allowing Melrose to show his skills and Jason Baggot to set a ball to the ball.
Climo rose to lead Ayr with a penalty, before which, in the first half, he scored another score with a solo phase raising the score to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose began the second half in a favorable way, and Patrick Anderson went public, Baggot scored more points, shortening the score to five points.
After a long period of serious injuries to Ruaridh Knott, who fell down, and since restarting, Ayr has led to a superior lead by Stafford McDowall’s publicity, Climo scored further.
Captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson, was then carded gold, and once again Melrose caused the player to lower the price with a non-scoring score by Bruce Colvine, before a strained pressure.
However, the host team was back, and when Struan Hutchinson was carded gold for confronting Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson scored on the support advantage of the Ayr team.
Climo scored more points, as he had done almost since his return, after Kyle Rowe received David Armstrong's ball and passed to winger Gregor Henry after the host's fifth score.

The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon were further painted: "The sea is our right.
“The ocean is our mission.”
Every corner of Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile during the bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive - as well as the desire to sail to the Pacific again.
Those hopes were perhaps the most burning for decades, as Bolivia was waiting for the international justice court ruling on October 1 after five years of consideration.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, said: “Bolivia has the motivation, the spirit of unity and calmness, and of course is expected in a positive view of results.”
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ's ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the courts in The Hague will support Bolivia's claim, that after decades of intense exchanges - Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign way out of the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s convincing original president, who faces a fierce debate to re-election next year - also has many cards in Monday’s ruling.
At the end of August, he insisted: “We are about to return to the Pacific Sea.”
But some analysts argue that the court is not likely to decide to support Bolivia - and this is less likely to change.
The U.N. with its Dutch headquarters has no right to give Chilen territory and has provided that they will not determine the outcome of potential exchanges.
The ICJ’s ruling came just six months after the final debate was made that the situation was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
And beyond Bolivia’s lawsuit, the last four years could be turned back.
Zárate said: "The problem of access to the sea was attacked by the current Bolivian government."
She added that Morales’ aggressive statements have turned off all of Chile’s remaining goodwill.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate with each other, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative to The Hague, rejected the idea that court decision making was unusually rapid.
Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new era with relations with Chile” and an opportunity to end 139 years of mutual dissidents,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most famous presidents in Latin America - was using the issue of navigation as a political lifeboat.
Bolivia added: "Bolivia will never abandon access to the Pacific."
“The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to walk past the past.”
North Korea says there will never be nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has revealed that his country will never disarm its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to make promises during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two sides.
He made comments as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be preparing to restart its nuclear foreign policy more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was "a dream" to continue U.S. sanctions and opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War to make North Korea subdued.
Washington is cautiously agreeing with the statement without Pyongyang taking notice of the first disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is no doubt that Pyongyang is serious about giving up a arsenal of weapons that the country can see as the only way to ensure safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion launches the latest line of hot hats that are about to cover across the big streets near you
If you want to loosen the hat collection or completely stay away from the sun then you don’t have to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of other large-sized team designs in their SS19 collection on the runway that would surprise the design style at the Paris Fashion Week.
The high-applying hats scanned Instagram this summer and the designers brought their eye-catching creations on the show.
Valentino's prominent item is a beige over-the-circle cap attached to feather-like accessories, covered on the model's head.
Other oversized accessories include wrench, witch hats and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thomson Browne also revealed a series of strange masks - just as well as keeping up for Halloween.
Many colorful masks are sewn in a similar style to Hannibal Lecter than high-end fashion.
A complete diving device-like design with a breathing tube and a protective glass, while another device looks like a melted cider cream.
And if you continue to catch up in a huge fashion direction - then you're lucky.
The mermaids predict that large earbuds may be about to cover across big streets near you.
The large hats became hot on the heels of ‘La Bomba’, the a few rim wide hats used by Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand of charm behind the extremely impractical hat launched across the social media has brought another major creation to the show - a bag of beach trips that is close to the bath suit.
The fire-colored raffia fiber bag, bordered with the raffia fiber with the upper part with a white handle, is a prominent item in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beachbags overflowing over big streets next summer because the designer has made such a huge impact that it’s hard to ignore the need for big accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland maintain their excellent academic style, which continued in 2018 with a series of praiseworthy learning outcomes, reinforced by both individuals and groups on sports, arts, music and community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, sponsored by the Scottish Council for the Advancement (SCIS), are working to bring the best quality of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to equip deep and wide knowledge, as well as to guide your students’ careers and positions as global citizens.
As an educational division that can design and run the school’s specific curriculum, we see modern foreign languages continue to be a popular and selected topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in his language, what he says will go into his reason.
If you talk to him in his own language, the things that come out will come into his affection.”
This is a compelling message that we don’t just rely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From recent exams this year, we can see that foreign languages are leading in rankings with the best in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language students score higher than A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved more than A in Chinese, while 72 percent studied German, 69 percent studied French and 63 percent learned Spanish also achieved A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are going to see foreign languages as essential skills that children and adolescents will not be able to have in the future.
The elective language subjects are being considered as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private school programs as well as elsewhere.
A 2014 survey conducted by the UK Council of Skills and Careers found that in the reasons employers have difficulty finding people, it is due to a lack of foreign language skills.
As a result, foreign language skills become more practical in order to equip young people into future career practices.
With more career prospects needed to have a foreign language, these skills became practical in an increasingly flat world.
No matter how people choose to work, if they learn a second language, they will get a real advantage in the future when there is such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly in the native language, a polylinguist will obviously lead every challenge.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to practice a simple assembly in another foreign language, and only French was the only foreign language with a unit number, 15 percent.
That’s why investing in language teaching is essential for today’s children.
Taking in multi-lingual hands, especially the languages of developing economies, will equip children with brighter potential in finding a real job.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
Some schools will focus on more modern foreign languages, while others will teach foreign languages that are considered important to the UK in view of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
No matter what your child likes, there are a variety of foreign languages to choose from within private schools, along with a team of teachers who have expertise in the profession.
Private schools in Scotland focus on providing an academic environment that prepares and equips children with essential skills for success, no matter what the future is hiding.
It is impossible to deny that, in an international business environment, foreign languages will continue to be an extremely important factor in the future of the nation, which should be replicated in education.
In fact, modern foreign languages should be evaluated as "international communication skills."
Private schools will continue to give this opportunity to young Scotlanders: diverse and export them.
There can be no other choice.

LeBron at the start of the battle at Lakers in the last Sunday match at San Diego.
The wait is about to come to an end for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James play the first game for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in a pre-season match against Denver Nuggets on Sunday at San Diego.
But how long you'll be in the game has not been identified.
Walton said on Lakers’ official website: “It’s going to be less than 48 minutes.”
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said James is likely to be in the game for limited time.
Watching the trainings of the week, James is asked about his schedule for six pre-season matches at Lakers.
He said: “I don’t need to play some games before this season in my career.”
Trump's campaign in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
Tonight, in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump starts his campaign.
This is the first stop in the five presidential campaigns by Trump next week, including a stop in pro-state states such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
The vote for the candidate nominated for the empty seat of the Supreme Court is being delayed, Trump is trying to contest his support ahead of the upcoming midterm election, where Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress as the vote begins in November.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia starts tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's campaign in Wheeling City, West Virginia is expected to begin at 7 p.m. in eastern hours, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Mr. Trump's campaign in West Virginia live on YouTube.
President Trump may be referring to Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing this week, a Supreme Court judge who is now facing allegations of sexual assault, and Senate approval vote has to be moved a week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
However, the main purpose of the campaign was to craft support for Republican candidates ahead of the November election.
Therefore, according to Reuters, the campaign’s goal through five next week’s campaign aims to “help Republican volunteers and supporters in the race to protect and expand the majority of the votes they hold in the Senate and House.”
“The control of Congress is an important issue in the agenda, so the president will visit as many states as possible before entering the busy election season,” a campaign spokesman told Reuters.
It is expected to take place in Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling City, this night’s campaign could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, while attracting Pittsburgh media to the news,” West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday will be President Trump’s second visit last month to West Virginia, which he won 40 percent away in 2016.
Trump is trying to support Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia State Senator, as he is currently behind in the polls.
Simon Haeder, a political science researcher at the University of West Virginia, said: “The president’s visit to the state is not a good sign to Morrisey.”
2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team is determined to fight the trophy in single matches on Sunday
After three unweighted matches, the double match on Saturday afternoon could be essential for the Ryder Cup.
The shake-style wrist swing to create momentum is an entirely new sporting concept, but also the impact that athletes really trust, especially in games like this.
Where is the current momentum?
“They’ve been ahead of six points, flying now is just four, and I think it’s the driving force for us,” said Jordan Spieth as he walked for a relaxing walk.
Of course, the European team has an advantage, leading four points ahead, and they have 12 games left.
As Spieth says, the American team still has some hope and they are greatly encouraged, especially with the selection of Spieth and Justin Thomas. The two players have played several times and each has spent three points.
Spieth was the veteran golfer in playing the ball from the ball position to the golf hole and he always led the mirror.
The shouts of joy are getting bigger when it comes to his rounds, especially the ball to draw the match as he and Thomas hit the golf hole in turn.
The 15th match was the same, which means he was fully confident in the American team’s backflow.
Spieth said, “You have to think carefully and worry about your own game.”
All the athletes left.
There are 18 holes left to score.
In the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an indisputable legend of the Ryder Cup, were the only couple to win points higher than Spieth and Thomas.
This strange but remarkable couple of the European team won 4:0 and could not make a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the following nine holes on Friday morning.
That victory and the energy from them spread to the crowded crowd of supporters gives people the feeling that the two of them are the opponents to defeat on Sunday; and no player deserves more than Fleetwood or Molinari to defend the European team’s victory at the sundown on Le Golf National.
I hope that both of you will also appear in different golf holes.
However, it is too early to confirm the European team's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourball series in the morning, when playing with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes made the Spanish and Swedish golfer completely lost the chance to counter-attack.
On Sunday, no one could pull them out of that failure.
The fourball and foursome matches are always worth the most because of the interaction between the duos, their advice, and the observation of the strategy of playing changes only in the score.
The European team played better teams and led quite far ahead of the final day of the match, but this foursome series showed that the US team had a chance to win.
European team lead 10-6 ahead of the start of the final game Ryder Cup
The European team will take advantage of the last Ryder Cup day after the spectacular fourball and foursome games, leading to the U.S. 10-6 team.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari take the lead with two Tiger Woods wins to win four points on Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn on the European side, determined to win the trophy back to lose on your team in Hazeltine two years ago, won the U.S. side in the morning fourball match, leading 3-1.
The U.S. team played better in the foursome series, winning two games, but could not win the final.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in the singles series on Sunday to win the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European player to win four consecutive points when he and Molinari, commonly referred to as the "Molliwood" couple as the second pair after the dramatic weekend of the game, won four points in four openings in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourball match, they had a more convincing victory over Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a score of 5&4.
Woods played two games on Saturday and sometimes there were bright moments, but so far he has lost 19/29 games in the fourball and foursome series, including seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, after resting in the morning fourball series, returned to Henrik Stenson in a foursome match, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, two players ranked 1 and 3 in the world, with a score of 2&1.
However, despite the pleasant southwestern weather of Paris, the European team did not have an easy day.
The player who won three times Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set an important milestone for the U.S. team with two points on Saturday.
They won 2&1 convincingly against Spanish golfer Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball match, and then continued to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a score of 4&3 in the foursome match, despite missing the first two losses.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only twice a team led by four points can start single matches, though the Furyk team only needs to hold the cup.
After being considered the second-placer in two days, Sunday will most likely become a back-end for the team.
North Korea declares 'no-one' unilateral disarmament in lack of trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that sanctions are still being maintained deepening their suspicions against the United States and in this situation it will never unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said during the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, North Korea has taken "many goodwill measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test bases and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see the same move from the US,” he said.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t be confident of national security, and in such a situation, we’ll never be unilaterally disarmed.”
While Ri repeats a familiar North Korean complaint about Washington’s refusal to disarm nuclear weapons “in stages” and North Korea will receive corresponding benefits when taken step by step, his speech has a remarkable point of not denying the unilateral disarmament of nuclear weapons as Pyongyang has declined before.
Ri mentioned a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12.
North Korea is still trying to find a way to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. has insisted that North Korea abandons its nuclear weapons first.
Washington is also opposed to calls for loosening international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on 'rescuing nuclear weapons first' and increasing pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive way, even opposed to 'the declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The point is that sanctions can make us kneel down just as the wild dreams of those who don’t understand us.
But the problem here is that these remaining sanctions continue to lose our trust.”
Ri did not mention plans to hold a second summit between Chairman Kim and President Trump as the U.S. leader presented to the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the foreign minister referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the parties negotiate the issue of nuclear disarmament, not the United States, the denuclearization talks will not fall into a stalemate."
However, Ri's tone was different from last year, when he told the General Assembly that North Korea's launch of missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable on a suicide mission after Trump called Kim "The Missile".
Last year at the United Nations, Trump threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but Trump also stressed that there is a lot to do and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set a deadline for this: “Two years, three years or just five months is not a problem.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for their efforts.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday told the United Nations Security Council: "The Security Council sanctions must continue to be carried out strongly and uncompromisingly until we can confirm the results of denuclearization completely, ultimately, with proof of verification."
The Security Council has agreed to strengthen sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo spoke on the sidelines of U.N. General Assembly official meetings and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the final result was not very good.
He left Pyongyang after his July visit and said the talks had made certain progress, but just hours later, North Korea accused the foreign minister of making "black society-like demands."
North Korea is committed to a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-In this month to dismantle a missile test base and a nuclear complex if the United States has "a similar attitude."
He said Chairman Kim directed that "the same attitude" he was looking for was the security assurance Trump had committed during the Singapore talks and progressed toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take full rest course
In an effort to combat machine pressure learning culture, with ‘night’ students drinking coffee change water, a new course at Harvard this year has encouraged all college students to sleep more.
Students who study at this world’s number one university often don’t know the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical University, is also an expert at the Women’s Hospital and Brigham who designed the course and he himself believes it is the first course of this category in the United States.
The inspiration began this course after he took part in a conversation about the impact of lack of sleep on the learning process.
“After the end of the conversation, a female student came to me and said, ‘Why did you know this until the end of the year?’
She said that no one told her about the importance of sleep, which really surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course is first introduced this year, explaining how important good sleep habits help improve your learning and sports outcomes, and improving your overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard University of Medicine and the university’s executive health services, said the school decided to introduce the course after finding students with severe sleep shortages during the week.
The one-hour course includes a wide range of interactive tasks.
In part there is a dormitory room image in which students can click on coffee cups, curtains, workouts and books to learn about how the effects of caffeine, light and lack of sleep affect sports performance, as well as the importance of forming sleep habits on time.
In another section, participants were asked how long-term sleep shortages could increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, university campus maps, with interactive symbols, encourage participants to think about their daily habits.
“We know that this course cannot immediately change student behavior.
But we believe that they have the right to be known - just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing smoking," Czeisler added.
He said that the culture of pride of the "night shot" still exists, while modern technologies and increasing pressure on students lead to sleep shortages is an increasingly serious problem.
Ensuring enough sleep, good sleep quality should become a student’s ‘secret weapon’ to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to fall into a state of hunger, leading to our constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who is studying biology, chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, while also taking one of last year’s classes in Harvard’s first year.
He said the course helped him “open his eyes” and inspired him to make an effort to organize a course throughout the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to suggest that all graduate students take a similar degree program before starting to compete in the main course.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students take into consideration when setting an alarm hours to bed, waking hours, and be aware of the harm of the ‘green light’ that comes from the electronic display and LED lights, which can cause your biological rhythm disorder, leading to difficulty sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga defeats Gerrard's boys
Rangers had an unsuccessful day when Dolly Menga's counterattack made Steven Gerrard's team lose 1-0 to Livingston.
The Ibrox team hopes to mark the first win since the 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team has caused the second Gerrard defeat in 18 games as head coach, which stretches eight points from the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts team.
Menga maintained the attack seven minutes before the end of the first half, but Rangers' gas seemed to have never been crushed.
Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, while Livingston has climbed to third place, and only after Hibernian in terms of goal difference.
The Rangers also had to deal with another problem after Calum Spence had to treat the wound at his head after a clear object was thrown from the head of the guest yard.
Gerrard changed the squad eight times compared to the squad that had surpassed Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-final.
On the other hand, Holt kept the Livi 11 and won a point ahead of the Hearts team last week and he must have been very excited about how his students surrounded his opponents in each attack.
Although Rangers hold more of the ball, Livingston is a really dangerous team when there is a ball.
They should have scored just two minutes after Menga first launched Scott Pittman on the pitch, attacking Allan McGregor’s frame but the midfield missed the opportunity.
A deep shot by Keaghan Jacobs takes the ball to the foot of Captain Craig Halkett, but defender Alan Lithgow can only bring the ball to the back of the frame.
Rangers take control of the ball on the pitch, but their gameplay is mostly based on hope more than faith, especially in the last one-third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos was certain that he had to receive a penalty on the penalty because he and Steven Lawless had been hit but referee Steven Thomson denied the Colombian player's appeal.
Rangers had only twice hit the frame in the first half, but former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly had hardly had trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's first blow and Ovie Ejaria's counterattack.
Although Livi's opening of the score at the 34th minute was thought to be an advantage, no one could deny that their victory was absolutely worth it.
Once again, Rangers couldn’t handle Jacobs’ deep margin throw.
Scott Arfield was unable to react when Declan Gallagher poked Scott Robinson, while Scott calmly chose Menga to make a simple finish.
Gerrard immediately had the option during his break, by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and replacing him with almost immediate impact when the winger teased Morelos but Kelly made an impression when immediately blocking the ball.
But Livingston succeeded in attracting guests to play in the right way they wanted, when Lithgow and Halkett repeatedly launched long passes.
Holt's team had the opportunity to rise ahead in the last minutes of the match, but unfortunately McGregor chose the right position to stop Jacobs before Lithgow hit wide from the corner.
The new player to Rangers' Glenn Middleton continued to claim a penalty after a collision with Jacobs, but was again rejected by Thomson.
Director: Inventor of Geiger Count
Citing a page from the Director of Sunday morning: On September 30, 1982, 136 years ago, and TOY ... future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a radiological detection and measurement method, which invented the platform for the device called Geiger Count.
Since then, the Geiger Counter has not only become a scientific pillar, but also a pillar of popular culture. The following example is a conversation in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", which was screened by the scientist and cowboy king Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, “What is this?”
Rogers: "This is Geiger Counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of radioactive atoms in minerals.”
Evans: "Yes, there's a sound here!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63th birthday.
However, the invention of his name remains with time.
New cancer application can teach the immune system how to 'see' damaged cells
New cancer application can teach the immune system how to 'see' damaged cells and destroy them
To teach the immune system how to recognize damaged cells during treatment
This method includes taking immune cells from patients, cell changes in the laboratory.
Then these cells can 'see' the protein that is common in many cancers and are injected back into the body.
A test vaccine is showing positive results in patients with different cancers.
A woman is treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells and her ovarian cancer cells disappear after more than 18 months.
This method includes taking immune cells from patients, changing cells in the laboratory, so that these cells can "see" the protein that is common in many cancers, called HER2, which is then injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute of the United States, Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our research results show that we are in the hands of a promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promots the development of certain types of cancer", including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and rectal colons, Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of study, taking immune cells from the patient’s body and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells, has worked during the treatment of a type of leukocyte.
Kanye gets many "swimming" out of support for Mr. Trump, the MAGA Hat (Make America Great Again) after Saturday's Live Night (SNL)
It's not going well.
Kanye West received a lot of shouts in the studio during the SNL Night, after his manicure performance. During the performance, he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and insisted he was going to run for the election in 2020.
After performing the third song, Ghost Town, still wearing the Hat Make America Great Again, he expressed anger against Democrats and asserted support for Trump.
"A lot of times I talked to white friends, they said, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
If I were worried about racism, I would have left the United States for a long time," he said.
SNL started the show with a minor featuring Matt Damon. In the minor, the Hollywood star ironed Brett Kavanaugh's oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the show was not aired, the footage recorded West’s angry speech was named Chris Rock on social media.
It’s not clear whether Rock deliberately mocked West when writing this post.
In addition, West also complained to the audience that he was uncomfortable in the back of his chicken wings just because of his hat.
“They bullied me while behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t show up with that hat.”
They bullied me!
Then they said I was swamped,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner magazine.
West went on: "Do you know what it's swamping?", he said, "to ride my hero's iconic hat, because no one can force me to do anything. If you want the world to move forward?
“Love me.”
His speech led to the crowd at least twice, while SNL members were confused, one shared: "The studio is silent."
West was chosen to replace the singer Ariana Grande, as her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West made many people confused with the song I Love it, in costumes like a Bottle Perrier.
West received the support of the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner. He posted on Twitter: "To give one of the bravest hearts: INVOLVED TO SERVATION OF THE COMPANY."
But the host Karen Hunter posted on Twitter that West simply “is acting in his own nature, and this is really great.”
“But I chose not to reward someone (by buying music or costumes, or supporting his ‘art’) because I believe that person is pursuing and propagating ideology is not good for my community.
He has the right to freedom.
We too," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, officially "the Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, but only followed the path of Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly known as Snoop Lion; or the legendary Prince music legend, had also changed its name to a symbol and later changed its name to Prince.
Suspects of murder in the shooting of people at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

The charges will be investigated by the Justice Service Office.
Star Game Game Kingdom Anger Criticizes About Male Toxicity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as sword sword swordsman Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy television series, Kingdom Games.
But the 31-year-old actor is quite angry with this heroic prototype and mentions that men on the screen like that will make young men feel that they must be strong.
Speaking to reporters The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed there was “something wrong here” and raised questions about how to solve the problem of toxic maleity in the #MeToo era.
Kit was newly married to his co-star in the Kingdom Game, Rose Leslie, 31, and admits he feels 'needs' to solve this problem.
“At this point, I personally feel I don’t know what we’ve done wrong with what’s called male,” he said.
“What did we teach men when we were growing up on issues that were in front of us?”
Kit believes that television may also be responsible for increasing toxicity due to the extremely male characters they build.
He continued: "What is the origin and characteristics of education?
What is taught on TV and on the street makes boys feel like they have to be men’s models?
I think this is really an issue of this era - how do we change?
Because there was obviously something wrong with our young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any more pre-television or extra-televisions about the Game of Kings, after the series ended next summer, while insisting that "it's tired of battlefields and battles."
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's film True West, which tells the story of a film producer and brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing when he decided to stop closing the Kingdom Game.
“I’ve met my wife in this series, which is the starting place for my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the lover of Jon Snow whom Kit played in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple held their wedding in June 2018, on the Leslie family campus in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new infections
China has announced the number of citizens living with HIV and Aids has increased by 14%.
Health officials say there are more than 820,000 people suffering from the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018, the number of cases was recorded as 40,000.
The vast majority of new infections are due to sexually transmitted infections. This is a major change compared to before.
Previously, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China was due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV along this path has fallen to almost zero. This is a statement by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and Aids in China annually increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV infection is a serious problem taking place in the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality is no longer considered illegal in China since 1997, discrimination against the LGBT community is still very common.
Due to the country’s conservative traditional values, the study estimated that 70-90% of men were finally married, despite having had sexual relations with men.
Many people are infected with centuries of disease because they do not fully use protective measures when having same-sex sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to provide HIV treatment to all infected patients in response to the disease.
Maxine Waters denies her staff's disclosure of Republican senators' data, underlining 'dangerous lies' and 'declaration'
U.S. Democratic Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected the allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information from three Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrats assert that these complaints are caused by "right" experts and sites.
“The lie, lies, and lies are even more contemptible,” Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
According to the report, the leaked information includes the home address and phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, from Utah.
The information began appearing online Thursday, due to an unidentified person at the Capitol Hill Parliament Building during the Senate hearing on charges of sexual assault against candidates for Supreme Court Justice officer Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was released shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pudit and RedState reported that IP addresses determine the origin of posts related to Mrs. Waters’ office and disclose information about one of her employees.
Waters continued to say, “This unfounded obligation is not true and is absolutely a lie.”
“The staff in my office have been compromised by identity, personal information, and safety due to these false and false allegations that could not have been revealed.
This unfounded charge is not true and is absolutely a lie.”
Waters’ statement immediately drew criticism online, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This statement of rejection shows anger," Fleischer wrote.
“This shows that she has no gas to become a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of an act that is not done by them, one should not be angry.
They are not challenged.
They have not been questioned about the motives of the accused.
They have to show calm and alertness.”
Fleischer appears to be comparing Waters’ reaction to Judge Kavanaugh’s response to Democratic critics and critics also accuse him of being overly angry at Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running for Waters in midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Big if true" he wrote on Twitter.
Waters said her office had warned "the authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false charges.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be given light," she continued, "and they will be held responsible for all actions that could be harmful and dangerous to any of my employees."
Review of Johnny English Re-invention - A funny useless spy by Rowan Atkinson
Now, it’s possible to notice a rather traditional trend in any new movie that has the British factor is to look for the meaning of Brexit. And the next episode of Johnny English spy comedy series is no exception. The series began premiering in 2003, as Johnny English and Part 2 as Johnny English - Re-release, released in 2011.
Will the act of ridicule on how useless we are to become a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, the limited capacity Johnny English spy with round-eyes and flexible facial muscles is allowed to disturb everything once again - his name simply represents a comic book designed for areas that do not speak English.
Of course, he was a secret active spy, though he always pretended strangely in the style of Detective Clouseau, mixed with Mr Bean's humor and something contributed to Chariots of Fire's theme tone during the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
The character's prototype also relied on the international traveler and mysterious man Atkinson had ever played in Barclaycard's television ad that now sinks into oblivion and causes chaos as he wakes up.
There are some interesting scenes in the latest Johnny English episode.
I like the scene of Johnny English approaching the helicopter while wearing medieval armor and the propellers beating on his hat.
Although Atkinson's humor is fully expressed, the funny element here seems to be not enough weight and a little excess, especially when "serious" brands such as the 007 series and the impossible mission has made the comedy just a spice.
The funny element in this film can only laugh at children, I myself think Johnny English’s stupid mistakes have nothing to do with creativity and are as notable as the jokes in Atkinson’s silent movie Mr. Bean.
The situation that leads the story is that England is in serious trouble.
The hackers have compromised Britain’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identity of all active British spies outside, leading to the dismay of a spy who is on duty, a very unfortunate little role by Kevin Eldon.
This is the prime minister's last chance option, a proud and powerful figure, now facing this political crisis: Emma Thompson has shown very well the prime minister's version character, but according to the scenario she doesn't have much land.
Intelligence advisers reported that the body of all active agents had been exposed and that she would have to mobilize a retired spy.
And that person is Johnny English, who is currently teaching in a rural area, but is in fact teaching off-program lessons to become secret agents: there are some pretty interesting jokes here, because English teaches students to be a rock-style spy.
English was called back to the Whitehall Court and reunited with former poor aide Bough, played by actor Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, please join a charming luxury submarine commander. Vicki Pepperdine takes on the role of a little bit of this talent.
So the Batman and Robin duo specialises in causing trouble with the Queen's orders to return to duty and meet Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful spy Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into danger under the curse of the charming tech billionaire after claiming he can solve all of the UK computer headaches: Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their adventures with imaginative clowns: after disguised as waiters, they burned a French restaurant in a blink of an eye; causing chaos on Volta's luxury yacht; and English made even more messy trying to use virtual reality headphones to explore Volta's home.
At the end of the film, the knots are sure to be removed, but such excitement is quite similar to the children's television channels.
A pretty mediocre work.
And as with other Johnny English films, I can’t help without question: Can’t the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a fair, worthy role with his talent?
Labour rejects information that is building plans to allow the British to work for four days but receive a five-day salary
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will look at a radical plan that will allow the British to work for four days a week but receive a five-day salary a week.
According to the information received, the Party wants the business owner to move the savings thanks to the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to workers by giving them another day off.
That means employees get a three-day weekend leave but still get the same salary as before.
The sources said the idea was "consistent" with the party's economic agenda and was expected to increase support for its workers.
The British Union Congress has confirmed a four-day shift to work a week is a way for workers to enjoy the benefits of the changing economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told Sunday Times: “The review process for policies is expected to be published by the end of this year.
“This goal cannot be done in a short time, but working four days a week is a desire to match the party’s agenda in rebalancing the economy that benefits workers as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to approve this idea. The British Green Party is committed to working four days a week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, this idea has not been approved by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “The four-day work policy is not a party policy and the party does not consider this policy.”
Dark Prime Minister John McDonnell took advantage of the Labour Conference last week to strengthen the vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the hands of the "unnamed governors" and "benefits" at utility service companies.
These plans of the dark prime minister also mean that current shareholders in state-level companies may not receive their entire stakes as the Labour Party government can apply “deductions” based on behavior considered wrong.
He also confirmed plans for workers to join the corporate board and create a comprehensive ownership fund to hand over 10% of private companies to corporate employees, from which they are likely to receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, on "60 Minutes" on whether the FBI investigation results on Kavanaugh led them to change their decision.
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote to appoint him as Supreme Court Judge for at least a week and raised questions about whether the Federal Intelligence Bureau’s investigation could lead any Republican senator to withdraw support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find some evidence that could make these senators change the decision.
Kennedy was more open than his counterpart from South Carolina.
“I think of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said during the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, i.e. after the allegations were made and asked 'Do you do that?'
He answered very decisively, decisively and decisively.”
However, Graham's vote seemed to be absolutely certain.
He said: "I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh and there is only one charge that makes me change."
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has denied it very strongly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all of the people she said were not able to verify the story.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizens Festival and what does it contribute to the poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive star cast to perform an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
In the seventh year of this event, the Global Citizens Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Reduction Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of active people struggling against poverty.
To receive free entrance tickets for this event (unless you are willing to pay for VIP tickets), music night attendees must complete a series of missions or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling a phone or any other meaningful form to help raise awareness of the goal of poverty reduction.
But how has this Global Citizens Festival achieved success, when there are now only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
The idea of winning tickets to see a free night of music for everyone is a practical way to convince people to call for action, or just another form of "keyboard movement" - people feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter post?
Since 2011, the Global Citizens Organization has said that more than 10 million "actions" from supporters are recorded, promoting a range of different goals.
They say these actions have helped drive leaders around the world to make commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion created to implement interventions that improve the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and notifications stemming from the group’s action, with at least $10 billion being disbursed or raised.
The estimated group so far, the secured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partner organization that includes investors and those committed to "helping children achieve their full potential," promising to provide $25 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 Twitter posts from the Global Citizens group.
“With support from the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustices that lead to a lack of nutrition into a mark in history,” Tracey Ullman told the audience on a live show in London in April 2018.
After more than 5,000 actions called for the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Nutrition Power, which ensures nutritional intervention for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the frequently asked questions on the team’s website “What makes you believe we can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizens Group responded: “This will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fail.
But just as civil rights chambers and anti-discrimination movement before, we will succeed because together, we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe are some artists who will be performing this year in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to "slow" Russia's energy exports - Interior Minister
U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said Washington could mobilise the Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from being brought into the market, including the Middle East market.
Zinke alleges that Russia's involvement in Syria - more notably at the invitation of the legitimate government - is just an excuse to explore the new energy market.
According to the report, he said: “I believe the reason they entered the Middle East was because they wanted to trade energy as in Eastern Europe, the southern Valley of Europe.”
And according to official news, there are many ways and measures to stop this.
“The United States has the ability to use the Navy to ensure that the routes are open and will close, as needed, to ensure their energy is not put into the market.”
Zinke has called on event participants to be held by the Consumer Energy Union, a self-proclaimed non-profit group that is "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that these two ways are equally effective.
“The economic plan that Iran and Russia can choose is to take advantage of and change the type of fuel,” he said, while calling Russia “one of the only strengths” with a fossil fuel-based economy.
The claims came as the Trump administration sought to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, in order to replace Russia’s position, much cheaper options for European consumers.
To achieve this goal, officials from the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of the "unfit" Nord Stream 2 oil project that Trump said has made Moscow "completely controlled" Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Nord Stream 2 oil project, built to double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project simply stems from economic reasons and is an example of unhealthy competition.
“I believe we share the same view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers must be selected as suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance caused a backlash from Germany, which later reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere with the European Union’s energy policy, as well as bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I face a big problem when there is a third country trying to interfere with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) said after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "Seriously consider" the 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts Senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after midterm elections.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running.
The Hill quoted her as saying, “It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix the government’s mistakes, and so need a woman at the top.”
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren criticised President Donald Trump at a meeting in the town hall and said he was “in the wrong direction.”
“I’m really worried about what Donald Trump will do to our democracy,” she said.
Warren directly criticized Trump and was nominated for the position of Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said "Of course the FBI must investigate before voting."
However, a Thursday poll showed that the majority of Warren’s voters did not think she should run in 2020.
According to polls conducted by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Studies, 58 percent of Massachusetts voters say senators should not run.
32% supported her campaign.
The poll found that more voters supported former governor Deval Patrick to run for elections, with 38% of voters supporting them and 48% protesting.
Other potential Democrats are named when it comes to the 2020 presidential election, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would make an official decision before January.
Sarah Palin cited Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome (PTSD) at Donald Trump's campaign
Track Palin, 26, served for a year in Iraq after his enrolment in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what she's going through when she's back, I can completely relate to other families also suffer from the consequences of PTSD syndrome and the damage our soldiers carry upon returning," she said in front of the crowd at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son’s arrest a “clear but no one wanted to mention” and said her son and other veterans returned after the war “there was a change, more thorny, and wondering whether there was respect for them and their allies, air troops, and all other members of the military because of what they had dedicated to this country.”
Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing others from reporting domestic violence and possessing weapons while drunk.
18 states and D.C. support the challenge of new refugee policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting the challenge of new U.S. policy that refuses asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and D.C. sent a brief collective text on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers who opposed the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace and Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Federation in August to oppose federal policy has not yet been revealed.
She said her lover "and the sons of his violent gang members" abused her but U.S. officials refused to ask for her asylum on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
Prosecutors of Grace states described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum applicants in the United States were when countries faced with issues of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. refugee policy goes contrary to 2014’s decision by the Immigration Appeals Council to allow immigrants who do not have their own documents to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine announced on Friday that the new policy “understood the state, federal and international legal system that has been decades away.”
"The federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered based on the specific events and circumstances of the requester and this obstruction policy violates that principle," the document said.
Prosecutors also debated in the short text that the policy of refusing immigration harms the U.S. economy, because immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “full supply of the necessary labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked judges to take the immigration application not to continue allowing refugees to flee the gang’s domestic violence and abuse in June.
"Only allow refugees to leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political point of view," Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
Refugees are never a measure of reducing all problems - even all serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubled in the race for survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly dire.
"It's really stressful," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while clapping about her son having a fever at a evacuation centre in the desperate city of Palu.
“Every minute, the ambulance carries another human body.
Clean water is very rare.”
People return to their destroyed house, pick up the stuff in the water, try to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were completely overloaded, following damage to the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, have broken his back and his shoulders are resting outside Palu Army Hospital. Here patients are treated outdoors due to strong aftershocks continue.
His tears burst as he recalled the feeling of a violent earthquake rocking the five-story hotel room he was with his wife and daughter.
“We don’t even have enough time to save ourselves.
I think I'm in the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family went to the town to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry and cry for help, but then I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to my son's wife.
I hope they are all safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘teaching’ by ‘protesting propaganda’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad on a U.S. newspaper referring to the common interests of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. newspapers for propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned an additional amount of money from China Daily to Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to interfere with the November 6 U.S. parliamentary election.
Trump’s claim that Beijing is seeking to interfere with the U.S. election marks a new stage in a campaign to increase pressure on Washington’s China according to what U.S. officials told Reuters.
Although foreign governments putting commercial promotion ads is completely normal, Beijing and Washington are now stuck in the escalation of trade, with evidence that they have imposed high tariffs on both sides’ imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China’s tariffs to retaliate in the early stages of the trade have been designed to target exporters in states supporting the Republican Party of the President.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-time governor of Iowa, the state that exports large agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote an opinion in Des Moines Register on Sunday, saying that China “is continuing its bullying behavior by running propaganda ads in our own free newspaper.”
“To try to spread propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and free press when placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, at the news counters on Beijing’s streets, you rarely find disagreements and won’t see any real reflections on the various Chinese opinions of China’s difficult economic orbit, because it’s clear that the media is completely under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers has avoided the offer to post" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating women from midterm elections with Kavanaugh’s case
As many Republican leaders stand up to defend candidates for the position of Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh in front of several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that they may be subject to intense reactions, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions surrounding this incident are quite strong, and most Republicans on the election list show they want to keep voting.
There are things we can’t do again,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he did not think that Senator Jeff Flake (Bang R-Arizona) pressed the button to allow the FBI to conduct enough investigation to ease angry voters.
The Washington newspaper, D.C., quoted Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the MoveOn progressive group on Friday: “Women won’t forget what happened yesterday - tomorrow they won’t forget and until November they don’t forget.”
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as marching on the Senate corridor as Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee chose to continue voting for Kavanaugh despite Professor Christine Blasey Ford's testimony.
“The enthusiasm and democratic motivation will be pushed higher than ever,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say that this motivation is already high; yes.
But it may be even higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29 often do not vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford publicly sworn in details of alleged sexual assault against the Supreme Court official, analysts say the public may have a violent response if Republicans continue to confirm it.
NBC News quoted Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee last week as saying: “This could become a mess that Republicans must resolve.”
“The problem is not just the vote of the committee or the official vote, or whether Kavanaugh becomes the Supreme Court Judge, but the more important is the way Republicans handle this election and how they treat the alleged person,” Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA, a Democratic support group, told the news channel.
However, Americans have disagreements about whether to trust Ford’s or Kavanaugh’s testimony, which seems to be more suspicious of Kavanaugh’s side.
A new survey organized by YouGov found that 41% of respondents were certain or could believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were certain or could believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of respondents thought that Kavanaugh could or certainly have lied to the testimony, while only 30% thought that Ford was sure or could have lied.
After Flake clicked the consensus button, the FBI was investigating Ford’s allegations and at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford was sworn in before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Marirez accused the candidate of being a Supreme Court judge who revealed his genitals in front of her when they attended a party during their study at Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor World Wide Web plans to start building new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is now launching a startup project that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend is called Inrupt, a company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid Open Source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store data and which permissions to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt project was to “dominate the world.”
“We have to start right away,” he said of the start-up project.
"Now is the moment of history."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows users to create their own "online personal data" or POD.
This data repository may include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries, personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all are available on a browser and displayed simultaneously.
The unique thing about this online personal data warehouse is that users have full rights to decide which type of information they can access.
The company calls it "the control of personal data."
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of the Inrupt project is to ensure the company equips the company with the right resources, processes and skills to help provide Solid to everyone.
The company currently has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that has been acquired by IBM, some developers have signed a contract to work under the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications with tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team didn't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether it's going to change completely or not because all of their business models can be upgraded overnight.
“We don’t need to ask permission.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote "The mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Association at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential name in the debate over internet neutrality.
Despite the launch of the Inrupt Project, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Association, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” said Berners-Lee.
St. Bernard Vann's Day to receive the Victorian Cross Medal in World War 1
The 100th anniversary of the Church’s only missionary day was awarded the Order of the Cross of Queen Victoria during World War I as a warrior who was held in his hometown.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 18 in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he died of a sniper four days later, and he never knew he had won the highest honorary medal of the British army.
On Saturday, two of his nephews revealed a stone celebrated during the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the two grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "a brilliant symbol" when the stone was on display 100 years after the battle to help his grandfather win the medal.
According to the London Press, on September 29, 18 Lt. Col. Vann commanded his battalion to cross Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick fog, under strong fire from rifles and machine guns."
He then plunged straight into the bullet and with the "great feeling", he led the battalion above, before falling into a rifle and knocking down three fighters.
Lt. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 18 - just a month after the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "act I never did, but there was humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann also placed a round of flowers after the Royal Brentwood Youth Band parade.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be part of the parade" and "the courage of a true hero will be credited with the support of so many people."
All night martial arts fans to watch Bellator 206, but eventually they only get Peppa Pig
Imagine you were awake all night to see Bellator 206 with a hard stand, but eventually refused to see the main event.
The show's introduction from San Jose said there were 13 battles, including six games on the main card and were shown live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as soon as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to fight, viewers in the UK were surprised when the screen turned into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel that they are not respected after they get close to the morning to watch the game.
A fan said on Twitter that turning the show into a child's cartoon is like "an unscrupulous joke."
“The government stipulates that martial arts content projections at 6 a.m. are inappropriate, so they have to turn into programs for children,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator when asked about the program’s transfer.
"Peppa the pig," that's right."
Bellator’s president, Scott Coker, said they are considering broadcast schedules to ensure that British audiences can watch the show in the future.
Mr Coker said, "I think if we play again, we can solve the problem."
“But on that side is 6am Sunday morning and we can’t handle the problem until Sunday according to our time zone, but Monday according to their time zone.
But we are trying to find a solution.
Believe me, when people change the program, there are lots of messages coming back and those messages are not very friendly.
We tried to fix it, initially we thought it was due to technical problems.
But in the end, it’s not because of government regulations.
I can promise you that this won’t happen next time.
We will reduce the number of matches to five, instead of six matches as expected - the year is the number of matches we usually offer and we have tried to provide the level to our fans.
This is really an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'poor' about sexual orientation
Olympic dancer Tom Daley shared that as he grew up, he always felt inferior to everyone because of his sexual orientation - but that was his motivation for success.
24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize “no one’s like anyone” until he learned.
Speaking on Lauren Laverne's Desert Island Discs, he said he had voiced the rights of gay men to bring "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The longtime rice host, Kirsty Young, has been on vacation for several months.
Among the first led by Laverne, Daley appeared as a abandoned person, saying he felt "poor" everyone, because "his sex was not socially accepted as his son and daughter."
“Until today, the feeling of self loss and difference still exists, becoming motivation and strength so that I can succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he had "something" so that people didn't be disappointed when he knew the truth about his sexual orientation.
The Olympic team won twice as an active campaigner for the LGBT community and he used his image at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to counter discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he was speaking out because he felt very lucky to be able to live openly without being distinguished and wanted to bring "hope" to others.
The world champions shared that he loves a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black.
Daley was married to an Oscar winner more than he was 20 years old last year, but he said the age difference was never an obstacle between the two.
“When you experience so much suffering as a child,” he attended the first Olympic Games at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it would be difficult to find someone who was the same age as he had experienced ups and downs in his life.
The couple became the parents of Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "worldview" changed.
“If last year you asked me, my goal is ‘I have to win a gold medal’,” he said.
“But you know, there’s more important than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after Robert's father, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was about to die and that one of the last things he asked was that they had a ticket to the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell you, ‘You can’t sit in the top row anymore’,” he said.
“I held your hand when you took your last breath and even until you stopped breathing and left forever, I couldn’t finally admit that you had to be invincible.”
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that it was my whole life's dream - jumping a bridge in front of a crowd of fans at the Olympic Games, really there was no better feeling than that," he said.
It was also an inspiration for him to choose his first song - Heather Small's Proud - the song that accompanied him during his training towards the Olympic Games and still moved him to hear it again.

Mickelson's lack of stature on Ryder's pre-season Saturday
American player Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to raise his pace to avoid this record becoming a sad experience.
Mickelson played during this two-year event 12 times, but Captain Jim Furyk left him in a reserve in a series of fourball and foursome games on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action as in the United States, the five-time player has to spend the day as a cheerleader and play the game in hopes of getting rid of the unpleasant feeling.
The 48-year-old golfer at the school was never the ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National golf course, even when he was at the peak, because the wrong blows here would suffer from a heavy consequences.
And if this golf course is still not enough to be haunted, Mickelson has to play on Sunday's match against his opponent Francesco Molinari. This week, Molinari takes a fight with recruit Tommy Fleetwood and wins all four games.
If the U.S. team, now losing four points before starting a series of 12 single matches, Mickelson’s game is extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his golfer and did not speak too much.
"He understands his role today, he claps on my back, his arms over me and says he will be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's very confident.
He is a legend and has contributed a lot to the team, in the past and throughout this week.
I could never imagine that he played two games.
I imagine more, but that’s how things go and we think it’s the right way.
He wants to play, like all of his other team members.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record, becoming the most competitive player in the Ryder Cup.
It could also be the end of his career at the Ryder Cup because the peaks in his personal record never appeared in this tournament.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and the draw, although Furyk said his presence brought invisible value to the team.
"He's funny, he's satirical, he's funny, he likes to laugh at people. There's him in the group really happy," he explained.
“I think young golfers are also happy to see him and this week is pretty fun.
What he has done is more than he has done.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the lead advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European Team, has had experience that even though his team has led a lot to enter the Ryder Cup's last single game, the results can be easily reversed in an unsatisfied way.
The Dane began playing in 1997 at Valderrama, in which their team, led by Seve Ballesteros, led five points ahead of the U.S. team, but ended up winning only at 141-2-312.
“You’ve always had to remind yourself that we’ve led so much in Valderrama; we’ve been leading a lot in Brookline and we lose, in Valderrama, we win, but we’re very struggling,” Bjorn said, as he was visualizing after watching the class of 2018 with a 5-3 win on Friday and leading 10-6 on the Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in the team that this is not the end.
You still have to focus on your spirit tomorrow.
It's good to play and play.
The tournament is not finished when the score is not on the table.
We have the goal of winning the trophy this year and that is our focus.
I’ve always said that he’s focused on his 12 golfers, but we also understand the power of your team, they’re the best golfers in the world.”
Happy about the performance of his golfers on the golf course, Bjorn added: “I’ll never tell you anything.
Tomorrow will be another war.
Tomorrow is the performance of each individual and will certainly be different.
It would be great to play in pairs and everything goes well, but when you play personally, all the possibilities of a player will be revealed.
It’s the message you have to share with every player, that they must be ready to play the best tomorrow.
Now a pair must be separated and each must be ready to play the best.”
Contrary to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to show better personal abilities than when playing in pairs, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas have won three points out of four.
Furyk himself had gone through both directions in major turning points on the last day, having been a winner at Brookline before failing while the European team was chanted as "Colored in Medinah."
"I remember every single word," he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the team in 1999, gathered and encouraged the players before the last day of the game.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’ll want to start as quickly as you see in Brookline, or as you see in Medinah.
When the result is following a trend, the matches in the middle will suffer a lot of pressure.
“We built the squad that way and sent the golfer to play the strategy and tried to make a feat tomorrow.”
Thomas was tasked with leading the team and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other European players in the first series.
“I chose this group, in that order because I believe it’s a way to get over,” Bjorn said of the choice for his single match.
Germany's new warships continue to be delayed in use.
Local media reported: The latest German Navy destroyer should have tried in 2014 to replace the former Cold War war warship, but at least the following year could be tried by the system of errors and increased costs.
Die Zeit quoted military spokesman: "Rheinland-Pfalz" test operation, which led the complete new Baden-Wuerttemberg-type destroyer, which was now delayed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the trouble after delivery had hindered this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-type ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the former Bremen-type destroyer.
This means that these ships will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-ship and anti-ship missiles, some stealth technologies, such as reducing radar, infrared and sound traces.
Other important features include longer maintenance times - which can deploy the latest destroyers far from national ports for up to two years.
However, continuous delays mean that these modern warships - which are said to help Germany control foreign countries - will become obsolete at the time of the start of use, Die Zeit noted.
The unlucky F125 destroyer became a sign last year as the German Navy officially refused to test the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
There is little information about the reason behind the return of the ship, but German media mentions the serious "software and hardware flaws" that lead to the warship being completely useless if involved in combat missions.
The software flaw is particularly serious because Baden-Wuerttemberg will be run by a fleet of 120 sailors - just half the man on the old Bremen-type destroyer.
At the same time, it can be seen that the weight of the ship increased significantly, resulting in reduced performance and limited future Navy upgrades.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship weighing 7,000 tonnes was thought to weigh twice the same warship used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also a serious problem.
The project is said to have made a significant amount of €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - while the initial estimated cost is €2.2 billion.
The issue of mobilizing the latest destroyer became especially important, as recent warnings about German naval power are increasingly shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German National Assembly’s Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy was “a lack of warships capable of engaging.”
The official said the problem became increasingly severe over time, because the old ship had stopped operating but had no replacement ships.
He complained that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's ships were eligible to join the Navy.
National Trust eavesdrops on bat's secret life
A new study is being conducted at a land in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use natural landscapes to hunt for food.
Hopefully these findings will shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study was conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, tracking the journey of common bats, soprano pistrelles, brown ear bats and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be located at important locations around the research site to monitor the activity of these bats throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Audio analysts will conduct an analysis of all recordings and determine the sound frequency of bats and the sounding purpose of each specific bat.
Later, maps and environmental reports of bats will be created to have detailed paintings according to the natural landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’ natural conservation adviser, hopes the results will help determine which living areas are most important to bats and how each species lives in that environment.
This information will help determine the benefits of animal habitat management activities, such as planting grasslands and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities affecting bat's legumes and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and light systems, fly trap paper, some chemical treatment methods for building materials, as well as pet cat attacks can also pose risks to bats.
It's not completely blind.
However, due to the habit of hunting at night, the ears are more useful than the eyes when snoring and preying.
They use a highly sophisticated sound positioning technique to identify obstacles on the flight path.
NTS is responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, and especially values bats.
The organization has ten trained professionals who regularly conduct surveys, tests and sometimes participate in animal rescue.
It even established Scotland's first and only bat sanctuary at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway. It is home to eight of Scotland's ten bats.
Land management, David Thompson said the land was their ideal territory.
"Threave is a great environment for bats," he said.
“We have many old buildings, a lot of great trees and a good living environment.
But there’s still a lot of mystery about bats, so work here and in other facilities will help us better understand what bats need to grow.”
He stressed the importance of having to check the lives of bats before conservation in the lands, because accidentally destroying their breeding pits could kill up to 400 females and vomiting, almost completely destroying populations.
Swimming is a protected species and the killing, harassment, harassment or destruction of their beans is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Fire Conservation Fund employee, encouraged the community to help.
"We still need to learn more about bats and with many species, we can't know how far away their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape and his lawyer preparing to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the sexual charge against him was "fake news" and someone "wanted to profit" by his name.
His lawyer prepared to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel for posting the allegations.
The Portuguese striker currently playing for Juventus was charged with raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday: The player is said to have paid the woman $3755,000 to keep her quiet about the incident.
In the video streaming on Instagram before 142 million followers hours after the allegations were released, Ronaldo, 33, said the report was "fake news".
"No, no, no.
What they say today is fake news,” the player won the Golden Ball title five times in front of the camera.
“They want to use my name to profit.
That's normal.
My name is famous, but that’s just a part of the job.
I’m a happy person and everything is good,” added male players and smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel on the allegations, calling it “an unacceptable suspicion of private life.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation due to "the moral damage to the amount corresponding to the severity of the breach, which may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a high-end guest room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the club, Ronaldo and Mayorga were said to have returned to the player's room. According to records in Clark County Court, Nevada, he was accused of raping her at the hotel.
Mayorga said Ronaldo had knelt after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" "good people", only "1%" were bad.
There is a document that Ronaldo has confirmed that the two sides have had sexual intercourse, but are based on consensus.
Mayorga also said she had come to the police station and was photographed in hospital wounds, but later agreed to mediate outside the court because she was "seriously retaliated" and worried because of "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to reverse the previous mediation decision as she continues to suffer from the alleged incident.
At the time of the allegations, Ronaldo was preparing from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but eventually this summer he moved to play for the Italian giant Juve in a €100 million transfer deal.
Brexit: He 'will forever regret' for losing his position as a car manufacturer
Business Minister Greg Clark said the United Kingdom “will regret forever” if it loses its world-leading position in post-Brexit car production.
He also added that it was "sorry" when Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union without further agreements, they would stop production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
Japan’s automaker said the delays at the border in the absence of an agreement could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 units last year, of which 90% were exported to other European countries.
"My point is that if Britain leaves the European Union in late March, we will have to stop production at this factory," said Marvin Cooke, chief executive of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have also raised concerns about Britain leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said it would close its Mini plant in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concern of automakers is the supply chain risk in the event of Brexit without another deal.
Toyota's production line operates under the principle of "just-in-time", with parts delivered by suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union every 37 minutes for order-based production lines.
If the UK leaves the EU without another deal on March 29, it is likely that disruptions at the border and the sector is concerned that could lead to delays and shortages of spare parts.
Toyota said it could not keep its inventory value over a day at Derbyshire factory, so it would have to stop production.
Clark said Prime Minister Theresa May’s Chequers plan for relations with the European Union in the future would “be precisely adjusted to avoid border checks.”
"We need a deal. We want a best deal, not only to ensure success in the present, but also to make sure we capture this opportunity well," he said on BBC Radio Today.
“The evidence from Toyota as well as other car manufacturers shows that we need to ensure the continued supply chain is successful.”
Toyota has not announced how long it will stop manufacturing, but in the long run, it warned that additional costs will reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately, workers will lose their jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a summoner of Unite union at the factory, saying his members are increasingly worried: "In my experience once I lost these jobs, there was never again.
A government spokesman said: “We have built an accurate and reliable plan for relations with the European Union in the future.”
The White House announces Trump and Rosenstein meeting could be delayed again
The White House announced on Sunday: President Donald Trump's senior meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could "go for another week" as the struggle over the case of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh is continuing.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the intervention in the Russian election, links with his assistants.
Trump’s dismissal of the deputy attorney general, which led to Mueller’s difficult to operate independently, has raised rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing headphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refused to report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House amid speculation that he was about to resign.
Instead, his meeting with President Trump, who was visiting the United Nations General Assembly in New York, was scheduled on Thursday.
Trump said he "does not want" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings between Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday, President Trump asked the FBI to spend a week investigating allegations against Kavanaugh, while delaying the Senate full vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, she said: “The meeting day is not set, maybe this week, which could see the reason for this delay is because other issues are taking place in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll get news soon and the press will be updated.”
Some reporters may disagree with the statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked her about this.
Sanders said that the absence of press conferences was not due to the dislike of television reporters "too many things", although she once said, "I also agree that reporters are actually a lot of things."
She then suggested adding a direct link between President Trump and the press.
"The president is currently making more sessions of answers than any previous president," she added without giving a witness: "We have looked at the number of press conferences."
Sanders said there would still be press conferences but "if the press had a chance to directly ask the president of the United States, that would be much better than talking to me.
“We’ve tried a lot and you see we’ve had to do a lot of things over the last few weeks, which will replace a press conference when you can talk directly to the president of the United States.”
President Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or at press conferences when he visits.
The press conferences are often rare.
This week, in New York, the president would have declared the reason, but he appeared suddenly in a strange form in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health Minister wrote to European Union employees working in the health sector in Scotland to talk about the fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to European Union employees working in the health sector in Scotland to express their gratitude and wish employees remained behind Brexit.
Health Minister Jeane Freeman sent a letter with a message that would resign within six months after the UK withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government is committed to supporting costs for applications for the status of residence of citizens of the European Union who are working in the public service industry that have been transferred.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union continue to take place, which is expected to be made this fall.
But the British government is also pushing up its preparation for the scenario that may not reach an agreement.
I know this is a time of uncertainty for all of you.
That’s why I want to repeat that now I appreciate each employee’s contribution, no matter what their nationality is.
Furthermore, colleagues from the European Union have brought valuable experience and skills to help strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we look forward to staying.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee-based Tigers side Christion Abercrombie had to undergo an emergency operation after having a head injury in the 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commotripes on Saturday, Mike Organ in Tennessee reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that injuries occurred just before the first half break.
“He ran toward the border and collapsed,” Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen breath at the sideline before putting him on the sniff and taking him to further check.
A Tennessee official told Chris Harris at the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been undergoing surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no detailed information on the level/type of injuries" and that Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student of the red shirt team, first played under Tennessee's shirt after moving back from Illinois.
He had a total of five games on Saturday before being eliminated from the game and he had a total of 18 matches this season.
Foreigners buying real estate in the UK will be charged with higher taxes.
Foreigners buying real estate in the UK will be charged with higher taxes, this extra money will be used to help homeless people follow Tory’s new policies.
This change will successfully disable Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.
The tax increase will apply to non-taxpayers in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this policy to help increase to £120 million per year - to help homeless people
Foreigners buying real estate in the UK will be charged with higher taxes - this extra money will be used to help the homeless, Prime Minister Theresa May will announce today.
This change will successfully neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters to the commitment to provide cheaper housing and target high-income audiences.
The tax hike will apply to individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, which will boost the government’s efforts to combat the current stagnation.
Fees - in addition to the current tax rate, including higher tariffs that were announced two years ago for the second house and the purchase houses just to that - could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects this change to increase to £120 million per year.
An estimated 13% of newly built properties in London have been sold to non-British citizens, which pushes home prices up and makes first-time home buyers more difficult.
Many of the country's rich regions -- especially in the capital -- have become "the ghost town" because most foreigners buy homes that spend most of their time elsewhere.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to help many young people get the opportunity to own their first home.
He accused major construction companies of holding high property prices by taking land but not using it, he urged May to give up quotas for affordable homes to fix "house accidents" in the UK.
Corbyn also announced a series of housing reforms aimed at attracting voters, including controlling rent and ending “no error” deportations.
He also wanted to give the council more power to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said that I would spend my term to restore my dream of England - that life would be better for the new generation.
And that means re-regulation of the housing market is very chaotic right now.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, this does not mean that people who do not live in the UK and overseas-based companies can easily buy homes as hard-working British residents.
For a lot of people, the dream of owning a house has become too far away and the stagnation is still huge.”
Jack Ross: “My last hope is to lead the Scottish team.”
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, said his "last ambition" was to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
Scot, 42, is facing the challenge of revitalizing the Northeastern club, currently holding third place in League One, which is less than three points from first place.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to play for my country as a player.
I had a hat with a B logo and that's what I wanted," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“My five-month-old was associated with those Scottish games that took place in Hampden with my father, and that was always what made me remember.
However, that opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing the club.”
Sunderland's predecessors ahead of Ross include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn’t feel pressured to be a successor after the great names at such a big club, who had previously rejected the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me now will be judged by 'Can I bring the club back to the Premier League?'"
The organization structure and facilities at this club are certainly part of the Premier League,” he said.
“This isn’t a task to achieve easily, but I just see myself as a success if I can bring the club back to the tournament.”
Ross has three years as manager, after a time as manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as manager at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa restore his position after falling to third place, and took St Mirren from the risk of falling to become the next season champion.
Ross said he now feels very comfortable throughout his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It’s probably a real turning point,” he recalls in his role as leader of Alloa.
“I really believe that I am more in line with the management role than a player.
This may sound strange because I was quite successful, had good income and achieved certain achievements as a player.
But the game is often not easy.
There are a lot of things you face every week.
I still have to endure the stress and pressure of the job but I am happy with the management work.
I always wanted to do management work and now I am doing it, I feel most comfortable being myself during my adult life.”

The survey found that the ideal time to enjoy a beer was 5.30 p.m. Saturday.
The summer heat has increased sales for struggling pubs in the UK but has added pressure to restaurant chains.
According to data, pubs and bars saw sales rise by 2.7% in July, but sales at restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s corporate consulting firm, sums up the figures, saying: “Slowing and England’s team into the round in the World Cup makes the sales trend of July similar to June, when pubs increased by 2.8%, restaurants were more heavily affected.
Sales at restaurants fell by 1.8% in June were worse in July.
Bars and pubs specializing in drinks have the fastest growth when compared to a drop in restaurants.
The pubs that specialize in food are also affected by the heat, although not as severe as restaurants.
It looks like everyone just wants to drink.
Drink sales at managed pubs and bars rose 6.6% in the month while food sales fell by 3 percent.”
Paul Newman, an entertainment analyst and hotel analyst, said: “These results show the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of big social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales at restaurants.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to have trouble, revenue fell 4.8% from the same period last year while cost pressure increased continuously.
Long-term heat summers have taken place at the worst time for food suppliers, unknown in August when the weather is cooler, can improve the current situation.”
The total revenue growth at pubs and restaurants, including newly opened locations, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the resellering of the brand.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s sales monitoring for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK has collected and analyzed work efficiency data from 47 active groups, with combined revenue of over £9 billion, and that’s the industry’s benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that parents don’t know
One in five children - some in their 11s - have secret social media accounts that parents and teachers don't know, the survey shows.
A survey of 20,000 second-level students found that the number of “Insta virtual” pages increased significantly.
The news has raised concerns about the rise of pornography online.
Twenty percent of students say they have “primary” accounts to show parents
A fifth of children - some 11-year-olds - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 second-level students revealed rapid growth in "Insta" accounts - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing page.
The news has increased concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a “main” account without bad content to show their parents, while also having their own accounts.
A mother accidentally found the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, and found a teenager calling on others to “be raped me.”
According to a study by the United Kingdom Digital Content Development Association and the Headmaster Conference (HMC) in the public schools, 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two records, and half of them admit to having their own accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers can’t find.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "representer of athletes" at the Scottish athletics board.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletics board as the non-executive director at the administration's annual meeting.
Doyle is the most medalist in Scotland, president Ian Beattie sees this change as a great opportunity for sports coaches to use her rich playing experience in international competitions over the past decade.
“Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and around the world, we’re sure that the Scottish athletics will benefit greatly by voting her into the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to serve as a representative of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead this sport in Scotland.”
An American who has won a gold medal running 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, he has all four Olympic gold medals, and he is now a permanent BBC commentator, who has not been able to walk after experiencing a slight accident.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I can't go.
Doctors say there is only time to answer whether I can recover or not.
It was a tired journey but to fully recover, to learn how to walk and now I can walk fast!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Advertising milk suckers compare mothers with dairy cows that divide public opinion online
A company specializing in milk suckers that divide public opinion online with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to milked cows.
To mark the launch of the product as “the wearable milk sucker and not causing the world’s first noise,” consumer technology firm Elvie has launched a satirical video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that new suckers bring to mothers.
The four moms danced in a grassy cow's barn in a song with lyrics like this: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tails and "In case you don't realize, this isn't my breasts, they're my breasts."
The chorus continued: "Drink out, suck out milk, I'm feeding the kids, sucking milk, sucking milk, I'm milking my girls."
However, this ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused much controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, this video has received many counter-reactions from the audience, many argue that the ad has a slight “horror” of the dairy industry.
“A bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they also have to be pregnant and have children to produce milk, except that the cows are taken from the cows within a few days of giving birth,” one writer wrote.

Another commented: “This can cause psychological damage to both mother and baby.
Yes, why not use it to advertise milk straws for breastfeeding mothers?”
Another commented: “This advertising is not relevant.”
There are people who also protect ads, a woman admits that she sees the song "it's fun."
“I think this is a unique idea.
I'll buy one for myself if I'm still breastfeeding.
Drinking milk really makes me feel like a cow.
This ad is crazy, but I understand its message.
This is a unique product,” another commented.
Another commented: “This is an interesting ad targeting mothers who need milk (usually at work or in the toilet) and they feel like “cows.”
This is not an advertisement that praises or evaluates the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women revealed that they had danced with milk suckers hidden in the underwear.
The idea behind this campaign is based on the fact that many women who suck milk to breastfeed say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie milk suckers do not cause noise, no wires or tubes, and lie neatly inside the breasts of breastfeeding, making women free to move, hold the baby and even go out while sucking milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: "The Elvie milk sucker is truly a revolutionary product, worthy of a bold introduction and encourages curiosity.
When we compare women with dairy cows, we want people to know about dairy products and related challenges, while also expressing a hilarious and empathetic way about the freedom that new dairy products bring to mothers.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s milk suckers have appeared on headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a two-parent mother appeared on the catwalk of designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children has spiked even though the number of monthly border crossings remains almost unchanged, in part because of the harsh reasons and policies set by the Trump administration that have made it increasingly difficult for children to reach donors.
Traditionally, most donors have been undocumented immigrants, and they are concerned that getting an immigrant child can affect their ability to stay in America.
The risk increased in June, when federal governments announced that potential donors and other adult members of their families would have to take fingerprints, and this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people applying for funding for unguarded minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had never had a criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of donors or family members are here illegally, and most of them have criminal records.
“So we’re continuing to judge these individuals,” Albance said.
According to employees working at refugee camps, to be able to quickly handle cases involving these children, officials have issued new regulations requiring some donors to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, according to the previous standard.
Many will appear through video conference calls, instead of being present directly, to justify their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who have been tried to be considered unqualified to be sponsored will be expelled quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more they become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent behavior or attempt to escape, according to employees at refugee camps and according to reports from the system in recent months.
Supporters said the growing concern at a larger facility like Tornillo, where they found that a struggling child is more likely to be ignored due to the size of the camp.
They added that bringing children to the city with refugee camps without allowing them to have enough time to prepare themselves or say goodbye to friends can cause psychological damage that many children are suffering from.
Syria proposes the 'occupied force' of the United States, France and Turkey withdraw from the country immediately
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to the country, although the civil war entered the eighth year.
Moualem, deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on illegal Syrian soil, as anti-terrorism forces, so "will be dealt with".
“They must withdraw from Syria unconditionally and immediately,” he said before the council.
Moualem stressed that “the war against terrorism in Syria is nearing an end,” with more than 360,000 dead since 2011, with millions leaving their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this jihadist until we purge terrorist groups out of the entire territory of Syria" and "the illegal presence of foreign forces".
The United States currently has about 2,000 troops in Syria, specializing in training and mentoring both Kurdish and Syrian forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 infantry in the country under war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the country was good enough for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "infusing irrational fear" that caused refugees not to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to allow refugees to return,” he said.
“They are using political cards for humanitarian matters.”
The United States and the European Union have warned there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political deal between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent deal between Russia and Turkey on establishing a neutral zone in Idlib’s last rebel region has created an opportunity to promote political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale Russian-backed Syrian-backed attack on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who were "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committee including the government and opposition members to draft post-war constitutions for Syria and pave the way for the election.
Moualem laid out conditions for Syrian government involvement in the committee, saying the committee's work was limited to "seeing the terms of the current constitution" and warning not to interfere with the elections.
Why Trump will win in second term
The logic is that President Trump will win the re-election in 2020 unless the impeachment process and scandals end the presidency ahead of time, as liberals are hoping.
This is obviously "The most dramatic of a presidential term!"
So far, there have been no signs of heat reduction.
Since 2014, the rate of viewers at Golden Hour has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News now has 2.4 million viewers at the golden hour, compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped the cable TV chart with more than 3.5 million viewers watching the main news spots.
"Although it doesn't understand, many people are still drawn as carcinomas," Neal Baer, who runs ABC's "Designated Survivor" television show, said of a cabinet secretary becoming president after an attack that destroyed the House of Parliament.
Nell Scovell, a former comedy writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: and “Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club,” has another theory.
She recalls a taxi trip in Boston ahead of the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
You asked why?
“He replied, ‘Because he made me laugh,” Scovell said to me.
This is an interesting thing in a chaotic context.
Of course, unlike what happens on TV, any Washington move can decide the future of Roe v. Wade, or the reunification of immigrant families and the global economic situation.
Only some television viewers have the privilege of choosing their channels.
Not only that, this is even more appealing than news items when you take six hours to see a group of experts argue about Bob Woodward’s use of “in-depth” information in his book “Fear,” or Paul Manafort’s $15,000 fur bomber coat (“a bragging costume,” the Washington Post wrote) and the sluggish in Stormy Daniels’ over-discision of President Trump.
I changed my view of Super Mario.
“One of the things he does is always give you something new every night that makes it look like a reality TV show,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of “Pawn Stars” when it comes to the cast and unexpected developments in Trump’s daily television show (such as a fight against N.F.L or praise Kim Jong Un).
You can’t miss an episode or you won’t catch up with the trend.
This week I had a conversation with Fleiss, outside Kauai's north bank house under the 80-degree heat, but he hid in his house to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t leave the television screen most of all when Brett Kavanaugh was in charge of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on the scale.
"I remember the days we made those crazy programs and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside poured into the most aggressive midterm elections for the race to the White House.
It’s not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17 election area is seeing a rain of cash, as the re-arrangement of the parliamentary area has led the two incumbents to race into the same seat.
The recent geopolitical rearrangement in Pittsburg district hit Democratic Representative Conor Lamb who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is racing against Republican candidate Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former District 12 in Pennsylvania, shares multiple boundaries with the new District 17.
The main map was re-planned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former counties were arranged for fraud in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new District of 17 has become a financial race among party finance organizations, the Democratic Committee on the National Assembly Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican Committee on the National Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb was a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election watched by many in March for Pennsylvania's 18th District Parliament.
The position was previously Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the county.
Political commentators rated the Democrats higher.
The U.S. has considered sanctions against El Salvador due to Chinese support, but has since withdrawn.
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing, Washington, almost no opposition.
President Trump met with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until business partners fired the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to summon U.S. foreign delegation chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "the recent decisions on not recognizing Taiwan," Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But the penalty was considered only for El Salvador, which received $140 million in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including the cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions on some subjects, will cause major losses to the country now having high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings are taking place, North American and Central American officials have delayed a high-level conference focused on security and economic issues to reorganize a similar meeting last year that has been seen as a step forward in an attempt to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials had announced that they wanted to continue the conference, which helped end the U.S. sanctions consideration for El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to speak at the conference, which is scheduled in mid-October, when it is signaled to take administrative measures.
And three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any tough message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their information has been confirmed by an external analyst who has close ties with the government and also speaks anonymously.
History of Research
The next bomb could be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on Trump’s act of obstruction of justice, which now has a lot of evidence in public records.
People say Mueller is turning his investigation into collusion between President Trump and Russia in the presidential election.
If there’s a party change in Congress, President Trump will have a lot of difficulties in Congress, just before preparing a campaign for voters, and even with those in the same party.
There are a lot of problems, I don’t mean the passing of President Trump is inevitable - just like his colleagues in Europe.
Both sides of the Atlantic coast need to make choices and this will affect the length of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to conduct a coup against Hitler, if the West agreed to fight and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre.
History revolves around such milestones, and democracy's unforgivable struggles will increase or delay.
Americans face some of these milestones.
What if President Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who controls Mueller’s fate?
Rosenstein has been sitting in the fires since reports last year about his secret record of eavesdropping the president and speculated that the president was not fit for office.
Rosenstein's witness to the Times is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the new F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he confirms to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
Above all, will we vote midterm for a National Assembly so that this agency will force Trump to be held accountable?
If we fail in these challenges, democracy will lose power for a long time.
But I believe we won’t fail, because I’ve had lessons in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish Czechoslovakia expelled to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that occupied our home.
She survived, migrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, she gave me the opportunity to light candles on the altar on the Sabbath.
With my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans' optimism of Ranger's team ahead of clashes with Rapid Vienna
Rangers played against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning against the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would give them the advantage of winning into the Group G of the Europa League.
The knee injury prevented the midfieldman Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believed Rangers could use that result as a pedal for the better things.
“It’s a good thing for us because Villarreal is a strong team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We’ve been in the game with the confidence we’ll win a point.
We could have won at the end of the game, but the draw was also a bad result.
They were probably good at playing better in the first half but we were counter-attacks in the second half and were better in style.
Next Thursday, it will be an important match in Europe.
Hopefully we could win three points but it would be a tough game because they had good results in the previous match, but with the fan's contradiction, I'm sure we could get through and win good results.
Last year was a difficult period, I suffered injuries and changes at the club but now I have a very good feeling.
Good squads, the players have good style with good training quality.
Hopefully we can continue to go deeper to reap a new season of success.”
Women are so worried about sleep loss due to retirement savings
Despite the fact that the participants understood what they were interested in, few spoke to family members.
About half of Nationwide’s research participants said they spoke to their spouse about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about this.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about this,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here are the steps to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your desires first.
Talk with your mentor and family to discuss where and how to be taken care of, as those options can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring Your Financial Advisor: Your Advisor can also help you make payment methods for those costs.
Your financial options for long-term care purposes may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, cash-value life insurance policies to help cover these costs or buy insurance with your own money - as long as you have money.
Prepare for legal documents: Avoid legal battles that may occur.
There are health care plans available so that you can designate a trusted individual who monitors the medical care process and ensures that professionals comply with your wishes in case you can’t communicate.
Also, consider granting your financial account.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure to pay your bills if you are not qualified.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your parents are in a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
List those details so that you are always ready.
“It’s not just a financial problem but also a doctor?” Martin asked.
“What drugs are there?
Who will take care of the dog?
“You’ve planned yet.”
The man shot several shots with rifles in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times by rifles on his way home during the night.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, stomach, and hands.
Police have described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an "expansive act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injury was not life-threatening and the police called for witnesses.
earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said the number of deaths is expected to rise.
Contact cut off, aid workers were unable to receive any information from the Donggala government, a northern area of Palu close to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some of the main events about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a capital that spans more than 300 kilometres (180 mi) along the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The capital, an administrative area of the province's management, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are two key sectors of the economy in the Sulawesi province, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also an important industry here, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been attacked several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also landed in western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt region and often has an earthquake.
Here are some major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of which were in Aceh province.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake occurred in southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, capital of East Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake occurred in one of the islands of Mentawai, off the coast of Sumatra, causing tsunamis of up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A minor earthquake hit the capital of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing damage and panic as people recall the destruction of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
The earthquake did not cause tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes have attacked Indonesia's Lombok Island, which killed more than 500 people, mostly concentrated on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of temporary tourists trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, intervened in a report on domestic violence and opposed arrest warrants, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to a police report, when a woman tried to call the police to report the extradition crime, he took the phone.
Palin is being detained at Mat-Su and has to file a $500 guarantee, according to the KTUU report.
He appeared in court on Saturday, claiming he was "certainly not guilty" of being asked to defend, according to the report.
Palin faces three Class A counts, meaning he can be imprisoned for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also accused of light B, imprisoned for a day and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the attack.
The case is currently in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, intervened in reports of domestic violence and possessed weapons in a state of unconsciousness related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 after linking his son’s violent behavior to PTSD syndrome after serving in Iraq.
earthquake tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power networks and communications have been cut off with the number of deaths expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just outside the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
The video is being posted on social media showing the time of the disaster.
Hundreds of people have gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu as tsunami hits.
Federal prosecutors are offering death penalty for NYC terrorist attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are offering the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and bicyclists on October 10.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" causing serious body injuries, according to a statement on the proposal for the death penalty, filed in South New York County.
Both charges could be sentenced to death, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury accused Saipov on a 22-year-old indictment, including eight murders, often used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and charged with violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "pre-planning and meticulous station money," prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried out was "peer, cruel, and inhuman".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevivic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego's family and friends Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian," according to the court's statement.
Five were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since Southern New York County executed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug providers but was eventually sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they were convicted of plotting to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electric seats on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, had no regrets after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on the phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang ISIS flags in the hospital room, police said.
He has not pleaded guilty to the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal defense lawyers who represented Saipov, said they were “completely disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.
"We think the decision to execute the death penalty rather than accept the confession of life imprisonment without the ability to release will only extend the damage of the event to those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence lawyer group had previously asked prosecutors not to deliver the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say the PCBEL FARAGE must take responsibility for Brexit talks
Nigel Farage announced that he would "citize the people" during a protest at a conservative party conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians must "feel the heat" from European skeptics - as one of the prime minister's MPs Theresa May suggested he should be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
Conservative party supporter Peter Bone said during the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom was ‘out of the alliance’ right now if Farage was Brexit’s minister.
But the challenge May faced by trying to mediate deep divisions among conservative MPs, supporting staying in the European Union, took part in a protest against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain a compromise plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, backers and the European Union.
Allies insisted she would push by trying to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the violent reaction - and forced European skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between her plans and 'the present chaos'.
Bone said during the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "reflect the Chequers plan."
He suggested Farage should be in the Senate and responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he's responsible, now we're probably out of the alliance," he said.
Wellingborough added: 'I will support Brexit but we need to oppose the Chequers plan.'
He testified to his opposition to the European Union: "We do not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to build our own laws.”
Bone rejected the proposal that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that British people have changed their minds and want to stay together is completely false.'
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, speaking to reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Not many people approve of the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for this plan, which often does not happen to our party, our activists, who are willing to call for the support of the people and vote for us in the first place.
Give up the Chequers plan and listen to the people.”
In a message to Mrs May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their seats when they keep their promises to the people.”
Farage said politicians must participate in protests to "feel the heat" if they change the decision made during the 2016 referendum.
"This is a matter of trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
“They’re trying to give up Brexit and we’re here today to say ‘we won’t let you do it’.
In a message to supporters, he added: “I want to let the political class, who are intending to change Brexit, feel the heat of the current situation.
“We are mobilizing people who have brought Brexit victory and we will never surrender until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour protest in the city centre.
Some activists raised the conservative Party banner against Brexit after launching the group this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives on security issues they were facing as the conference opened.
“These are those who have told us that they can control IT systems and all technologies provided to Canada, both borderless free trade in Ireland,” he added.
“This is absolutely a joke.
Brexit isn’t a good thing,” he added.
Warren plans to "sketch" the president's chair
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would be determined to "election for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future when speaking in the city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, was re-election in November, in a race with GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who served as co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
People speculate that she could take on Trump’s position in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall since President Trump took office.
One participant asked her about his intention to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to join politics to reform the government and need a woman to lead it.
Arrested in the shooting of the LSU team's Sims player
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect was arrested in the shooting of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11am.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in the head and died,” Sheriff Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, on sports channel 247.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, possessing weapons and confessing to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was immediately arrested and detained at East Baton Rouge.
As a 1.98m-high teenager and raised at Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 games in the official squad last season with an average play time of 17.4 minutes, winning 5.6 points and 2.9 times on the board each match.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won world championship after winning against Sebastian Vettel
Valtteri Bottas had an advantage over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes remained a strong team in the season.
From the starting point, Bottas had a good start and went beyond Hamilton to protect his position in the first two races and left Vettel to fight his own teammates.
Vettel entered the first pit and abandoned Hamilton when he re-entered the track, a decisive action.
The Mercedes came into the pit after Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead as the racer on Ferrari was forced to slow down in order to avoid risk after two steps to protect the third place.
Max Verstappen began in the latter row of the race and finished seventh when he finished his turn on his 21st birthday.
He then led throughout the race when he did not change his tires to reach his destination quickly and overcame Kimi Raikkonen to win fourth place.
He finally entered the pit in the 44th round but could not speed up in the eight remaining rounds when Raikkonen won fourth place.
It was a tough race because Valtteri played very well over the weekend and it was really a good racer.
Eventually the team had an excellent race to win number one and number two, "Hamimilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday's campaign because she insisted she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford on charges of the Supreme Court in Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault.
Speaking during the campaign on the West Virginia coast, the president did not directly target Ford’s announcement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was going on in the Senate showed that people “were bad and dishonest.”
“There’s been something happening and what’s going on in the past days in the Senate is great, you can feel anger, you can see people who are angry, ugly and uncomfortable and dishonest,” the president said.
“When they watch the articles and read the leaked news, they say, ‘Oh, I’m not the one doing it.
I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the news, right?
Remember her answer... she leaked the document, right? - "Let's go, what's the matter?
No, no.
I'm not leaking."
Come on, wait a minute.
We leaked... No, we didn’t do that,” the president said.
Feinstein was sent in detail by Ford on charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that her office leaked information.
"I don't hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I don't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
“She asked me to keep my secret and I kept the secret she asked for.”
But the president seemed dissatisfaction about her rejection and he commented in Saturday night's campaign: "I'm going to tell you about it, it's really a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t do that, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president said Democrats were using allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power in every way.
You will see meaning and discomfort because they don’t care who they will hurt, they want power and control,” Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars won 5-3 against Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants in the game against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up of a losing to Belfast Giants on Friday at the Elite League with a 5-3 win on his return on Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants team had two early goals due to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took home before Dwyer scored for Giants.
Francois Bouchard continued to remix Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals to help the team win the final.
It was the third time in the Elite League season led by Adam Keefe, which defeated Dundee at 2-1 in the Belfast match on Friday night.
It was the fourth encounter between the two sides this season, and the Giants team won three previous matches.
Dwy’s opening goal in the fourth minute when the clock was only 3:35 thanks to the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford helped Beauvillier double the goal apart just four minutes later.
In the early minutes, Sullivan helped the home team shorten the score at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became a player that helped Cownie level the score at 15:16.
Dwyer secured Giants' lead position in the first half when scoring the second goal at the end of the half.
The host team agreed and Bouchard again leveled the score with spectacular goals by 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead the match at the end of the second half and he scored fifth for his team in the final minutes of the match.
The Giants team has lost four in the last five games, currently waiting for the next game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controllers have lost their lives to save hundreds of passengers on board from the earthquake
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are being praised as a hero after their sacrifice to ensure that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers can take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a major earthquake occurred on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many people are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to keep their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower because of strong winds at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321 was on the runway at the time, able to take off safely.
He then jumped out of the air traffic control tower because he thought it collapsed.
Then he died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision saved lives, according to the Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he stopped breathing before the plane reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we receive this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, a spokesman for the national disaster relief agency said it is difficult to reach the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The number of dead continues to grow as many bodies remain trapped under the rubble and we have not yet reached many,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will host mass funerals on Sunday.
Military aircraft and commercial aircraft provide supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute there is an ambulance carrying the bodies.
Clean water is very rare.
Small markets are being sacked everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to support survivors but we don’t know how the situation is there.
This is a tragedy, but the situation can get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and said to the national army: "I look forward to all of you working day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, including more than 550 people.
Micronesia Flight Crash: Air Niugini says there is now a man missing after crashing the plane at sea
The flight operator crashed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, saying there was a man missing after a previous statement that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that until Saturday afternoon we were unable to find a male passenger.
The airline said it had worked with local agencies, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately request further information about passengers, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crews after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them remained stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact event chain remains unclear.
The US Air Force and Air Force said the plane landed in the seaside shortly after leaving the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had been missing the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
“This is a good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others could swim through deep water to the waist to reach emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and he suffered mild injuries at his head.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who worked nearby while repairing the harbor also helped rescue by using buoys to pick up people on the shore before the aircraft sank about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Data from the aviation safety network showed that 111 people have died in the crash of airlines registered in the PNG network over the past two decades but none has been linked to Air Niugini.
The analysis says that the time at night the girl was burned alive.
The original party was based on Saturday's record during a re-examination of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
US Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett has been testifying in court for hours as an intelligence analyst.
He demonstrated to the jury how to use mobile records to synthesize the movement of the 21-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers victim on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from some mobile phones showing Telllis was with Chambers in the evening she died, contradicting his previous statement, the Clarion Ledger reported.
The data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers’ phone during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified in court on Saturday and certified that he was not present in the town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis told the truth not to say that he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “declaring because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another conflicting detail is Telllis that he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records show that they only know each other for about a week.
Rowlett said that occasionally after Chambers' death, Telllis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and communications from his phone.
“He removed you from his life,” Hale said.
The defense lawyer is expected to start closed debates on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial of the jury that day.
High Breed: What is a hip hop?
The trio of hip hop artists want to oppose the negative views of this genre by bringing positive messages into their music.
The High Breed group, from Bristol, declared hip hop no longer communicates political messages and solves social problems.
The group wants to bring this genre to its roots and re-populate positive hip hop music.
Recently, artists such as the Fugees and Common Group have been more popular in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
NY Sister sues the couple who fired her after "racialist" message
A sister in New York Nanny sued a couple who fired her due to discrimination after she missed receiving a false message from her mother complaining that she was "a black man."
The couple rejected them as racists, calling the case a "demonstration."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her frustration when she discovered the new breast, Giselle Maurice, who was black on the first day of her arrival in 2016.
“No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman texted her husband so.
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent to Maurice twice.
After realizing the confusion, Miss Plasco-Flaxman "suffered" had fired Maurice, saying the African nanny was about to quit his job and that she hoped there was a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid on his own day and went to Uber home.
Now, Ms. Maurice is suing the couple to claim compensation for layoffs with $350 a day for the six-month period for the job she was hired to receive money despite not signing any contracts between them.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do things like that," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple opposed the allegations that they were racists, saying that Maurice’s end of employment was reasonable for fear that they couldn’t trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message she didn’t want to send.
She's not a racist.
We’re not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But can you give your child to someone you have offended, even by mistake?
What about a newborn baby?
Let's talk."
When comparing the case to a "deposit," Plasco said his wife had been born for two months and was in "very difficult situations."
“How would you deal with someone like that?
This is not something to do,” the investment banker added.
While the legal case was ongoing, the flow of public opinion quickly pointed to the couple on social media, slaying their behavior and the logic of the story.
Paddington is afraid that readers won’t care about the story of a bear who speaks, the letter said.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel was born shortly after the book was widely accepted by readers, the letter said: “It’s hard to put yourself in someone else’s place when reading the book for the first time was published.
It’s great to know now about Paddington’s great success.”
When it comes to his father, a BBC filmer before being inspired to write a book for children from a small toy bear, he still felt optimistic when his work was rejected, she shared more during the 60th anniversary of the book's publication, which was a "dissolved joy" after his death last year.
When talking about Paddington, she described as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father was always quietly proud of her success.
“You’re a pretty drowsy man, and you’re not an explosive man,” she said.
“But since Paddington really exists with him, it’s almost the same as you have a child and it has achieved certain success: you’re proud of them even if they don’t really exist.
I think you took Paddington's job that way.
Although it was the product of his creativity and imagination, he always won a certain position for Paddington.”
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
As soon as she landed her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life but were in vain.
“I called Nad regularly to say this was bad and she shouldn’t have to,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying she would stop breathing within two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you a lot, baby.
I'll see you soon.
I will always be with you.
Doctors have pumped heart medicine and slowly pulled the tube out of her body.
She stopped breathing several times and this was the last time.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was not closed.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because I was with my family and everyone.
I must be the one who binds them.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who is still suffering from the death of her daughter, has boarded the plane alongside other passengers who face the challenge she will have to overcome.
“No one knows,” she said.
“I bowed my head and cried all the time.
It was hard to explain, but when I was on the flight I felt sorry for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how long he loves her.”
The sad woman postcards to stop suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost suicide relatives are trying to stop others from robbing themselves of their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted cards on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis' son Tyler, who was 13 years old, suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to be in the feeling that I have to go through every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, living in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a grind smile.
“Everyone knows about it for that laugh.
They often say the boy’s laughter lighting every room.”
However, he quit his job before he committed suicide because he found himself “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, also left as his brother after his death.
Davis said: "I am constantly worried that there will be a chain reaction."
Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are always people that you can meet, chat, or even make friends.
Don't live in silence - you need to talk."
Humphreys, a friend of Davies for many years, lost Mark, his partner 15 years ago, shortly after his mother's death.
“He doesn’t talk about feeling bored or disappointed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he changed his attitude.
"He's got a boring mood on Christmas Day - when the kids open the gift and he doesn't want to keep an eye on them or anything around him."
She said that her husband's death was a huge loss for them, but they still had to try to overcome: "This caused a big hole in our family.
It's broken us.
But we all continue to live and fight with it.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is suspended as the FBI begins investigation
Mr. Flake said on Saturday that "I think, if we can actually get something like what he asked for -- a time-limited, range-limited investigation, we can collect a little bit," he added, adding that he was afraid that the committees would "be caught up in" partisan sluggish cases.
Why did Kavanaugh and Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their procrastination is just a matter of time.
Mid-term elections have gone through five weeks, on November 6 - as expected, Republicans who are now in very bad condition will be weaker in an attempt to find the representative they want to vote in the highest position.
George W. Bush called senators and lobbyed to support Kavanaugh, who was a former White House assistant under President Bush, who could have reached out to his wife Ashley, who served as Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will be held.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh could receive at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Mike Pence, now vice president, to remove the knot and confirm his position in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Koreans defecting under Kim
The number of North Koreans defected sharply since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean unification ministry, said last year there were 1,127 defections - compared to 2,706 defections in 2011.
Park said the tightening of border control between North Korea and China and the large percentage of smugglers arrested were key factors of the change.
North Korea has not made public comments.
Most defectors from North Korea were finally granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most defectors flee through China, which share the longest border with North Korea, and they can easily cross the heavily protected DMZ between the two countries.
China sees defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often force them to repatriate.
The relationship between North Korea and South Korea - technically still in war - has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on denuclearization.
The move comes after a June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, both sides agreed to expand to the North Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-Ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the delay.
“If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such a case, there is no other way that we will unilaterally find our own disarmament,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "arousal element," and said he was not suitable for the position in the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee for his position in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh as "too encouraging" and said he was temporarily inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help, but I think that if a woman has ever done so, they’ll call it ‘too encouraging’,” Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh insisted on denying allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as both minors.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh revealed a lot of emotions, and there were times when he almost cried and was sniffed when talking about his family and five months of high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democratic Party to the committee, calling for allegations against him to be a "seriously planned assassination" due to anger because Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was not suitable for position in the Supreme Court, as he clearly expressed his behavior against the Democratic Party.
"I think he removed his position when making his statements and treatment when talking about the Clinton family and the Democratic Party," she said.
Pelosi refused when asked if she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democratic Party won a majority of votes in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only in the Supreme Court, he's going to have to go to court," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at the Court of Appeals in D.C.
Pelosi added, as a Democratic Party member, she was interested in Kavanaugh's ability to make a ruling against the cash bag Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would change some Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not a time for a person to be overly encouraging, biased in court and hope we’ll say, ‘It’s not great now,’’ said Pelosi.
Women need to take advantage of it.
This is really a heavy criticism, month after month, year after year the greater anger, and she can’t overcome without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me after 45 years.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, and my friend?”
She continued, "I was very much helped by a woman, she was the senior director, she said she also cried when she was angry but to form a reaction when she was angry and started crying, she would tell the person she just spoke to, "You can think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And you continue to cry.
And I think this is great.”
You are allowed to cry so that this behavior is part of an escape for anger because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my deepest memories of working at the first company was that it was a place only for men, I once cried when there was an outburst of anger, which was when I was forced by an older woman - the cold manager who always made me feel scared - pulled me into the stairs.
She said to me, "Never let them see you cry."
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you are sad and happy because they are with you.”
Patricia Schroeder, later a Democratic woman in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and left the race, Schroeder was extremely disappointed, saying there was no reason she could not stand for the presidential election on her own.
30 years later she laughed and said to me, “It’s not a wise decision.”
“There were seven other candidates in the race, and they needed another candidate.
Some call this race "Snow White and Seven Uncles."
Due to her late participation in the campaign, she was lost in the fundraising campaign, so she swore that she would not participate in the campaign unless she raised $2 million.
The war failed.
She found that some supporters took her $250 instead of $1,000 to support the male candidate.
She asked herself, “Do they think I’m getting a discount?”
When she claimed that she would not launch an official campaign, she overcame her feelings - expressing gratitude to those who had supported her, disappointed with the system that made it difficult for the fundraising process and targeted voters rather than delegates, she was angry about being sexized - that she had come up with a bulge.
“You might think I’ve had a nerve decline,” Schroeder recalls how the press responded to her.
“You thought Kleenex was the sponsor of my company.
I remember thinking about what they were going to put on my gravestone?
“Do you cry?”
U.S.-China trade war could be a good signal for Beijing
Experts say the early rescues for the trade war between the U.S. and China have been stalled, and the war will continue, the rift between countries could be an advantage for Beijing.
Earlier this year, Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued its first warning by taxing China’s main exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The escalation has grown in recent weeks with a $200 billion ($150 billion) tax on half of Chinese goods imported into the United States.
Beijing has retaliated by raising tariffs from five to ten percent to $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China is committed to retaliating with U.S. action and the world’s second-largest economy could hardly be shaken early.
Getting Washington to make concessions means Beijing has to make requests, but publicly losing to the United States is a shame for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts say that if Beijing can offer the right flag countries, the long-term pressure of the trade war with the United States could be a positive signal for China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact is that a political decision in Washington or in Beijing can all begin an economic relationship in one of two countries and this is actually far more dangerous than what was previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an Asian-focused researcher at the Center for American Security.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, Foreign Minister declares
Syria says it is ready for refugees to return and is calling for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by the war for more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the national situation is more stable and secure thanks to advances in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to reform areas destroyed by terrorists to restore living conditions.
All current conditions are ready for refugees to return voluntarily because they have left the country because of terrorism and economic conditions that affect their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million others still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that fund the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 -0.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn won 14.5 points when defeating the American team.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who participated in most tournaments, threw his ball into the water at the third ball in the 16th hole, admits he has lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Mininari shines in all rounds and becomes one of the four players who have won 5-0-0 since the current season began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated at 5 & 4 by the lowest-ranking player in the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world’s top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of the British team, who may have played the last Ryder Cup match in his career.
A veteran player of eight Ryder Cup seasons, Sergio Garcia of Spain has become the greatest champion of every tournament with a total score of 25.
“I don’t always cry, but I can’t stop it today.
This is really a tough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing and trusting me.
I’m so happy to get a cup.
About my team, I’m glad I’ve been able to help,” Garcia said of feelings after European victory.
He transferred the torch to fellow John Ram, who lost American legend Tiger Woods at 2-1 in a single match on Sunday.
“It’s so proud to be able to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up and admired him very much,” Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup tournaments.
The statistics of one of the greatest players of all time showed that he won 14 major titles and was behind only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team tried their best to find tickets for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, first of which were highly qualified players of the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk said after his disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the players, they've fought very well.
This morning we had trouble due to high temperatures in Europe.
We've been eliminated.
Honored Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 players in the team play well.
We will regroup the squad, I will play the PGA in the U.S. and the Ryder Cup and we will continue to win the top of the table.
I love all 12 players and I am proud to be a captain.
I would like to greet you.
We played very well.”
Update on the phenomenon of red tide: Red tide density decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Association shows that the density of the red tide has fallen in much of the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC, the flowering algae phenomenon has been reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier particles, which have reduced red tide density.
The red tide spread over about 130 miles along the northern coast of Pinellas to the south of Lee County.
Small arrays are also found within 10 miles off Hillsborough County, but less locations than last week.
They also observed the phenomenon of red tides in Pasco County.
The average density along the coast or off the Pinellas County has been reported over the past week, the density from low to high off the Hillsborough County, the density from low to high in Manatee County, the low to high in the offshore density of Sarasota County, the density from low to high in Charlotte County, the low to high density on the coast or off at Lee County, and the low density at Collier County.
The phenomenon of respiratory irritation continues to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier particles.
The phenomenon of respiratory irritation was not reported in northwestern Florida last week.
