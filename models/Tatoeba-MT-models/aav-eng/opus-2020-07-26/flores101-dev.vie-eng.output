The blade of modern ice shoes is a double tongue, and there's a tree in between. The double knife helps its shoes to hold on to better ice, even in the corner.
By the lower part of the bending blade, when the blade turns to one side or the other, the edge comes to the ice as well.
This helps the ice slideers change their direction. If the wheel drops to the right, the slider turns across to the right, but if the shoe falls left, the slider turns to the left.
To go back to the initial energy level they had to remove the amount of energy they had from the light.
They do this by producing small light particles called "photon".
Scientists call this process "implaneous radiation" because atoms are encouraged by light, creating the radiation of the photon particles, and light is a kind of radiation.
The next drawing shows that nuclear is output of photons. Of course, in fact, photon is much smaller than in the picture.

The point of the lensing tube is the complexity of the brush and the number of lenses that need to reach the length of the length greater than the lenses.
This has become increasingly simple as those who produce the lenses have gained a higher standard of lenses.
This helps the lenses make images of the quality that can be compared to the image produced by fixed lenses.
