The steel floats on the water because of surface stress.
The surface pressure happens because of gravity between water molecules on the surface of the water is larger than the gravity of the gas molecules above them.

The blade of modern ice shoes is a double tongue and has a farm in between.
By the lower part of the bending blade, when the blade turns to one side or the other, the edge comes to the ice as well.
This helps the ice slideers to change their direction. If the wheel drops to the right, the slider turns across to the right, but if the shoe falls left, the ice falls to the left.
To go back to the initial energy level they had to remove the amount of energy they had from the light.
They're doing this by producing small light matter called "photon".
Scientists call this process "implant radiation" because atoms are encouraged by light, creating the radiation of the photon particles, and light is a kind of radiation.
The next drawing shows that nuclear is output of photons. Of course, in the context, photon is much smaller than in the picture.
The cheeses are even smaller than the atoms!
