Members of Parliament of Wales (AM) worried about ‘looking like puppets’
There are certain concerns of some Members of Parliament regarding the change of their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The issue was sparked by plans to change the name of parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of Congress at the conference are worried that this could be a matter of mixed opinion.
A Labour delegate said his party was worried that "the phrase would rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For non-native Welsh readers: In Wales, twp means temporary and pwp means feces.
A Plaid Party delegate said the entire party was "not proud" and suggested other names.
A Conservative Party delegate said his party had “no prejudice” about changing its name, but did not forget to mention how the abbreviation MWP could easily turn into Muppet.
The Welsh w is pronounced similar to the Yorkshire English u.
The National Assembly Committee is currently drafting a bill regarding the name change, stating: “The final decision on any identification of the members of the National Assembly will of course be of concern to the delegates themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 empowered the Welsh parliament to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a referendum on proposals seeking a consensus basis for the naming of parliament as the Welsh Parliament.
Considering the title story of the Members of Parliament, the Committee is biased toward the Welsh Parliamentary Assembly or the WMP, but the results of the referendum show a bias towards the Welsh Parliamentarians.
Members of Congress are openly offering other options, but efforts to reach consensus could be a concern for Election Commission Chief, Elin Jones, who is tasked with submitting the revised draft legislation in the next few weeks.
The proposed amendment would include other changes to the way Congress operates, including the rules governing the removal of members of Congress and the design of the government apparatus.
Members of Congress will give the final vote on what title they should be changing when they comment on the draft amendment.
Macedonian people vote in referendum to change the country's name
Voters went to vote on Sunday on whether they would change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The comprehensive vote was set in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long asserted that the name of its northern neighbor corresponds to its own territory and has repeatedly opposed becoming a member of the EU and NATO of yours.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a member of the opposition who changed the name of the country, has vowed to repeal the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the country’s status is a price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Church Bells Fall Into Silence When Crisis Happens in Harlem
“Historically, the elders I’ve been exposed to share that every street corner has a bar and a church,” Adams said.
“To this day, there is no church nor bar.”
He found that the disappearance of the bars was acceptable.
He said that today “people have many ways to communicate.”
“Bars are no longer public lounges where people come to visit regularly.”
As for the churches, he was concerned that the money from the sale of the property would not be as sustainable as the leaders expected "and sooner or later it would all be back at the starting line."
He added that these churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with many apartments of the local peoples, which would not help in the preservation of the local sanctuary.
He added: “A small part of the people who buy apartments in those apartment buildings will be white people, and then the prospect of closed churches will come faster than ever because there is no reason why the residents of those apartments will become lay people here.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black municipality – the Metropolitan Community in the 1870s, becoming St. Martin’s a decade later.
The first white Methodist congregations moved in the 1930s.
A congregation of colored worshippers nearby took over the site.
St. Martin’s was taken over by a black congregation under the administration of Father John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a shopping mall street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or urging people of color.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building badly, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they set up the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s, proudly called the bell “the bell of the poor.”
The bell operator in July preferred to call it “a cultural treasure” and “an invariable historical treasure.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first ring of bells in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who pursued the larger ring at Riverside Cathedral 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin’s did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin’s over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some given by lay leaders in the church, others by the diocese of the Neo-Catholics.
The diocesan administration – the parish’s governing body, composed of lay leaders – referred to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese “will seek to transfer costs” to the diocesan administration, although they have nothing to do with hiring the architects and contractors that have been mentioned.
Some parishioners are unhappy about the lack of transparency on the diocesan side.
Sharks attack 13-year-old boy who snorkeled to catch lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while snorkeling for lobsters in California on Saturday, the first day of the shrimp harvest, authorities said.
The incident occurred before 7 a.m., just off the coast of Beacon’s at Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he was driving with his friends for about half an hour that Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help and then all went out to swim and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought it was just a shout of delight when he caught the shrimp, but then he "realized that the boy was shouting: 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
The boy’s entire collarbone was revealed,” Hammel noticed as soon as he reached the boy.
"I'm asking people to get out of the water right away: 'There's a shark there!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where the boy was under insurance, in critical condition.
The shark was the culprit in an unidentified attack.
Rescuers Capt. Larry Giles told a news conference that they found a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but they determined it wasn’t a dangerous shark.
Giles further mentioned that the victim suffered a serious injury to his upper body.
Officials have closed beach entrances from the Ponto Sea direction in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas within 48 hours of birth for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles revealed that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's strategy to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s is pushing for Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with traditional display-style beauty booths, where there are always assistants.
As part of a massive push into the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which is continuing to grow as sales of fashion and household goods decline, larger beauty salons will be tested in 11 stores nationwide and scaled up in more stores next year if there are positive signs.
The investment in beauty goods comes as supermarkets look for ways to take advantage of alternative stalls for TV counters, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it doubled its beauty product size to 3,000 for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawwaw.
Available brand chains such as L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have additional space and brand sales areas similar to those displayed in stores like those at Boots.
The supermarket is also re-invigorating its Boutique makeup line so that the majority of the products are plant-based, which is increasingly sought after by younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the discount at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and shifting toward buying small amounts of daily food at local convenience stores means supermarkets have to focus more on attracting customers.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said the stalls will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to confront Aldi and Lidl’s offers with more non-food services and items.
Sainsbury’s, which has put Argos’ stalls in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats stalls since they bought both brand chains two years ago, has boosted grocery sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
The supermarket had previously tried to enhance its beauty and pharmaceutical arrays but failed.
Sainsbury’s experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after problems related to how to divide revenue from grocery stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold 281 of its pharmaceuticals to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a part in the plan, by strengthening a range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve transformed the look and feel of the beauty line to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialized training for employees who will directly give advice.
“Our wide range of brands are designed to suit all attractive needs and environments as well as convenient locations, meaning we are now an attractive stopover, challenging the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was "infuriated" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal in her stylish brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their Truly interior brand and accessories.
The couple’s business is like Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
This Morning’s 37-year-old host took to Instagram to announce she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons’ Den, prompting star Peter Jones to resent when she pulls out of their super-profit style brand business at the last minute – to focus on her own lucrative new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
At a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, sources said Jones was “angry” when the show’s golden girl admitted that her new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant she no longer had time to devote herself to their furniture and accessories brand Truly.
The business is like Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left the UK for one of his vacation homes.
A source said: “To date, Truly is Holly’s top priority.
It would have been her long-term future that would have been with her in the next few decades.
Your decision to leave is amazing to everyone involved.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, which is very close to the launch.
There’s a warehouse full of cargo at Marlow’s headquarters ready to launch.”
Experts believe the departure of host This Morning, one of Britain’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions of dollars for investing heavily in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and interiors, and the possibility of reversing the timing of the product’s launch.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin became close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together and Jones had a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's host I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we will not comment on his business."
It’s a great fight to “love each other deeply.”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unlike a man in power" for seeing the North Korean leader optimistically.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a “show host” tone.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June when Trump hailed it as a major step forward in denuclearization in North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Ministry head Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "satisfactory response" from the United States to North Korea's first disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his campaign speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We’re going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people could be killed.
We are now in this good relationship.”
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results – ending missile tests, helping free hostages and returning the remains of U.S. servicemen back home.
And he defended his unusual approach when it came to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this cramped area, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia destroy the island and kill hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has gone missing, no national disaster claims have been made, a precondition for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very decisive in not asking for international aid, so that’s very challenging,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a group to move to Palu, they are not yet sure if foreign employees can work in the area.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies were allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Despite the ongoing earthquake situation that Indonesia has been experiencing, the country has not been thoroughly prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, such places were not common at other locations.
Although the warning was effective, the lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu was likely to lead to human losses.
At peak times, travel between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Disaster makes logistics even more complicated.
An ambulance train has stayed at Lombok to treat earthquake victims seeking to reach Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s old infrastructure a centerpiece of his election campaign and has squandered funds on road and rail construction.
But the financial shortfall has made it difficult for Joko’s administration as he faces re-election next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from the unresolved sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority pursue a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were washed from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs clashed on the streets, using machetes, bows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge brings a draw for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London with a goal in the 89th minute.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri in a position 30m away from Chelsea when his team was 1-0 ahead.
He dealt the ball with his left foot before launching a shot into the longitudinal column.
Drop and head to the high right corner of the frame.
The ball crossed Kepa Arrizabalaga's reach and flew straight into the net.
“I’m simply in the right position, getting the ball and the players, including Shaq, are always trying to go up, so I just need to get up,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming in, so he handled a touch and shot without much hesitation."
Chelsea led nearly half of the match after the opening match of Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
During this phase, the Royal Cavalry striker passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic before moving around the midfield area and rushing up Liverpool's pitch.
Kovacic had a bounce from the middle of the pitch.
He had a beautiful slot-trick, heading for Hazard that was rushing into the forbidden area.
Hazard removed the defence and ended with his left foot on the corner of the goal, surpassing Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
The match between Liverpool and Napoli in the Champions League group stage will take place at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3 p.m. on Tuesday in London.
Human losses from the Indonesian tsunami reached 832.
The death toll from earthquakes and waves in Indonesia has risen to 832, the National Disaster Center announced early Sunday.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the rubble of buildings brought by Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which triggered waves as high as 20 feet, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the center.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, is engulfed in the rubble of buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing a woman
After the discovery of the body of a woman discovered this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, an investigation into the murder has begun.
The 44-year-old was discovered at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, with stab wounds, after which a 32-year-old male suspect was arrested.
The police called on the locals if they saw or heard anything, to come to the press.
Investigative police Brian O’Hagan said: “The new investigation is in its first phase but I call on anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to let us know if you’ve seen or heard anything suspicious.
I also appeal to anyone, especially the drivers, if they have inadvertently saved anything from the travel angles that will contact us because they can get important information for our investigation.”
Police identified the woman as a local resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the house.
This afternoon, some people who were known to have had sex with the woman went to the scene to get a statement about where the victim was in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police say they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return home, but police said no one was allowed to leave or enter the building.
He didn’t say anything when he found out.
Residents were told it would take several hours until they were allowed to turn in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
An emotional woman came to the scene.
She kept saying, “That’s terrible.”
At two o’clock in addition to the police cars in the blockade area, there was another car on the outside.
A lot of police were inside the block, keeping an eye on the apartment.
Anyone with information please contact DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or call the Crime Prevention at 0800 555 111 24/7 from September 30.
Congress' Cromwell statue becomes the latest memorial to 'rewrite history' story
Exclusion would be like the poetic justice of the Taliban’s destruction of many Puritan fanatics who followed him, when they destroyed countless British architectural and religious works.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's words as "crazy" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It is inevitable that the debate about leaving the Oliver Cromwell statues outside Westminster Palace will become the focus today.
The symbol of the civil wars in Britain was not ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell would have been wrongly replaced by Thomas’s father’s actions in the last century.
Cromwell’s representative, Sir William Hamo Thassycroft, is evidence of 19th-century opinion and is part of the history of a figure that many believe still deserves to be honored.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than now, Cromwell is considered by many to be someone who defends Congress against external pressure, in his mind of course the monarchy.
Whether it’s a perfectly accurate case for the topic in the ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the next development of our country and Cromwell was a typical figure in division.
His achievements as the Defender of God are also worthy of honor and recognition.”
Chinese Farmer Attacked by Pig
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, known as "Yuan", was found dead with a broken artery, his whole body bleeding near a barn in a market in Luo Van Thuy, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a slaughterhouse on May 30, 2005 in Tay Ninh, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly moved with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found out that he had died, and saw a door in the pigsty next to him open.
He said in the cage was a large male pig with a blood stain around his snout.
The report of a forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked the farmer to death.
“My brother’s legs are bloodied and not intact,” his cousin, known as “Wu,” told Guiyang Evening News.
Security cameras showed Yuan arriving at the market about 4.40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
About an hour later, he was found dead.
The killer pig is not the pig in the pigs of the two brothers.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market’s regulator are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Though uncommon, the case of pigs attacking people has been documented before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the husband badly injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig crushed a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife threatened the animal to flee.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were not usually aggressive, but that the smell of blood could serve as a bait.
“They just want to be close.
“They are reserved, very curious ... they don’t want to hurt anyone.
You just have to be kind to them,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa carry heavy rain on a wide scale to the Southwest of the United States.
It is forecast that Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it makes its way towards colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry torrential rains across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, Hurricane Feng Shui Level 1, as of 05:00 am Eastern Sunday, and was determined 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure began to form over the Pacific Ocean and moved east to the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approached the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm formed, it would begin to carry much of the northern humidity into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, low-pressure humidity will cause heavy rainfall to spread in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall from 1 to 4 inches will cause dangerous flash floods, debris streams and even the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The humidity will cause rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour at the peaks, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to reach between 2 and 4 inches in southwestern areas, especially across a wide area of Arizona.
Sweepsweeps can occur when the situation deteriorates rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
The situation will be extremely difficult if you risk walking into the desert when there is a threat from tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn the canyons into intense rivers and thunderstorms that will carry local gusts and dust cyclones.
Low pressure will carry some heavy local rains on the coast of Southern California.
Total rainfall can reach more than half an inch, easily causing debris lines and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains began to pour into Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before rain became more common late on Mondays and Tuesdays.
Heavy rain will hit the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
It is possible to see some extreme temperatures across the United States in October as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in temperature in nearby localities.
A typical wallet of significant temperature differences in the central U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference is nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat and the problem will be recreated and strengthened again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October with temperatures common in around 80 Southern Plains to the Northeast.
New York City temperatures could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Long-term weather forecasts are showing a high likelihood of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's testimony
More than 20 million people watched Thursday’s hearing on six television systems of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continues, with broadcasters disrupting regular broadcasts with last-minute sensational news on Friday: an agreement put in place by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a calm move, said he was 100 percent sure that didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing, Nielsen pointed out in the report on Friday.
The company counted average viewers on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures are not immediately included with other broadcasters including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has some problems when it comes to calculating viewers in the office.
To account for the correlation, the number of spectators is similar to for a last-ditch ticket match or an Oscar Award.
Fox News, which hosts the show’s strong support for Kavanaugh’s appointment, led all broadcasters with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
There is still a lot of concern after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the noise on Friday.
After the moderate Republican announced that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was tracked by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning that he was screamed by protesters as he tried to move the elevator to a hearing by the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes when he was questioned, televised live on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the whole country?”
He was accused of, "you have power while too many women are powerless."
Flake said before the elevator closed that his office had issued a statement, that he would have much to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and television stations went live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee would have to vote on whether Brett Kavanaugh was nominated.
But Flake said he would only do so knowing that the FBI would review the allegations against the candidate next week, something some in the minority Democrats have urged.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his colleague, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was heavy, as it was clear that the Republican Party would not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May Rejects ‘Political Postcard’ Criticism for Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May dismissed the criticism of plans to leave the European Union as a “political post” on Britain’s future and undermined national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Meeting in Birmingham, England, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside her on the front page of the newspaper, former Secretary of State Boris Johnson stressed his response to their so-called Chequers deal over Brexit, arguing that the UK and EU proposal to collect each other’s tariffs was “absolutely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who plays for LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained for second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims fell on his glasses during the clashes.
Police found the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on the glass, according to CBS' WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
The bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The Baton Rouge Regional Examination Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a bullet wound from the head to the neck.
The department is relying on Louisiana state police, anti-escapation special operations forces, state police crime labs, Southern University police and area residents to assist in the investigation of the arrest.
LSU’s physical director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement for “the diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims is only 20 years old.
The six-foot-tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 beatings per game last season.
On Friday morning, basketball coach LSU Will Wade said the team was "diggled" and "blinked" by Wayde's death.
Mr. Wade said, “That’s what you’ll always have to be on the wing.”
Volcanoes erupting in Mexico City
Ash emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano has flowed to the neighborhoods south of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the volcano became active and recorded 183 emissions and ash within 24 hours.
The center has been monitoring multiple bouts of fluctuation and shaking.
Images on social media show thin layers of ash that obscure the car windshield layers in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in volcanic activity 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The "Don Goyo" volcano has been in operation since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, as thousands of protesters marked the first anniversary of voting on both sides of Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked separatists are kept by riot police with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds on the streets often crowded with tourists.
The fighting broke out at the end of the day when police used batons to suppress the fighting.
For hours, the pro-independence party chanted "Not Forgotten, Not Forgivable" against protesters who protested against the words, "Great Spain".
Fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries during the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remained high in the region following an independent referendum on 1 October that was deemed illegal with Madrid but welcomed by Catalan separatists.
Voters in the direction of independence are overwhelmingly dominant, despite low approval ratings for anti-separatists who largely boycott the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote from taking place at polling stations in the region amid violent clashes.
Independent supporters camped through Friday night to prevent a rally in support of the national police.
The protest took place first, but was forced to take place in a different way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia’s prospects for independence.
“Last year we had the best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy to be able to vote but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite a close win in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence supporters have struggled to stay motivated this year with many of their most famous leaders either being left out of the country or detained awaiting trial for their role in holding a referendum to declare independence later.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who returned to the pro-police rally on her phone, said the conflict had been quelled by politicians on both sides.
“The story is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison before his trial since late last year, announced he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“Joining as a candidate for the European election is the best way to denounce a setback in the democratic and repressive values we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested in Car Crash
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car repeatedly rushed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Investigative police officer Bob Blemmings said the incident caused damage to the gates and the building itself.
There were shots pointing at the car at some point.
Menga's shot gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's lead makes Livingston sure of winning
Livingston is up to surprise Rangers as the Ibrox home team is led by Steven Gerrard with just two losses in 18 games.
Dolly Menga’s goal-scoring phase proved different when Gary Holt’s side raised Hibernian’s reach in a matter of seconds.
Gerrard's side have yet to score a separate goal in the Premier League this season and face the Hearts oil leaders, who are eight points ahead, on Sunday.
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended his unbeaten streak in six games, as head coach Holt has tasted defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed his chance to play against the underdogs.
Holt’s team should have been ahead of them before they scored, with their face-to-face tactics putting Rangers in a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson struggled but surpassed the goal, after which Alan Lithgow was only able to direct his efforts stronger after leading the ball to Craig Halkett across the goal.
The hosts confidently let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can cause problems for the visitors with personal techniques.
And that’s the strategy for a fixed score.
Rangers gave a free kick and Livingston led the way, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up on Menga, who had the touch of the ball and scored right in the middle of the goal.
At this point, the Rangers were dominant in keeping the ball but found the defences impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely had any difficulty,
The battle continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos received assistance from Kelly.
Scott Pittman lost at the feet of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow moved on to another game scenario by Livingston.
The shots led the ball continuously into Livingston's goal and were continually briefed, as two penalties - following Halkett's challenge to replacement Glenn Middleton, one because of the touch on the ball - were successfully thwarted.
'label' with Livingston - analysis
From BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A result and competitive match for Livingston.
The team is excellent, continuing to reach far beyond expectations in the backstroke.
Their playing style and players have rarely changed since they returned to the top, but considerable merit must be given to Holt because of the way he has honed the team since his appearance.
You have too many strong players.
Captain Halkett was the covert, arranging a well-organized defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As they did under Gerrard, they did not meet those standards.
The last shot was missing – the only chance to open the home field – and it was a wake-up call for Rangers, the team that landed in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received a number of accolades in Cologne.
There were smiles and favorable weather on Saturday when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – aimed at mending relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to attend the inauguration of a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters were also nearby to meet with their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also spoke out, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The two-polar protests reflected the split of a guest who was hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and was reviled by others as an autocrat.
Deptford accident: Bicyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy neighborhood in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The crash came months after another cyclist was killed in a car crash and fled on Childers Road, about a mile from Saturday’s crash.
Police said they were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads are blocked and buses are transferred and participants are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in violence
Six employees were injured in a riot in a prison for men with strict security, the prison officer said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday morning and is still ongoing.
The "Tornado" experts were brought to deal with the war, which ended around 17:30.
Officers were examined at the scene with minor injuries.
A spokesman for the Prison Management Board said: “Specialized training camp personnel have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six injured employees were treated.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that the individuals involved will be transferred to the police and may spend longer after the trauma.”
HM Long Lartin Prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the nation’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison overseer had been treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious rebellion in which employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Flooding Through (Positive Flooding Areas)
It’s rare that tropical depression strikes Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week as the energy trails of Hurricane Rosa in the Southwest Desert remain, resulting in flash flooding risks.
The National Weather Service released flood monitoring Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to follow a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, but earlier on Monday night there were thunderstorms.
The National Bureau of Meteorology in Phoenix mentioned in a news release that only "ten tropical cyclones have formed tropical cyclones or tropical depressions within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of landfall on the Arizona border.
The latest forecast models from the latest National Hurricane Center predict rainfall as high as 2 to 4 inches, with flood levels separated by up to 6 inches at the Mogollon Belt in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, will likely flood from 1 to 2 inches, with separate levels of flooding up to 4 inches.
For areas that are not flooded suddenly, the rain from Hurricane Rosa can be a good omen because the region is drought-stricken.
Although flooding is a deep concern, some waterfalls can still be happy to welcome because the Southeast is suffering from drought.
According to weather.com, only more than 40 percent of Arizona is suffering from the lowest extreme drought, but it is still the second highest in the same category.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s passage left landslides across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still in the storm range with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm hit colder currents in the Pacific Ocean and weakened.
As a result, it is forecast that there will be landslides in Mexico as the tropical depression passes by Monday evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be significant, signaling the possibility of flooding is not small.
According to Weather.com, “Total rainfall is estimated at 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to north-west Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches.”
Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday in the form of a tropical depression, which will then sweep through Arizona and make landfall in southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger forecasted from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, Northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods and waterslides that endanger lives in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Suspects Intentionally Murdered Have Been Arrested
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area at Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. on Saturday morning.
He was taken to the hospital in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset regions, police said.
Officers have urged everyone if they can keep any footage related to the incident, go to the press.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘suffered the selfishness, anger’ of Democrats
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the cruel and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the selfishness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his candidacy.
Kavanaugh confronted Congress on Thursday, strongly and vehemently denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades before they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's excellence and quality and courage" that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm that one of the most brilliant legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a resume, serves the true public,” he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president mentioned the details of Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy when talking about the importance of voting for Republicans in the midterm elections.
There are only five weeks left until one of the most important elections in life.
I’m not running, but I’m running,” he shared.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere to fight for bright candidates.”
Trump said Democrats want “restriction and obstruction.”
The first core procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh’s candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican leadership aide revealed to CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia, damage still rising
At least 384 people have been killed, many washed away as huge waves hit the beaches, as a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia’s island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered during a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six metres (18 feet) hit the shore at dusk, sweeping dead bodies and wreaking havoc on everything in its path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still engaging in their activities on the beach and didn’t leave immediately and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Protection Agency (BNPB), said in a statement in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come by itself, it dragged cars, wood, houses, swept through everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed through open waters at 800 kph (497 mph) before making landfall on the coast.
Some people climb trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show buildings and shops being destroyed, bridges breaking and collapsing and a mosque being submerged in the water.
The aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes have been observed in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s powerful earthquake was about 200 times more than the energy of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, according to the announcement.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, with an additional 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could not be stopped along the 300 km (190 mi) north coast of Palu, an area called Donggala, which was closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The media was "totally paralyzed with no news" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but the tragedy can become much more horrifying,” they said.
The agency on Saturday was widely condemned for failing to report that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the wave had arrived over time the warning was issued.
In a non-specialist video posted on social media, it is possible to hear a man standing on high screaming panic for people in the street about the approaching tsunami.
A few minutes later, a wall of water flooded the shore, sweeping buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that caused a communication rupture around Palu that made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military had begun cutting cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but displaced people still desperately needed food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian tsunami increased by more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees were staying in tarpaulins set up in office courtyards, they went through devastating scenes on the road, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even as aid groups began significant moves at the start of disaster relief tools, some complained that highly specialized foreign aid workers were prevented from moving to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only begin if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government decides, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ then we can be ready with international assistance but there is no statement yet.”
As Monday night falls on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be the magic that will piece together the murky stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy is pulled up from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia’s national paragliding coach, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“As a veteran in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after news of the Roa Roa hotel’s collapse spread in the paragliding community, he desperately texted WhatsApp to rivals in Palu who were attending the beach festival.
However, his message indicates a gray area instead of two green ones.
“I think that means the messages were not sent,” he said.
The robbers took away $26,750 when the ATM was recharged at Newport in Levee.
According to reports from the Newport Police Department, the robbers took $26,750 from a Brink bank employee when they were depositing money into an ATM in Newport in Levee.
The driver in the car cleared the ATM in the entertainment area and prepared to hand over more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy reported in the article.
As he was busy, a man "came from behind the Brink employee" and took away the bag of money that had to be delivered.
Eyewitnesses reportedly saw several suspects around the scene, but police have yet to identify the number of people involved in the case.
Anyone with information on the identity of the suspect involved should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He wrote in a statement on Twitter on Saturday: “Before, everyone knew me was Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the name as the eighth album name to be released in June.
The change took place before he appeared on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He was the guest on Ariana Grande's behalf when she reported her "emotional disorder", the show's creator said.
As well as the abbreviation in his current stage name, West had previously said the word was religious to him.
“I believe that ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and in the Bible the word means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, while talking about the title of his album with broadcaster Big Boy.
“So I’m a friend, I’m us, I’m us.
The transition away from Kanye, which means only, to Ye - the reflection of the good, the bad, the anxious, everything.
The album is more than our own reflection.
He is one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is widely known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he was aiming for Love and Brother Love.
An artist who worked with West, JAY-Z, was also wondering whether or not there were dashes and capital letters.
Mexico's president says he will not send troops against civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "never bring troops to oppress the Mexican people."
The army opened fire during a peaceful protest in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at the time as left-wing student movements were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has been sworn in to support Mexican youths by granting monthly grants to learners and opening more public universities for free.
He shared that the problem of unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities have led young people to get involved in evils.
The U.S. should double its A.I. aid.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its research spending in the field, said AI investor Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Opinions came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even while the U.S. overall lacked formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: to become a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Double the AI research budget will be a positive start, as all the other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the chance that the next massive AI achievement will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book “Artificial Intelligence Superpower: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked at an AI system that beat Othello players in the U.S. with the highest ranking, after which he was chief executive officer at Microsoft Research and director of the Google branch in China.
Lee approaches previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Advanced Project Research Agency’s Robot Challenge and is interested in when the next competition will take place, to help determine the next vision.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government aid, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s calling for all the leading scholars; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired bright stars from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee shares changes in immigration policy that could also help the U.S. consolidate its AI efforts.
He added: “I think green cards should be automatically issued to PhDs on AI.”
China’s State Council issued its next-generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee added: “China’s National Science Foundation provides aid to people of academic institutions similar to the way the Foundation and other government institutions subsidize U.S. researchers, but the quality of research in China is lower.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at interfering with partners from industry and education, and the White House announced the establishment of the Artificial Intelligence Select Committee.
This month the Defense Advanced Research Projects Steering Agency announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
At the National Science Foundation, they currently invest more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law has sought to set up a National Security Council on Artificial Intelligence but has not seen a move in months.
Macedonian people vote in referendum to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a decades-long dispute settlement with Greece aimed at preventing accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbor corresponds to its own territory and has vetoed NATO and EU membership.
The two governments signed an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents said the change would undermine the national identity of most of Macedonia's Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether voters would meet at least 50 percent of the demands for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot reads: "Do you agree to become a member of NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the deal with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said it was a price to pay to pursue joining institutions such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, of Skopje, said: "Today I am here to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can freely enjoy the patronage of the European Union because it leads to a safer life for all of us."
While members of parliament are not legally bound, they have said they will comply with the results of the vote to make a decision.
The name change will require two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in last year’s parliamentary elections when 66 percent of voters registered to vote.
Voter Gjose Tanevski, 62, in Skopje, said: “I went to vote for my children, because our position is in Europe.”
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which would pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small platform and pulling a chair in front of a tent erected by people who would boycott the referendum.
Kavadarkov said: “We support NATO and the EU, but we want to get involved in the main way, not through the back door.”
“We are a poor country, but we are poor.
If they don’t see us as Macedonia, then we can move to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian link.”
Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe the majority will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said a “no-deal” outcome would be “an affirmation of our future.”
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said about 30 to 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - lower than the required vote.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, said 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they gave the vote in favor.
A successful referendum must have a vote of 50 percent and a vote.
The failure of the referendum showed the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took place in May last year.
Sergio Aguero at Manchester City has breached the entire Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling smashed the Brighton defence with Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian forward received a pass from the middle of the field when he started to lead the ball.
He raced ahead of the three Brighton defenders before breaking into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four blue-shirt players.
He raced up a defender before standing in the way of other opponents at the edge of Brighton.
The pass to the left leads the ball right to Sterling.
The Englishman led his first touch in the penalty area for Aguero, who struck his right shoe with a shot to take down Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan from the right side of the net.
Pep Guardiola told reporters: "Aguero suffered some leg injuries."
“We talked about just letting him play for 55, 60 minutes.
It happened.
We were very lucky that he scored at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the first advantage to the Blues in the Premier League match.”
Scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's field during the match.
He took a pole ball to the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane with a few assists before leading Sterling to the goal.
The Blues striker put the ball in the net just before the ball slipped out of control.
The match between City and Hoffenheim in the Champions League took place at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to burn himself up against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the final round of the tournament, there was not much reason to start over.
But a belligerent Scherzer hopes to win the pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but this only makes sense when there is a round of competition for the Rockies, who lead a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least one spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure the top spot.
“While it’s pointless to play, at least we get to throw the ball when we learn about the atmosphere in Denver along with the crowd and other teams that will play with whatever form I can play this year.
Why don't I want to play in a game like that?
The Nationals have yet to announce the opening player in Sunday's game, but it looks like Scherzer will be sent the ball in this situation.
Scherzer, who kicked off his 34th starter, will have practice on Thursday and play on his Sunday break.
Washington's right-hand man has a record of 18-7 with 2.53 ERAs and 300 attacks in 220 two-thirds of matches this season.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The president mentioned the details of the situation around his Supreme Court, picking Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of voting for Republicans in the midterm elections.
“Everything we do has potential in November.
There are only five weeks left until one of the most important elections in life.
This is one of the big, big things — not running, but having an executive is the reason I go around fighting for bright candidates.”
Trump continued, “You will see the radical negative, negative Democrats exist right now.
And they are determined to suppress their power by using any means, and you will see selfishness and trickery.
They don’t care who’s hurt, they have to step over who to gain power and control, they just want power and control, and we’re not going to give them that.”
He added, "Democrats are trying to 'restrict and obstruct'.
"You've seen it in the last four days," he added, adding that the Democratic Party was "angry and selfish and cunning and hypocritical."
He pointed out the Senate Judiciary Committee’s designation of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which was met with booing from below.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you reveal the information?
What's up?
No, no, no, I expected – it was a body language that wasn’t excellent – but rather the least body language I’ve ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer an open party.
Giving an opinion is unacceptable.
I’m not surprised that the activists of Momentum, in my local party, voted to censor me.
After all, I’m the latest in a series of Labour MPs to be told that I’m not welcome — for speaking up.
Also a member of Congress with me, Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she was adamant in her support of oppositionism.
In my case, the censorship was directed at me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a grand economic policy, on national security, in Europe, similar ironic issues that Jeremy disagreed with earlier leaders.
Informing the Nottingham East Labor Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For nearly eight years as a member of the local Labour Party, Friday night leadership meetings took place in this manner.
Sadly, today, it’s not the tone in many meetings and the promise of “kinder, more gentle” politics has long been forgotten and really whether that ever began.”
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged on whether the party’s leaders accept it or not.
This started soon after Jeremy became the leader, as my former colleagues thought that my political views had begun to expect me to shift my mind and take on positions that I would never approve of – whether on national security or EU market direction.
Whenever I speak publicly — and really whatever I say — entails abuse on social media that calls for removal, accuses the central politics, tells me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me seeing that.
Indeed, I knew I was more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments pointed at me were political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face the flow of sexual or racist abuse every day but never shy away.
One of the saddest aspects of this political age is that the level of abuse has become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour Party should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer that open party and with every move of “unconfidence” or change of rules of choice, the Party has become narrowed down.
I’ve had a lot of advice over the past two years about urging me to stay calm, not too many words, and then I’m going to “take it easy.”
But I’m not in politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was just a boy, I was motivated by the neglect of Thatcher’s government, which literally brought down my comprehensive school, I have sought to bring better public services to those who need them most – whether local commissioners or government ministers.
I have never tried to hide my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be wrong about my policy positions and my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the move on Friday, all I want to share is that as the country lags in Brexit, hurting our households, businesses and public services, I have no desire to waste my time and energy on loyalty to the Labour Party leadership.
But really, a message outside of Nottingham Momentum that I’m on my wing, addressed to my constituents, whether I’m a member of the Labour Party or not: I’m proud to serve and I promise that there will be no threat of elimination or any political means preventing me from acting for what I believe is in the greatest benefit to my relatives.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Ayr Unbeatable Lead
The latter two attempts may have skewed the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win the Tennent Premiership match of the day.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only king of the ten teams.
After all, it’s also their superior defense, as well as many better chances for them, bearing the title of host and coach Peter Murchie absolutely have the right to be satisfied.
He said: “So far, we’ve been through our games and we’re still unbeaten, so I’m satisfied.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said: “Receive for Ayr, they seize opportunities better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute goal, scored by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but, a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, opened the game for the Warriors, allowing Melrose to show off his skill and Jason Baggot set a goal.
Climo rose ahead of Ayr with a penalty, before, in the first half, he scored then scored further points with a solo shot that raised the score to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose began the second half favorably and Patrick Anderson scored, Baggot added, shortening the score to five.
After a long injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was lagging behind, and since the restart, Ayr has been ahead of the curve thanks to Stafford McDowall's feat, Climo added points.
Acting captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card, and again, Melrose made the sidekick with a goal without Bruce Colvine's extra score, in the face of a tense pressure.
However, the home team was back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for facing Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson scored on the Ayr team's support advantage.
Climo scored more points, as he had done almost since his return, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's shot and passed it to winger Gregor Henry after the hosts' fifth score.
Still Game star ready to enter restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kieran is about to move into the hospitality industry after learning he is considered the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star played Jack Jarvis in the BBC film, which he wrote and played in Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last on the radio, it looks like Kiernan is planning Craiglang’s next life.
According to the official list listed, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the matter, but a source from Scottish Sun said Kiernan was looking forward to embarking on a "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
'The coast is ours': Bolivian state not bordering Bolivia hopes the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval headquarters equipped in La Paz.
All public buildings have blue flags.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon were painted with the slogan: "The sea is our right.
“The sea is our task.”
Every corner of Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile during the bloody resource conflict of the 19th century is still alive – as is the desire to sail to the Pacific again.
Those hopes are perhaps the most burning in decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court of justice ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, said: “Bolivia is motivated, united and calm, and of course expected in a positive view of the outcome.”
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ’s ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will back Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of tense exchanges – Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign sea passage.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s convincing principal president, who faces a fierce debate to re-election next year — also has more cards in Monday’s ruling.
At the end of August, he insisted: “We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean.”
But some analysts argue that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia – and this is less likely to change.
The Netherlands-based UN has no right to return territory to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of potential exchanges.
The ICJ’s ruling comes just six months after the final debates showed the situation was “not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And beyond Bolivia’s litigation, the last four years could be reversed.
Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said: “The issue of sea access has been attacked by the current Bolivian authorities.”
She added that Morales’ belligerent statements had cut off all of Chile’s remaining goodwill.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate with each other, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, Bolivia’s representative to The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court’s decision-making was unusually quick.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to end 139 years of mutual interest disagreements.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most famous presidents in Latin America – was using the maritime issue as a political lifeline.
Bolivia added: "Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific."
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to move past the past.”
North Korea says there will never be a nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has revealed that his country will never denuclearize unless it can trust Washington before.
Ri spoke Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill its promises during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two sides.
He made the remarks as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be preparing to restart nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a “fake dream” to continue sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean War to make North Korea succumb.
Washington is cautiously agreeing to the statement without Pyongyang making notable moves to disarm first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are looking forward to a second summit.
But there is little doubt that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country could see as the only way to ensure safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion launches latest line of wide-brimmed hats that are about to cover all the major streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or stay away from the sun completely, you don’t have to look far.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne reveal a range of other top-of-the-line designs in their SS19 collection on the runway that will shock the design style at Paris Fashion Week.
Non-applying hats swept Instagram this summer, and the designers brought their eye-catching creations to the runway.
Valentino’s signature item was a beige hat that was too topless with wide-brimmed heads attached to feather-like accessories, covering the model’s head.
Other oversized accessories include giraffe watermelon, witch hat and even a pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks are hand stitched in the same style as Hannibal Lecter rather than high-end fashion.
One design is like a diving device complete with a snorkel and goggles, and another looks like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you keep catching in the direction of the giant fashion - then you're in luck.
The melodrama predicts that large-sized earbuds may be about to be covered all over the big streets near you.
The large-sized hats became hot on the heels of ‘La Bomba’, the rim-wide hat used by Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The adoring label behind the ultra-impractical hat unleashed across social media has brought another big creation onto the runway – a beach bag that’s nearly as big as a bathing suit.
The fire-colored raffia bag, bordered with a raffia thread with a white leather handle, was featured in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famed stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large-sized seawear and bags flooding the big streets next summer – as the designer has made a huge impact that it’s hard to ignore the need for large-sized accessories.”
John Edward: Foreign language skills are essential for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland maintain their academic excellence, the event continued in 2018 with a string of commendable academic results, underpinned by both individual and collective sports, arts, music and community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, sponsored by the Scottish Council for Private Schools (SCIS), are working to deliver the best quality of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to equip students with deep and broad knowledge, as well as career orientation and student status as global citizens.
As an education sub-discipline that can design and run the school’s distinctive curriculum, we see modern foreign languages continue to be a popular and chosen topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, what you say goes into his mind.
If you talk to him in his own language, what he says goes into his feelings.”
This is a compelling message that we don’t rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From recent exams this year, we can see that foreign languages are leading the rankings with the best passing scores in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language students scored higher than grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools shows that 72 percent of students score more than A in Chinese, while 72 percent learn German, 69 percent learn French, and 63 percent learn Spanish also score A.
This suggests that private schools in Scotland are moving in the direction of seeing foreign languages as essential skills that children and adolescents will not be able to afford in the future.
Elective foreign language subjects are being taken seriously as major STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private school programs as well as elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the British Skills and Profession Council in 2014 found that among the reasons employers have difficulty finding people, there is a shortage of foreign language skills.
As a result, foreign language skills are becoming more and more practical in order to equip young people for future professional practice.
With more and more career prospects needing a foreign language, these skills become practical in an increasingly flat world.
No matter how people choose to work, if they learn a second language, they will gain a real advantage in the future when they have such a lifetime skill.
Being able to communicate directly in the native language, a multilingual person will obviously lead every challenge.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to practice a simple passage in another foreign language, and only French was the only foreign language with a percentage of a unit number, 15 percent.
That’s why investing in foreign language teaching is essential for today’s children.
Holding in the hands of multiple languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a brighter potential to find a real job.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
Some schools will focus on more modern languages, while others will teach foreign languages that are considered important to the UK in view of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there are also a variety of foreign languages to choose from within private schools, along with a team of teachers with expertise in the profession.
Private schools in Scotland focus on providing an academic environment that prepares and equips children with skills essential to success, no matter what the future may be.
It cannot be denied that, in an international business environment, foreign languages will continue to be extremely important factors for the future of the nation, which should be replicated in education.
In fact, modern foreign languages should be rated as “international communication skills.”
Private schools will continue to offer this opportunity to Scottish youth: diverse and exceptional.
There can be no other choice.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron made his debut at the Lakers in Sunday's Battle of San Diego.
The wait is coming to an end for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers manager Luke Walton has announced that James will play in a pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But how long you will be in the game is not yet determined.
Walton told the Lakers website: “It’s going to be in less than 48 minutes.”
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said there was a possibility James would join the game for a limited time.
Following the week’s training, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games at the Lakers.
He said: “I don’t need to play a few pre-season warm-ups at this stage of my career anymore.
Trump campaign in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight, in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump begins his campaign.
This is the first stop in President Trump’s five campaign journey next week, including a stop in pro-state states like Tennessee and Mississippi.
The vote in favour of his nominee for the vacant seat of the Supreme Court is on hold, with President Trump trying to enlist support ahead of the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote begins in November.
Trump’s campaign in West Virginia starts at what time of night and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling City, West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7pm Eastern Time, Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s campaign in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump will likely mention this week’s hearing by Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s nominee, who is currently facing sexual assault charges and the Senate’s vote of approval had to be moved back a week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
However, the main purpose of these mass rallies was to enlist the support of Republican candidates ahead of the November election.
As a result, the campaign goal through five rallies next week aims to “strengthen the volunteers and supporters of the Republican Party in the race to protect and expand the majority of votes they hold in the Senate and House.”
“Control of Congress is an important issue on the agenda, so the president will visit as many states as possible before entering the busy election season,” a Trump campaign spokesman said.
Expected to take place in Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, the rally tonight could draw supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, while also attracting Pittsburgh media coverage,” West Virginia Metro News said in a statement.
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit in the past month to West Virginia, the state he won by 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to support Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for West Virginia State Senator, as he is now behind in the polls.
Simon Haeder, a political science researcher at the University of West Virginia, said: “The president’s visit to the state to enlist support in the candidate’s vote is not a good sign for Morrisey.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team shows determination to fight to keep the trophy in singles matches on Sunday
After three unbalanced matches, Saturday afternoon doubles may be essential for the Ryder Cup.
A pendulum-style wrist swing for momentum is an entirely new sporting concept, but also a movement that athletes really believe in, especially in matches like this one.
So where is the current momentum?
“They were six points ahead, flying now only four, and I think that’s the motivation for us,” says Jordan Spieth as he strolls around.
Of course, the European team has an advantage, four points ahead, and they have 12 more games left.
As Spieth said, the U.S. team is still a bit hopeful and they are very much encouraged, especially with the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas. These two players have played many times and each has spent three points.
Spieth is a veteran golfer who plays the ball from the spot to the hole and he always leads as an example.
The shouts of joy grew louder when he arrived at his round, especially the stroke of the ball to equalize the match as he and Thomas took turns hitting the ball into the hole.
The 15th win was the same, meaning he had full confidence in the American team’s comeback.
Spieth said: “You have to think hard and worry about your own game.”
All the athletes left.
There are 18 holes left to score.
For the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an indisputable legend of the Ryder Cup, have been the only couple to score higher than Spieth and Thomas.
This odd but respectable couple of the European team has won 4:0 and can’t make a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only match that did not hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and nine holes later on Friday morning.
That victory and the energy from them spread to the cheering crowd giving people the feeling that the two of them were the ones they needed to beat on Sunday; and there was no more deserving player than Fleetwood or Molinari to defend the European team’s victory at sunset on Le Golf National.
Hopefully both of you will be in different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to confirm the European team’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourball series in the morning, while playing alongside Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles at the first nine holes completely lost the chance of a counterattack.
On Sundays, no one was able to pull them out of that failure.
Fourball and foursome matches are always worth watching because of the interaction between the duos, their advice and the observation that the strategy of play changes in a matter of seconds.
The European team played better and took the lead quite far ahead of the final day, but this foursome series showed that the U.S. team still had a chance to win.
The European team leads 10-6 before the start of the last day of the Ryder Cup
The European team will take advantage before the final day of the Ryder Cup after a spectacular fourball and foursome series, ahead of the US team 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led this advantage by winning two Tiger Woods games to win four more points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn of the European side, determined to win back the cup to lose to his team in Hazeltine two years ago, overpowered the U.S. side in the morning fourball match, leading 3-1.
The U.S. team played better in the foursome series, winning two games, but failed to win the final.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points in Sunday’s singles series to win the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European player to win four points in a row when he and Molinari, commonly known as the "Molliwood" couple, were the second couple after the dramatic weekend that won four points in their opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a fourball match, they had a more convincing win over Woods and U.S. rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a score of 5&4.
Woods played two games on Saturday and sometimes had flashes of light, but so far, he has lost 19 of 29 games in the fourball and foursome series, including seven in a row.
Justin Rose, after taking a break in the morning fourball series, returned with Henrik Stenson in a foursome match, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, two of the world's first and third-placed golfers, with a 2&1 score.
However, despite the pleasant southwest Paris weather, the European team did not have an easy day to play.
The Gunners have won three times, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a milestone for the U.S. team with two points on Saturday.
They won a convincing 2&1 win over the Spanish player, Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a fourball match, and then went on to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a 4&3 score in a foursome match, despite missing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only twice a team led by four points can start singles matches, although the Furyk team can only hold the cup.
After only being considered second in two days, Sunday will most likely become a back-up for the team.
North Korea says 'no way' unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that sanctions are still being maintained deepening its suspicion of the United States and in this situation, there is no way it will unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho, speaking at the UN General Assembly’s annual meeting, said North Korea had taken “multiple measures of goodwill” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test bases and committing to nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we don’t see the same move from the U.S. side,” he said.
“If we can’t trust the U.S. side, then we won’t be able to confidently secure our national security, and in such a situation, there’s no way we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri repeated North Korea’s familiar complaint that Washington refused to denuclearize “stage by stage” and that North Korea would receive the corresponding benefit of taking steps, his remarks have a notable point of not rejecting unilateral nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang had previously refused.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which he pledged to work towards “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump promised to ensure North Korea’s security.
North Korea is still trying to find a way to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States insists that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington is also opposed to calls for an easing of harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘first nuclear disarmament’ and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goals in a coercive manner, even protesting the ‘declaration of an end to war’,” Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is just a wild dream for those who don’t understand us.
But the problem here is that the sanctions that remain in place continue to lose our trust.”
Ri made no mention of plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. leader presented at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the foreign minister referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the negotiating party on the issue of nuclear disarmament is South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not fall into the current deadlock.”
Ri’s tone, however, was different from last year’s, when he told the General Assembly that North Korea’s launch of missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable on a suicide mission after Trump called Kim “the Rocket Man.”
Last year at the United Nations, Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, but this year praised Kim for taking bold steps to disarm, but Trump also stressed that much more needs to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t set a deadline for this: “Two years, three years or just five months doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its efforts.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council sanctions must continue to be vigorously and uncompromisingly enforced until we can confirm the results of complete, final denuclearization with verifiable evidence.”
The Security Council has agreed to step up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo held talks with Ri on the sidelines of official U.N. General Assembly meetings and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the results of the last visit are not very promising.
He left Pyongyang after a visit in July and said the talks had been progressing, but just hours later North Korea accused the foreign minister of making “the same demands as the gangster society.”
North Korea pledged to join a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-In this month to dismantle a missile test base and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “similar steps.”
He said Kim directed that the “similar move” he was seeking was the security assurance Trump had pledged during talks in Singapore and moved toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on full rest
In an effort to combat the machine-pressure learning culture, with 'night owl students' drinking coffee instead of water, a new course at Harvard University this year has encouraged all college students to sleep more.
Students studying at the world’s number one university often don’t know the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and an expert at Women’s Hospital, and Brigham, who designed the course, believes it to be the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for starting this course came after he attended a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on the learning process.
“After the end of the talk, a female student came up to me and said, ‘Why did you know this in the last year?’
She said no one told her about the importance of sleep, which really surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced for the first time this year, explains to students how the importance of good sleep habits enhances academic and athletic performance, while improving their overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s chief executive of health services, said the school decided to introduce the course after finding students with severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course covers a wide range of interactive tasks.
In a section featuring a dormitory room image, students can click on coffee mugs, curtains, workout machines and books to learn about how caffeine, light and sleep deprivation affect their performance, as well as the importance of forming a bedtime routine on time.
In another section, participants were asked how long-term sleep deprivation could increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, the university campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that this course cannot immediately change students’ behavior.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the health impact of choosing to smoke,” Czeisler added.
He said that the culture that prides itself on “night owl students” still exists, while modern technologies and growing pressure on students to lead to sleep deprivation is an increasingly serious problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep, good sleep quality should become a student’s ‘secret weapon’ to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety – even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to fall into a state of hunger, leading us to constantly starve.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California who was studying biology, chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, and he also took one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course helped him ‘open his eyes’ and inspired him to make an effort to organize a course within the whole school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduates to take a similar program of study before starting to compete in the main course.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students take into consideration when setting bedtime, waking hours, and being aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ emitted by electronic displays and LEDs, which can cause circadian arrhythmia, resulting in difficulty sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes down Gerrard's boys
Rangers had an unsuccessful day as Dolly Menga's counter-attack resulted in Steven Gerrard's side losing 1-0 to Livingston.
The Ibrox team hopes to mark their first win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as head coach, extending the eight-point gap from Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga remained on the offensive for seven minutes before the end of the first half, but Rangers' temperament seemed never to be crushed.
Rangers have now fallen to 6th place, while Livingston has climbed to 3rd place, and only behind Hibernian in goal difference.
And Rangers also had to deal with another problem after border referee Calum Spence had to treat the head wound after a clear object was thrown from the top of the away field.
Gerrard has changed the squad eight times compared to the team that has overtaken Ayr to enter the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt retains that Livi 11 drew and won a point against the Hearts team last week, and he must have been thrilled with the way his students besieged the opponent in each attack.
Although the Rangers hold the ball more, Livingston is the team that is really dangerous when there is the ball.
They should have scored just two minutes after Menga first threw Scott Pittman on the pitch, attacking Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
A deep shot by Keaghan Jacobs brought the ball to captain Craig Halkett's feet, but defender Alan Lithgow was only able to bring the ball to the back column.
Rangers take control of the ball on the pitch, but their play is based mostly on more hope than trust, especially in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos is certain that he must get the penalty on the penalty spot because he and Steven Lawless had a collision but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian’s appeal.
The Rangers only scored twice in the first half, but former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly barely had any trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's counterattack.
Although Livi’s opening in the 34th minute was seen as an advantage, no one could deny that their victory was absolutely worth it.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to handle Jacobs' deep-field throw.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher poked Scott Robinson at the ball, and Scott calmly chose Menga to make the simple finish.
Gerrard immediately took a break, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and replacing him almost immediately made an impact when the winger poked the ball at Morelos, but Kelly was impressed when he immediately blocked the ball.
But Livingston succeeded in wooing the away team to play the way they wanted, as Lithgow and Halkett repeatedly launched long passes.
Holt's side had a chance to rise to the lead in the last minutes of the game, but unfortunately McGregor chose the right position to stop Jacobs before Lithgow hit wide heads from the corner.
Rangers' new player Glenn Middleton went on to claim a penalty after a collision with Jacobs, but was once again dismissed by referee Thomson.
Yearbook: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
Quoting a page from the Yearbook "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and INTRODUCTION ... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, inventing the foundation for a device called the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geiger Counter has not only become the scientific pillar, but also the pillar of popular culture. The following example is a dialogue in the film "Bells of Coronado", which premiered in 1950, starring the scientist and cowboy king Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man: "What is this?"
Rogers: “This is the Geiger Counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, the sentence can actually hear the effects of radioactive atoms in the mineral.”
Evans: “Yeah, there’s a buzz here!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name still remains with time.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach the Immune System How to ‘Watch’ Broken Cells
New Cancer Vaccines Can Teach the Immune System How to ‘Watch’ Broken Cells and Kill Them
Vaccines teach the immune system how to recognize damaged cells during treatment
This method includes taking immune cells from patients, changing cells in the laboratory
These cells can then ‘see’ the protein common in many cancers and are re-injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is showing positive results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with a vaccine teaches her immune system to recognize broken cells and her ovarian cancer cells disappear after more than 18 months.
This method involves taking immune cells from patients, changing cells in the lab, so that these cells can "see" the protein common in many cancers, called HER2, which is then injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine in our hands.
HER2 “promotes the development of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of study, which takes immune cells from the patient’s body and “teachs” them how to target cancer cells, once worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye receives many "rock bricks" showing his frenzied support for Trump, wearing MAGA (Make America Great Again) hats after Saturday Live Music Night (SNL)
It's not going well.
Kanye West got a lot of boobs in the studio during the SNL concert, after his barbaric performance. During the performance, he praised US President Donald Trump and vowed to run in 2020.
After performing his third song, Ghost Town, still wearing the Make America Great Again hat, he angrily expressed his opposition to the Democratic Party and pledged his support for Trump.
“A lot of times I talk to white friends, they say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
If I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a minor work starring Matt Damon. In the series, this Hollywood star ironically took Brett Kavanaugh's oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the show was not broadcast, the footage of West’s angry speech was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s unclear whether Rock intentionally ridiculed West for posting this.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was uncomfortable behind the wings of the chicken because of his hat.
“They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go on a show with that hat.'
They bullied me!
Then they told me I was bogged down," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you know what it's like to get bogged down?", he insisted that he would "wear my hero's iconic hat, because no one can force me to do anything. If you want the world to move forward?
Please love.”
Variety reported that his speech caused the crowd to shout at least twice, while SNL members were puzzled, one person said: "The whole studio is silent."
West was chosen to replace Ariana Grande, because of her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, who died a few days ago.
West confused many people with the performance of I Love It, dressed like a Chai Perrier.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner. He once posted on Twitter: "For one of the bravest souls: WHAT YOU HAVE SAYED IN THE PRINCIPLES."
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “just acting out of his nature, and that’s really cool.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying a music product or a costume, or advocating his ‘art’) because I believe that person is pursuing and propagating an ideology that is not good for my community.
He has the right to freedom.
We too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, officially "named Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, but only followed Diddy's path, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly known as Snoop Lion; or the late Prince music legend, also changed his name to an icon and later, changed his name to another artist, Prince.
Charged with murder in stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear in court at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Prosecutor’s Office.
Star Movie Game Wang's Anger Criticizes Toxic Maleness
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy television series, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor is quite angry with the hero and mentions that such on-screen male characters will make young men feel like they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something is wrong here” and raised the question of how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, 31. He admitted he felt ‘quite necessary’ to solve this problem.
“At this point, I personally feel like I don’t know what we’ve done wrong with so-called masculinity?” he shared.
“What have we taught men as adults about the problems that are ahead of us?”
Kit believes that television may also be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity of the extremely masculine characters they build.
He continued: ‘What are the traits that are innate and which are due to education?
What is being taught on TV and on the street that makes boys feel like they have to be male?
I think this is really a dilemma of this age – how do we change?
Because obviously there was something wrong with our young boys.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any more prequel or extraquel to Game of Thrones, after the series ended next summer, adding that he was “bored of the battlefield and the code.”
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's remake of True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing when he decided to stop playing Game of Thrones.
“I’ve met my wife in this series, which is where starting for my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose plays Ygritte, the lover of the Jon Snow character that Kit played in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018, on the Leslie family residence in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new infections
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and Aids has increased by 14 percent.
Health officials say the country has more than 820,000 people with the disease.
In Q2 2018 alone, the number of new cases recorded was 40,000.
The vast majority of new infections are caused by sexually transmitted infections. This is a major change from the previous one.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV along this route has fallen to almost zero. This is the speech of Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and Aids in China each year has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV infection is a serious problem that is taking place in the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality has not been considered illegal in China since 1997, in fact, discrimination against the LGBT community is still very common.
Due to the country’s conservative traditional values, the study estimated that 70-90% of men eventually married, despite having developed sexual relations with men.
Many people are infected with a century-old disease due to insufficient use of protective measures during same-sex sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to providing HIV medicines to all infected patients in response to the disease.
Maxine Waters denied her staff exposed Republican senators' data, stressing 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
On Saturday, U.S. Democratic Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican senators on Wikipedia about lawmakers.
Democrats in Los Angeles insist that the complaints were orchestrated by far-right experts and websites.
“False, lies and lies are even more despicable,” Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
According to the report, the leak includes the address and phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, from Utah.
The information began appearing online Thursday, after an unidentified person at Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against a candidate for the office of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was revealed shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifies the source of posts related to Waters’ office and discloses information about one of Waters’ employees.
Waters went on to say, “This baseless allegation is completely untrue and absolutely a lie.”
“The staff in my office have been compromised by identity, personal information and safety due to these false and misleading allegations, and it is impossible for anyone to disclose such information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely untrue and absolutely a lie.”
Waters’s statement immediately drew criticism online, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This rejection statement expresses anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This shows that she has no temperament to become a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of a behavior that is not done by them, one should not be angry.
They are not challenged.
They were not asked about the motives of the person making the allegations.
They must show calmness and sanity.”
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' response to Judge Kavanaugh's response to Democratic critics and critics also accused him of being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican running for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
“Big if true,” he wrote on Twitter.
Waters stated that her office had warned “the authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false allegations.
“We will make sure the perpetrators are brought to light,” she continued, “and they will be held accountable for all actions that could be harmful and dangerous to any of my staff.”
Johnny English Review - Rowan Atkinson's funny useless spy
Now, it is possible to notice a fairly traditional trend in any new film whose British element is the search for the meaning of Brexit. And the next episode of the Johnny English spy-action comedy-action series is no exception. The series premiered in 2003, with the name Johnny English and part 2 titled Johnny English - Re-release, which premiered in 2011.
Will self-reflection on how useless we are to ourselves become a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, Johnny English’s limited ability with rounded eyes and flexible facial muscles is allowed to shuffle things up again – his name simply represents a comic book work designed for non-English speaking areas.
Of course, he was a secret agent, although he always feigned odd ducks in the style of Inspector Clouseau, mixing Mr Bean’s humor and a bit of something to contribute to the Chariots of Fire theme tune during the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
The character’s prototype also relies on the international traveler and mysterious man Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard TV commercial that has now sunk into oblivion and caused chaos upon waking up.
There are some interesting scenes in the latest Johnny English episode.
I liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter while wearing medieval armor and propellers banging on his hat.
While Atkinson’s humor is fully expressed, the humor element here doesn’t seem to be enough weight and a bit redundant, especially when “serious” movie franchises like the 007 series and Impossible Missions make comedy just a spice.
The humor in this film can only make children laugh, and I consider Johnny English’s silly mistakes to be nothing as creative and remarkable as the jokes in Atkinson’s Mr. Bean silent film.
The situation that leads the story is that England is in serious trouble.
Hackers have infiltrated the network of British super-secret agents, revealing the identities of all British agents operating outside, resulting in the dismay of a spy on a mission, a very unfortunate minor role played by Kevin Eldon.
This was the prime minister’s last chance choice, a proud and powerful figure, now facing this khanic political crisis: Emma Thompson was very good at portraying this version of Prime Minister Teresa May, but under the scenario she didn’t have much ground to play.
Intelligence advisers reported that the identities of all active agents had been exposed and that she would have to mobilize a retired spy.
And that person was a clumsy Johnny English who was teaching in a rural area, but in fact was teaching off-program lessons to become a secret agent: there were some pretty interesting jokes here, because English taught students to be spies in the rock music academy style.
English was summoned back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with the poor former assistant Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, asking for a glamorous female submarine commander. Vicki Pepperdine takes on the role of a bit of a waste of this talent.
So the Batman and Robin duo who trouble the Queen's Order return to duty and meet Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful spy Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger under the curse of the glamorous tech billionaire after claiming he can solve every British computer headache problem: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventure with unimaginable antics: after camouflaged as waiters, they burn a French restaurant in the blink of an eye; cause chaos on Volta’s luxury yacht; and English further confuses when trying to use virtual reality headsets to probe Volta’s home.
At the end of the film, the knots will definitely be removed, but such excitement is quite similar to the TV channels for children.
It's a pretty ordinary piece.
And like other Johnny English films, I can’t help but ask: can’t the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a fair role, worthy of his talent?
Labour denies that it is working on a plan to allow British citizens to work for four days but receive a five-day salary
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider a radical plan that will allow British people to work four days a week but receive a five-day pay.
According to the information received, the party wants business owners to transfer the savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
This means that employees get a three-day weekend off but still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea "fits" the party's economic agenda and is expected to increase support for its workers.
The UK Trade Union Congress has confirmed the move to work four days a week as a way for workers to enjoy the benefits of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “The review of policies is expected to be announced later this year.
“This goal cannot be achieved in the short term, but working four days a week is an aspiration in line with the party’s policy of rebalancing the economy in favor of workers as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse the idea. The UK Green Party committed to working four days a week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, this idea has not been adopted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week policy is not party policy and the party does not currently consider this policy."
Shadow Prime Minister John McDonnell took advantage of the Labor conference last week to strengthen his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "anonymous directors" and "victors" at utility companies.
These plans of the dark prime minister also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not be able to get their full stake back because the Labour Party’s government can apply ‘deductibles’ based on behavior deemed to be wrong.
He also confirmed plans for employees to join the company’s board of directors and set up a Comprehensive Ownership Fund to hand 10 percent of the private company’s equity to its employees, from which they are likely to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy on “60 Minutes” about whether the results of the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh made them change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote to appoint him as Supreme Court Justice for at least a week and raised questions about whether the Federal Intelligence Agency’s findings could prompt any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" program reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI had found any evidence that could have caused the senators to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I suppose of course,” Kennedy said.
“I spoke during the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, i.e. after the accusation was made and asked, 'Did you do that?'
He responded decisively, decisively and decisively.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to have been absolutely certain.
He said: “I have already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and there is only one very powerful charge that will change me.”
“Professor Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett denied it very strongly,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all the people she told her name couldn’t verify the story.
36 years have passed.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it contribute to the eradication of poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with the participation of an impressive array of stars to carry out an equally impressive mission: to end world poverty.
In the seventh year of the event, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Hunger Reduction Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
To receive a free admission ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or any other meaningful form of help raise awareness of the goal of poverty alleviation.
But how has this Global Citizen Festival achieved its success, when it is now only 12 years away from achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding a free music night for everyone a practical way to persuade people to call for action, or just another form of “keyboard movement” – people feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or submitting a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizenship Organization says there are over 10 million “actions” from noted supporters, promoting a range of different goals.
They say these actions have helped push leaders around the world to make commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set out to implement interventions that improve the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from the group’s actions, with at least $10 billion being disbursed or raised funds.
The group estimates that so far, secured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partner organization consisting of investors and implementers, which is committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” promising to provide $25 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 Twitter posts from the Global Citizens group.
“With support from the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can turn social injustices that lead to undernutrition into a mark in history,” Health Power Program Ambassador Tracey Ullman told an audience during a live performance in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called “Nutrition Power,” which ensures nutritional intervention for 5 million women and children.
Responding to one of the FAQs on the team’s website “what makes you believe we can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizens Group responded: “This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail.
But just like the civil rights movements and the anti-apartheid movement before us, we will succeed because together we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. May Use Navy to ‘Sparkle’ Russia for Energy Exports – Home Secretary
The Washington Examiner quoted U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke as saying that Washington could mobilize the Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleges that Russia’s involvement in Syria — more notably at the invitation of the legitimate government — is just an excuse to explore new energy markets.
According to the report, he said: “I believe the reason they entered the Middle East was because they wanted to trade energy like in Eastern Europe, the southern depression of Europe.”
And according to official news, there are many ways and measures to prevent this.
“The United States has the ability to use the Navy to ensure that the sea-welded transport routes remain open and will close, when necessary, to ensure that their energy sources are not put into the market,” he said.
Zinke has called for event attendees to be organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that claims to be the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that the two were equally effective.
“The economic option that Iran and Russia can choose is to take advantage of and change the type of fuel,” he said, while calling Russia “the one with only one strength” with its economy based on fossil fuels alone.
The statements come as the Trump administration seeks to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia’s position, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the Nord Stream 2 Northern Stream oil project “inappropriate” that, according to Trump, has given Moscow “full control” of Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 Northern Stream 2 oil and gas project, built to double existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s harsh opposition to the project simply stems from economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we have a common view that energy cannot be a tool to pressure and consumers must be given a choice of suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked a backlash from Germany, which later reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Confederation of Industries (BDI), has urged the United States not to interfere in the European Union’s energy policy, as well as bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I face a big problem when there is a third country trying to interfere with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), said after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “seriously consider” running for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running.
“It is time for women to come to Washington and correct government errors, and so need a woman at the top.”
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during a town hall meeting and said he was “taking the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m really worried about what Donald Trump will do to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is outspoken about Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said “of course the FBI must investigate before voting.”
However, a poll on Thursday found that a majority of Warren’s voters did not think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Research, 58 percent of Massachusetts voters said senators should not run for office.
32% voted for her to run for office.
The poll showed more voters supporting former Gov. Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38% voting in favor and 48% voting in opposition.
Other potential Democratic candidates named for the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin Leads to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) of Track Palin at Donald Trump Campaign
Track Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through when he comes back, I can totally relate to other families also suffering from PTSD and the damage that our soldiers carry when they return,” she told a crowd at the Donald Trump campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son's arrest "a clear problem that no one wants to talk about" and said her son and other veterans returned from the war "had changed, were more thorny, and wondered if there was respect for them and their comrades, air forces and every other member of the military for what they had dedicated to this country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing others from reporting domestic violence and possessing weapons while intoxicated.
18 states and D.C. support new refugee policy challenges
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are in favor of challenging the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and D.C. sent a brief collective text Friday in Washington in support of asylum seekers opposed to the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace and Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August in protest of federal policy has not yet been revealed.
She said her lover "and the son of his violent gang members" had abused her but U.S. officials declined her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors from Grace-backed states describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum applicants in the U.S. are when countries face widespread gang and domestic violence issues.
The new U.S. refugee policy runs counter to the 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Council to allow undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy “ignors the state, federal and international legal system that has been in place for decades.”
“Federal law requires the consideration of all asylum applications based on the specific facts and circumstances of the petitioner and this obstruction policy violates that principle,” the short text states.
Prosecutors also argued in the short text that the denial of immigration policy harms the U.S. economy, because immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide adequate labor resources.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered judges to process applications for immigration not to continue allowing asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang abuse in June.
“Only allow asylum to people who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political perspective,” Sessions said in a policy announcement on June 11.
Refugee is never a measure of minimizing all the problems – even all the serious ones – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more dire.
“It’s really stressful,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while patting her son with a fever at an evacuation center in Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings in more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
People return to their destroyed homes, pick up their belongings in the water, and try to salvage whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were completely overcrowded, after damage from a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, had a broken back and shoulder lying outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients treated outdoors due to strong aftershocks continued.
His tears burst as he recalled how a violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We don’t even have time to save ourselves.
I think I was thrown into the rubble of the wall,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had gone to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry and cry for help, but then I heard nothing more.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and children.
I hope they are all safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ad'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily covering the common interests of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. newspapers for propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to an additional China Daily sum to Des Moines Register — Iowa’s best-selling newspaper — after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional election.
Trump’s allegations that Beijing is seeking to interfere in the U.S. election mark a new phase in a campaign to increase pressure on China by Washington, according to what U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war, with evidence that they have imposed high tariffs on their imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China’s tariff policy in retaliation in the early stages of the trade war has been designed to target exporters in Trump’s pro-Republican states such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a long-time former governor of Iowa, which exports large agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, saying China “is continuing that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free newspaper.”
“In an effort to spread propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, at the newsstands on the streets of Beijing, you rarely find dissenting views and will not see any genuine reflection on the various Chinese opinions about China’s difficult economic trajectory, because it is clear that the media is entirely within the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers has shied away from his offer to post", though he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating women voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh's case
As many of the top Republicans stand up to defend the candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh over several sexual assault allegations, analysts warn that they could face backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The feelings surrounding the incident were strong, and most of the Republican candidates on the campaign list indicated they wanted to keep voting.
There are things we can’t do again,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he did not think Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona State) pressed the button to agree the FBI to conduct an investigation enough to appease angry voters.
The Washington, D.C. newspaper quoted Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – tomorrow they will not forget and by November they will not forget.”
Mic reported that on Friday morning, protesters chanting "November is coming!" as they marched on the Senate's corridor because Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee chose to continue voting for Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford.
“Enthusiasm and democracy will be pushed higher than ever,” Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
“It is said that this motivation is now very high; yes.
But it could be even higher, especially among women in the suburbs and young voters, ages 18 to 29, who don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford publicly took the oath of office on details of sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court justice, analysts said the public would likely react violently if the Republicans continued the confirmation.
Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News last week: “This could become a mess that Republicans have to deal with.”
“It’s not just the committee’s vote or the official vote, or whether Kavanaugh will become a Supreme Court Justice, but the more important question is how Republicans handle the adjudication this time and how they treat the accusers,” Guy Cecil, director of the Organization for Priorities USA, the Democratic Party’s campaign support group, told the news channel.
The American people, however, have disagreements over whether to trust Ford or Kavanaugh’s testimony, which appears to be more suspicious of Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents said they were certain or could trust Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they were certain or could trust Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38% of respondents thought Kavanaugh may or may have lied while giving testimony, while only 30% said Ford was certain or might have lied.
After Flake pressed the consent button, the FBI was investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford took the oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh attacked her while drunk, when she was 17.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court judge of exposing his genitals in front of her when they attended a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start building new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is now launching a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this tech legend is called Inrupt, a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open-source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and what permissions people are given to access which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt project was to "rule the world."
“We have to start now,” he said of the startup project.
“Now is the moment of history.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows users to create their own “online personal data warehouse” or POD.
This data repository may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all are available on one browser and displayed simultaneously.
What’s unique about this online personal data store is that users have full authority to decide who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it “controlling personal data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of the Inrupt project is to make sure the company has the right resources, processes, and skills to help deliver Solid to everyone.
The company now has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that has been acquired by IBM, several developers who have signed contracts to work under the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not discuss with “Facebook and Google whether there was a complete change because all of their business models were fully upgradeable overnight.”
“We don’t need to ask permission from them.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Association at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential name in the debate over internet neutrality.
Despite launching the Inrupt project, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Association, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann received the Victoria Cross in World War 1
The celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Church of England's only clergy was awarded Queen Victoria's Cross in World War I as a warrior was held in his hometown.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he died after being shot four days later and never knew he had won the British Army's highest honor.
On Saturday, two of his grandsons unveiled a commemorative stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "a brilliant symbol" when the stone was displayed exactly 100 years after the victory that helped his grandfather win the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann commanded his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick fog, under heavy fire from rifles and machine guns."
He then rushed straight into the fire and with "great courage" led the battalion to the top, before dashing into a rifleman and knocking down three of the commandos.
Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month after the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “actions I could never have done myself, but there was humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann also placed a wreath after the Royal Brentwood Youth Band parade led.
Michael Vann said he felt "extremely honoured to be part of the parade" and that "the bravery of a true hero will be recognized by the support of so many people."
Martial arts fans stay up all night watching Bellator 206, but in the end they only get Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night waiting to see the Bellator 206 with a packed stand, but eventually being rejected for the main event.
The show's introduction from San Jose said there were 13 battles, including six on the main card and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, viewers in England were stunned as the screen turned into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel disrespected after they wake up close in the morning to watch the match.
A fan expressed on Twitter that turning the show into a children’s cartoon was like a “unfortunate joke.”
“The government stipulates that martial arts content shown at 6 a.m. is inappropriate, so they have to be turned into programs for children,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transfer.
"Peppa the pig," he said.
Bellator Chairman Scott Coker said that they are looking at the broadcast schedule to make sure a British audience can watch the show in the future.
Mr. Coker said, “I think if we play again, we can solve the problem.”
“But on that side it was 6 a.m. on Sunday morning and we couldn’t handle the problem until Sunday in our time zone, but it was Monday in their time zone.
But we are trying to find a solution.
Trust me, when people change programs, there's a lot of messages back and forth, and those messages aren't very friendly.
We tried to fix it, initially we thought it was due to a technical glitch.
But in the end, that’s not the case, it’s government regulation.
I can promise you this won’t happen next time.
We are going to reduce the number of matches to five, instead of the six as originally scheduled – five is the number of matches we usually offer and we have tried to provide excesses to the fans.
This is really an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'poor' about sexual orientation
Olympic ballerina Tom Daley said that as he grew up, he always felt inferior to people because of his sexual orientation – but that was his driving force for success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize “I didn’t look like anyone” until he studied in school.
Speaking on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne said he had spoken out about gay rights to bring “hope” to others.
He also said being a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off to get sick.
In Laverne's first issue, Daley appears as an abandoned person, saying he feels "poorly" everyone, because "his gender is not socially acceptable as clear sons and daughters."
“To this day, feelings of inferiority and difference still exist, becoming the motivation and strength for me to succeed,” he said.
He wanted to prove that he had “achieved something” so that people wouldn’t be disappointed to know the truth about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become an active advocate for the LGBT community and he uses his image at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to oppose discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he spoke up because he felt very lucky to be able to live openly without being discriminated against and wanted to bring “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion shared that he fell in love with a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black. The two met in 2013 and "suddenly fell in love."
Daley was married to the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said age disparities had never been an obstacle between the two.
“When you have to go through so much suffering as a child,” he said at the first Olympic Games when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone the same age as him who experienced ups and downs in his life.
The couple became the parents of Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "worldview" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, my goal was ‘I have to win gold,’” he said.
“But you know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was about to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to the 2012 Olympics in London – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘I can’t sit in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he took his last breath and even when he stopped breathing and died forever, I couldn’t finally admit that he had to be invincible.”
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
“I just know that it’s been my whole life’s dream – jumping in front of a crowd of fans at the Olympic Games, really, there’s no better feeling than that,” he said.
It was also an inspiration for him to choose his first song – Heather Small’s Proud – which accompanied him during his training towards the Olympic Games and still touched him every time he heard it again.

Mickelson lacks form on Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his form to avoid this record becoming a sad experience.
Mickelson played in the biennial event 12 times but captain Jim Furyk left him on the bench in the fourball and foursome series on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action in America, this five-time winner has to spend the day as a cheerleader and play the game in the hope of getting rid of the discomfort.
A 48-year-old golfer with a background in the air was never the ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, even if he was at the top of his form, because the wrong shots here would suffer heavy consequences.
And if this golf course is not enough yet, Mickelson also has to play in Sunday's 9th match against England Open champion Francesco Molinari. This week, Molinari teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches.
If the U.S. team, which is currently losing four points before the start of the 12-game series, wants to start impressively, Mickelson’s match is paramount.
Furyk expressed confidence in his golfer and didn’t say too much.
“He knows his role very well today, he pats me on the back, puts his arms around me and says he’ll be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
"He's very confident.
He is a legend and has contributed a lot to the team, both in the past and throughout this week.
I could never have imagined that he would play two games.
I can imagine more, but that’s how things go and we think it’s the right way.
He wants to play, just like everyone else.”
This Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record, becoming the most-played player in the Ryder Cup.
It could also be the end of his career at the Ryder Cup because the peaks of his personal record have never appeared in this Tournament.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses, and a draw, although Furyk said his presence provided invisible value to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's funny, he's funny, he likes to laugh at people. Having him in the group is really fun," he explained.
“I think the young players are happy to see him and this week is quite fun.
“What he has done is more than play.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the lead advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, has experienced that although his team has a lot of lead when entering singles matches at the end of the Ryder Cup season, the results can still be easily reversed in an uncomfortable way.
The Dane began playing in 1997 at Valderrama, in which their team, led by Seve Ballesteros, led by five points against the U.S. team but ultimately won only 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You always have to remind yourself that we’ve been ahead a lot at Valderrama; we’ve been ahead a lot at Brookline and we’ve lost, at Valderrama, we’ve won, but we’re struggling,” Bjorn said, with the face pictured after watching the Class of 2018 match with a 5-3 win on Friday and a 10-6 lead yesterday at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in the team that this is not the end.
You still have to be mentally focused tomorrow.
Go out there and play well.
The tournament is not over when the score is not yet on the table.
We have a goal to win the trophy this year and that is our focus.
I’ve always said that I focus on my 12 players, but we also understand the strength of your team – they are the best in the world.”
Excited about the performance of his golfers on the bumpy golf course, Bjorn added: “I’ll never say anything in advance.
Tomorrow will be another war.
Tomorrow is an individual show and will definitely be very different.
It would be great to play in pairs and everything goes smoothly. But when you play individually, all the possibilities of a golfer will be revealed.
That’s the message you have to share with every player, that they have to be ready to play their best tomorrow.
Now a pair of matches have to separate and each one has to be ready to play the best."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opponent’s captain, Jim Furyk expects his golfers to show better individual abilities than when playing in pairs, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself went through both directions in major turning points on the last day, having been a member of the winning team at Brookline before failing while the European team was hailed as "The Miracle in Medinah."
“I remember every single word,” he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the team’s captain in 1999, had gathered and encouraged the players before the last day of the competition.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’ll want to start as quickly as you see at Brookline, as you see at Medinah.
When the result is following a trend, the matches in the middle will be under a lot of pressure.
We build the squad that way and send players on the pitch strategically and try to do wonders tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned to lead the team and face Rory McIlroy in the top-flight match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other European players in the first series.
“I chose this group, in that order because I believe it’s the way to go,” Bjorn said of the option for his singles match.
Germany's new warship has been put on hold.
Local media reported that the latest German Navy destroyer was supposed to have run trials in 2014 to replace the old Cold War war warship, but it was at least until next year that it could be tested due to faulty systems and rising costs.
The Die Zeit newspaper quoted a military spokesman as saying: "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg destroyer, has now been delayed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery troubles hampered the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the former Bremen-class destroyer.
As such, these ships will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and sound tracks.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period – possibly deploying the latest destroyers away from national ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delay means that these modern warships – which are supposed to help Germany control outside countries – will become obsolete at the start of use, the Die Zeit newspaper noted.
The unfortunate F125 became headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to test the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
There was little information on the reason behind the ship's return, but German media said "software and hardware flaws" were serious, resulting in warships being completely useless for combat missions.
Software flaws are particularly serious as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship will be operated by a fleet of 120 sailors – just half of the manpower on the old Bremen-class destroyer.
At the same time, it can be seen that the ship’s weight increases significantly, leading to reduced performance and limited Navy capacity for future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to weigh twice as much as the same warship used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – is also a serious issue.
The project is said to have taken significant capital up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – while the initial estimated cost is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The issue of mobilizing the latest destroyers has become particularly important, given recent warnings of a shrinking German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged the Navy was “lacking warships capable of engaging in combat.”
The official said the problem has worsened over time, because the old ship has stopped operating but no replacement ships have been found.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships were eligible to join the Navy.
National Trust eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
A new study is underway in a Scottish Highlands estate to reveal how bats use natural landscapes to hunt for food.
Hopefully these findings will shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, tracked the journey of popular bats, soprano pipsistrelles, brown-eared bats and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe Garden Area in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be located at key locations around the research grounds to monitor the activity of these bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
The audio analyst will conduct an analysis of all the audio recordings and determine the sound frequency of the bat and the purpose of the sound of each specific bat genus.
Then maps and habitat reports of bats will be created to take a detailed picture according to the natural landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s natural conservation adviser, hopes the results will help determine which habitats are most important to bats and how each species lives in that environment.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management activities, such as grassland planting and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect the bat’s bean truss and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and light systems, fly trap paper, some chemical treatments for building materials, as well as pet cat attacks can also pose risks to bats.
The bat is not completely blind.
However, due to the habit of hunting at night, the ears are more useful than the eyes when stalking and catching prey.
They use a highly sophisticated echo positioning technique to identify obstacles on the fly.
The NTS is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, while attaching special importance to bats.
The organization has ten trained professionals who regularly conduct surveys, tests and sometimes take part in animal rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway. It is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Managing the land, David Thompson said the land was their ideal territory.
“Threave is a great habitat for bats,” he said.
“We have many old buildings, lots of trees and a good living environment.
But there is still a lot of mystery about bats, so the work here and at other facilities will help us better understand what bats need to grow further.”
He stressed the importance of checking the lives of bats before conserving them in lands, because accidentally destroying their breeding bean truss can kill up to 400 females and vomit, almost completely destroying the population.
Bats are protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their bean trusses.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an employee of the Scottish Batman Conservation Foundation, encouraged the community to join in.
“We still need to learn more about bats, and with many species, we can’t tell how far apart their populations are.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and his lawyer prepares to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the sexual charge against him was “fake news” and that someone “wanted to profit” by his name.
His lawyer is preparing to sue the German daily Der Spiegel for publishing the allegations.
The Portuguese forward who currently plays for Juventus has been charged with raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday: The player allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
In a video streamed on Instagram to 142 million followers hours after the allegations were announced, Ronaldo, 33, said the report was “fake news”.
“No, no, no.
What they say today is fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner said in front of the camera.
“They want to use my name to profit.
That's normal.
Say my name, they are famous, but that’s only part of the job.
I’m a happy person and everything is fine,” added the male player and smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel on the allegations, calling them “unacceptable reports of suspicion about private life.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation due to “moral harm with the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which could be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 at a high-end motel at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have returned to the player's room. According to records in Clark County Courthouse, Nevada, he is accused of raping her at the hotel.
Mayorga said Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" a "good guy", with only "1 percent" not good.
It has been reported that Ronaldo confirmed that the two sides had developed sexual relations, but based on consensus.
Mayorga also said she had been to the police station and had been photographed with injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to mediate outside the court because she was "afraid of revenge" and worried about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old said she is now seeking to overturn her previous settlement as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the allegations, Ronaldo was preparing to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but eventually this summer he moved to play for the Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million transfer deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' losing car manufacturer status
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" losing its position as the world leader in post-Brexit car manufacturing.
He added that it was "pretty worrying" when Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union without further agreement, it would stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 units last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain completely leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will have to stop production at this plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have also raised concerns about Britain leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would shut down its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of automakers is supply chain risk in the case of Brexit without another deal.
Toyota’s production line operates under the “just-in-time” principle, with parts delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union for production vehicles on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without another deal on March 29, there is a possibility of a disruption at the border and the sector fears it could lead to delays and shortages of spare parts.
Toyota said the company could not keep its inventory value for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so it would have to stop production.
Clark said Prime Minister Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future ties with the European Union would be “correctly adjusted to avoid border checks.”
“We need a deal. We want the best deal, not only to ensure success in the present, but also to make sure we capture this opportunity well,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“Evidence from Toyota as well as other car manufacturers suggests we need to ensure a successful continued supply chain.”
Toyota has not announced for sure how long it will stop production, but in the long run, it warns that additional costs will reduce factory competitiveness and eventually, workers will lose their jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a unite union convenor at the factory, said his members are increasingly worried: “In my experience, once I lose these jobs, there will never be again.
A government spokesman said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our relationship with the European Union in the future.”
White House Says Meeting Between Trump and Rosenstein May Be Delayed Again
The White House announced Sunday that Trump’s high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “a week away” as the fight over the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the alleged meddling in the Russian election, links between Trump and Russia’s aides and the possibility of the president obstructing the exercise of justice.
Trump’s dismissal of the deputy attorney general, followed by Mueller’s inability to operate independently, has sparked rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing headphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein declined to report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid speculation that he was about to step down.
Instead, his meeting with President Trump — who was visiting the United Nations General Assembly in New York at the time — is scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "didn't want" Rosenstein's dismissal but the meeting was delayed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing between Kavanaugh and Dr Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to spend a week investigating the allegations against Kavanaugh, while continuing to delay the full Senate vote.
President Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "The date of the meeting has not been set, possibly this week, which may be the reason for the postponement because of the other issues that are taking place in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll get the news soon and the press will be updated.”
Some reporters may disagree with the statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since Sept. 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the absence of press conferences was not due to dislike of TV reporters “too much,” though she once said: “I also agree that reporters are in fact a lot of things.”
She then suggested adding a direct link between President Trump and the press.
“The president is now doing more inquiring sessions than any previous president,” she added without giving evidence: “We have reviewed the number of press conferences.”
Sanders said there would still be press conferences but “if the press had a chance to ask the president directly, it would be much better than talking to me.
We’ve been trying a lot and you’ve seen a lot of work over the last few weeks, which will replace a press conference when you can speak directly to the president of the United States.”
Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or at press conferences when visiting officials.
Simple press conferences are often rare.
This week, in New York, the president should have stated the reason, but he appeared suddenly in strange form in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health Minister Writes Letter to European Union Employees Working in Health Sector in Scotland to Talk About Fear of Brexit
The health minister has written to European Union employees working in the health sector in Scotland to express their gratitude to the nation and expect the staff to remain behind Brexit.
Health Minister Jeane Freeman sent a letter with the message that he would resign within six months of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish government is committed to supporting the costs of applications for certification of the residency status of European Union citizens who are working in the public service sector that has been transferred.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During this summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union continue, which is expected to be made this fall.
But the British government is also stepping up its preparations for a scenario that may not reach an agreement.
I know that this is an uncertain time for all of you.
That’s why I want to reiterate that I now appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Moreover, colleagues from the European Union have provided valuable experience and skills to help strengthen and improve health services, while benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we look forward to you staying.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee Tigers' longitudinal defender Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ in Tennessee reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before half-time.
“He ran towards the vertical border and collapsed,” Reed said.
Trainers and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen at the vertical border before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further examination.
An official from Tennessee told Chris Harris at the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no specific information on the extent/type of injury" and Tennessee was trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student of the Reds, first played under Tennessee after moving back from Illinois.
He has a total of five games on Saturday before being eliminated from the game and he has a total of 18 games this season.
Foreigners buying property in the UK will be charged higher taxes
Foreigners buying property in the UK will be charged higher taxes, which will be used to help the homeless under Tory’s new policies.
This change will nullify Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.
The tax increase will apply to people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The finance ministry expects the policy to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year – to help the homeless.
Foreigners buying property in the UK will be charged higher taxes – the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Prime Minister Theresa May will announce today.
This change will successfully neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with a commitment to offering cheaper housing and targeting high-income audiences.
The tax hike will apply to individuals and businesses who don’t pay taxes in the UK, which will boost the government’s efforts to combat the current stagnation.
The surcharge – in addition to the current tax rate, which includes the higher taxes announced two years ago on second homes and homes purchased just for that – can be up to three percent.
The finance ministry expects the change to increase to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of new properties built in London have been sold to non-British citizens, which has pushed home prices up and made it harder for first-time buyers.
Many of the country’s affluent areas – especially in the capital – have become “ghost towns” as the majority of expats who buy homes spend most of their time in other countries.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to give many young people a chance to own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by taking land but not using it, and urged May to give up quotas on affordable homes to fix the “housing problem” in Britain.
Corbyn also announced a series of housing reforms aimed at attracting voters, including controlling rents and ending "no fault" deportations.
He also wanted to give councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my term to restoring the British dream – that life would be better for the new generation.
And that means re-regulation of the current chaotic housing market.
England will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, this does not mean that people who do not live in the UK and companies based abroad can easily buy homes as hard-working British residents.
For a lot of people, the dream of owning a house has become too far away and the stagnation is still huge.”
Jack Ross: ‘My last ambition is to lead Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "last ambition" was to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
Scot, 42, is facing the challenge of reviving the North East club, which currently holds third place in League One, three points behind first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to play for my country as a player.
I had a hat with the B logo and that’s what I wanted,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“My childhood years were associated with those Scottish games that took place at Hampden with my father, and that has always been what I remember.
However, that opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing the club.”
Sunderland's predecessors to Ross include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic said he felt no pressure as a successor to the great names at such a big club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me will now be judged by 'Can I bring the club back to the Premier League?'
The organisational structure and facilities at this club definitely belong to the Premier League,” he said.
“This is not a task to achieve easily, but I only consider myself a success if I can bring the club back to the tournament.”
Ross spent three years as a manager, after a stint as a management assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa restore his position after falling to the third division, and put St Mirren from the risk of relegation to the next season's champion.
Ross said he felt very comfortable throughout his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It’s probably a real turning point,” he recalled in his role as Alloa’s lead.
“I really believe I’m more suited to a management role than a player.
This sounds strange because I’ve been quite successful, had a good income and achieved certain achievements as a player.
But the game is usually not easy.
There are a lot of things you face every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of the job but I am satisfied with the management job.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I’m doing it, I feel most comfortable being myself throughout my adult life.”

Surveys show that the ideal time to enjoy a beer is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted sales for struggling pubs in the UK but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Bars and pubs saw sales rise 2.7% in July – but sales at restaurants fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s corporate consulting firm, put together the figures, saying: “The long-term shortfall and England’s entry into the World Cup round made July’s sales trend similar to June’s, when pubs increased by 2.8%, restaurants were hit harder.
Sales at restaurants that fell 1.8 percent in June worsened in July.
Bars and pubs that specialize in drinks have the fastest growth when compared to the drop in restaurants.
Bars that specialize in food are also affected by the heat, although not as severe as restaurants.
It seems like everyone just wants to go out for a drink.
Beverage sales at regulated pubs and bars increased by 6.6% during the month while food sales fell by 3%.”
Paul Newman, an analyst with the entertainment and hospitality industry RSM, said: “These results represent a trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales at restaurants.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to struggle, with sales falling 4.8 percent year-on-year while cost pressures are rising again.
“The long hot summer has been right at the worst time for food suppliers, not knowing in August when the weather is cooler could improve the current situation.”
Total revenue growth at pubs and restaurants, including newly opened locations, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand implementation.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s sales supervisor for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK has collected and analyzed data on work efficiency from 47 active groups, with combined revenues of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and that’s the industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that their parents don’t know about.
One in five children – some at the age of 11 – have secret social media accounts that parents and teachers don’t know about, the survey found.
Survey results of 20,000 middle school students show that the number of “virtual Insta” pages has increased significantly
The news has raised concerns about the rise of online pornography.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “primary” account for parents only
One in five children – some aged 11 – are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed rapid growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has added to concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said children use a "main" account with no bad content to show their parents, and also have their own account.
A mother accidentally finds the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, and sees a teenager calling on others to “rape me.”
According to a study by the UK Digital Content Enhancement Awareness Society and the Headmasters’ Workshop (HMC) at independent schools, 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two records, and half of them admit to having their own accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that many teens are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers can’t find.”
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as non-executive director at the regulator's annual meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Beattie sees this change as a great opportunity for sports coaches to use her rich playing experience in international arenas over the past decade.
“Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and worldwide athletics community, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by electing her to the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to act as a representative of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.
An American, who had won 200 metres and 400 metres gold medals at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, he had all four Olympic gold medals and he is now a permanent commentator for the BBC, having been unable to walk after experiencing a minor accident.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I can't go.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or be in any condition.
It was a tiring journey but to fully recover, learn how to walk again and now I am able to walk quickly!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Milk machine ads compare mothers to dairy cows that divide public opinion online
A company that specializes in lactators splits online opinion with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to milked cows.
To mark the launch of the product, which is considered "the world's first wearable and noise-free vacuum", consumer technology company Elvie launched an ad inspired by a satirical music video to show the freedom that the new suction machine brings to mothers.
The four mothers danced in a barn full of hay in a song that read: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tails and "In case you don't realize, this isn't my breasts, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues: “Suck the milk out, suck the milk out, I’m feeding the kids, suck the milk out, suck the milk out, I’m milking my girls.”
However, the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a lot of controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the audience, with many saying the ad took the “horrific” side of the dairy industry lightly.
“It’s a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must also become pregnant and give birth to milk, except that the cows are robbed of their mother’s cow within a few days of giving birth,” one person wrote.

Another commented: “This can be psychologically damaging for both mother and baby.
That’s right, why not use it to advertise milk pumps to breastfeeding mothers?”
Another commented: “This advertisement has no relevance.”
There were people who also defended the ad, a woman who admitted that she found the song "fun".
“I think this is a unique idea.
I'll buy myself one if I'm still breastfeeding.
Smoking milk really makes me feel like a cow.
This ad is a bit crazy but I understand its message.
This is a unique product,” another commented.
Another commented: “This is an interesting ad aimed at mothers who need to smoke milk (usually at work or in the toilet) and they feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement that praises or evaluates the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women's group revealed that they had danced with a milk-sucking machine hidden in their underwear.
The idea behind this campaign is based on the fact that many women who smoke milk to breastfeed say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie does not cause noise, does not have wires or tubes, and is neatly located inside a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, carry their baby, and even go out while they are smoking.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented, “The Elvie is truly a revolutionary product that deserves a bold introduction and encourages curiosity.
When comparing women to dairy cows, we want people to know about dairy products and the challenges involved, and to express in a fun and empathetic way the freedom that new dairy products bring to mothers.
This isn’t the first time Elvie has appeared on newspaper headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children has spiked despite the fact that the number of monthly cross-borders remains almost unchanged, in part because of the harsh arguments and policies put in place by the Trump administration that have made the process of bringing children to donors even more difficult.
Traditionally, most donors have been undocumented immigrants, and they are concerned that accepting an immigrant child could affect their own ability to stay in the United States.
The risk increased in June, when federal governments announced that potential donors and other adult members of their families would have to obtain fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people applying for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of donors or family members are here illegally, and most of them have criminal records.
So we are continuing to prosecute these individuals,” Albence said.
According to staff working in refugee camps, in order to be able to quickly handle cases involving these children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some donors to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, as standard previously.
Many will appear through video conference calls, rather than in person, to justify their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are found to be ineligible for patronage will be deported quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more anxious or depressed they become, which can lead to violent behavior or attempts to escape, according to staff at refugee camps and according to reports from the system in recent months.
Supporters said growing concerns at a larger facility like Tornillo, where they found a struggling child more likely to be overlooked due to the size of the camp being too large.
They added that sending children to cities with refugee camps without giving them enough time to prepare or saying goodbye to friends could be psychologically damaging for many children.
Syria asks U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw from the country immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return to their country, although the civil war has entered its eighth year.
Moualem, the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces had been on Syrian soil illegally, in the name of anti-terrorist forces, so "will be dealt with".
“They must leave Syria unconditionally and immediately,” he told the council.
Moualem stressed that the “war on terror in Syria is nearing its end” and that more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions leaving their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this holy war until we purge terrorist groups from the entire territory of Syria" and "the illegal presence of foreign forces".
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which specializes in training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 infantry in the war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions of the country were good enough for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "sowing irrational fear" that prevented refugees from returning.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to create conditions for refugees to return," he said.
“They are using political cards for humanitarian issues.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in Idlib’s last rebel region provided an opportunity to spur political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem said the agreement had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be wiped out".
United Nations Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee including the government and opposition members to draft the post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the commission, saying the committee’s work was limited to “considering the provisions of the current constitution” and warning against interfering in elections.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
Logically, Trump will win a re-election in 2020 unless impeachment and scandals end his term ahead of time, as liberals are hoping.
This is obviously “the most dramatic of a presidential term!”
So far, there have been no signs of heat loss.
Since 2014, the gold hour viewership rate has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News now has 2.4 million viewers at the golden hour, compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” topped the cable TV charts with more than 3.5 million viewers watching key news scores.
"Although not understood, many people are still attracted to the crematorium," said Neal Baer, who runs ABC's "Designated Survivor" television show, about a cabinet secretary becoming president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: and Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
She recalled a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
You asked why?
“He said, ‘Because he made me laugh,’” Miss Scovell told me.
This is an interesting thing in the context of chaos.
Of course, unlike what happens on TV, any move by Washington could determine Roe v. Wade’s future, or the reunification of immigrant families and the global economic situation.
Only some television viewers have the privilege of choosing their channels.
Not only that, this is even more appealing than the news item when you spend six hours watching a group of experts debate Bob Woodward’s use of “in-depth” information in his book “Fear,” or Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-haired bombber jacket (“a glorious outfit,” the Washington Post writes) and the implications of Trump’s over-the-top dissections.
I changed my mind about Super Mario.
“One of the things he does is always bring you something new every night that makes it look like a reality TV show,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of “Pawn Stars” when talking about the cast and the unexpected happenings on Trump’s daily show (such as going to the N.F.L. or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t miss an episode or you won’t catch up with the trend.
This week I had a conversation with Fleiss, outside the house on the north shore of Kauai under the 80-degree heat, but he hid in the house to watch MSNBC while filming for CNN.
He couldn’t leave the TV screen, especially when Brett Kavanaugh was being presented to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on the table.
“I remember the days when we were doing those crazy programs and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside pours into the most intense midterm elections for the race to the White House.
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district is witnessing a cash storm, as the congressional relocation has forced two incumbents to race for the same seat.
The recent geopolitical rearrangement in Pittsburg County knocked out Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is racing against the Republican candidate, Keith Rothfus, who now represents the former 12th arrondissement in Pennsylvania, which shares multiple territories with the new 17th arrondissement.
The map was re-planned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former counties were rigged in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district became a financial race between the party's main sponsors, the Democratic Committee on Congressional Campaigns (DCCC) and the Republican Committee on National Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb was a household name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election that was widely watched in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The position previously belonged to Republicans for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the county.
Political commentators have rated the Democratic Party higher.
The United States considered sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China, but later withdrew.
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing and Washington for almost no objection.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and the president once owned a hotel in Panama until business partners fired the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions about not recognizing Taiwan", Heather Nauert, a State Department spokesman said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalty is only for El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include cutting financial aid and visa restrictions on some subjects, would cause major losses for the Central American country that currently has high rates of unemployment and crime.
As internal meetings are ongoing, North American and Central American officials have postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economics to reorganize a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials had announced that they wanted to continue to conduct the conference, which would help end the U.S. sanctions consideration for El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, when it signals the implementation of administrative measures.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no hard-line message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their information was corroborated by an outside analyst with close ties to the authorities and also spoke anonymously.
Research History
The next bomb could be special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s obstruction of justice, which now has plenty of evidence in the public record.
It is believed that Mueller is moving his investigation to the issue of collusion between President Trump and Russia in the presidential election.
If there is a change in the party in Congress, President Trump will have difficulties in Congress, right before the start of the campaign to win voters, and even those in the same party.
There are a lot of issues, I don’t mean to mention that President Trump’s departure is inevitable — just like his counterparts in Europe.
Both sides of the Atlantic need to make choices and this will affect the long duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, if the West also agreed to oppose and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter.
History revolves around such milestones, and the uncompromising struggles of the democratic party will increase or delay.
Americans face some of these challenges.
What if President Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who controlled the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been sitting in a fire since reports last year that he had secretly proposed eavesdropping on the president and speculating that the president was unfit for office.
Rosenstein testified that the Times newspaper's information was inaccurate.
“How would we react if the F.B.I.’s new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh was incomplete or unfair – or if he confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonesty?
Most of all, will we vote midterms for a Congress so that the agency will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these challenges, democracy will lose power for a long time.
But I believe that we will not fail, because I had a lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew expelled to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that occupied our home.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, she gave me the opportunity to light candles on the altar on the Sabbath.
With my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

The optimism of Graham Dorrans of Rangers ahead of the clash with Rapid Vienna
Rangers played Rapid Vienna on Thursday, learning that the win over the Austrians, following an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would give them the edge to win the group stage G of the Europa League.
Knee injuries prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance in the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for more amazing things.
"It's a good thing for us because Villarreal is a strong team," the 31-year-old said.
“We were in the game with the belief that we would win a point.
We could have won at the end of the game but the draw was not a bad result.
They probably played better in the first half but we counterattacked in the second half and were in better form.
Next Thursday will be an important match in Europe.
Hopefully we can win three points but it will be a tough game because they had good results in the previous game, but with the support of the fans, I’m sure we can get through and win good results.
Last year was a difficult period, I had injuries and changes at the club but now I have a very good feeling.
Good squad, good players with good form and good training quality.
Hopefully we can continue to go deeper to reap a successful new season.”
Women Are Worried About Losing Sleep Because of Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants were well aware of what they were interested in, few spoke with family members.
About half of Nationwide’s study participants said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Nationwide’s vice president of life insurance business.
Here are the steps to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t mentally prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes first.
Talk with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how care is taken, as those choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor with you: Your advisor can also help you come up with a payment method for those costs.
Your financial options for long-term care purposes may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or self-purchase insurance with your own money – as long as you have the money.
Prepare the legal documents carefully: Avoid possible legal battles.
There is a health care plan available so you can appoint a trusted individual to monitor the medical care process and ensure that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider authorizing your financial account.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure to pay your bills if you can’t afford it.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
List those details so you’re always ready.
“What about not only financial matters but also doctor-related matters?” asked Martin.
“What drugs are there?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have you made a plan yet?”

His injuries were not life-threatening and police called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, the death toll is expected to rise.
Contacts were cut off, and aid workers were unable to receive any information from the Donggala government, an area north of Palu close to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a fjord on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a capital stretching over 300 km (180 mi) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The capital, an administrative area under the administration of the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the two major sectors of the economy in Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important sector here, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 magnitude occurred in southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, causing a tsunami to hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital in eastern Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami as high as 10m, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck the capital of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing damage and panic as people recalled the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
The quake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly concentrated in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of temporary tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, in Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report on domestic violence and opposing the arrest warrant, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to police reports, when a woman tried to call the police to report on the alleged crime, he grabbed the phone.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su and has to file a $500 guarantee, according to the KTUU report.
He appeared in court on Saturday, claiming he was "certainly not guilty" when asked to defend himself, according to the report.
Palin faces three A-class charges, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with minor B, jailed for a day and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently taking place at the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with reports of domestic violence and possessing weapons in a state of unconsciousness related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans’ groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Earthquake wave in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks have been cut off, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos being posted on social media show the moment of the disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck.
Federal prosecutors are proposing the death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are proposing the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the attack on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on October 10.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" caused serious bodily injury, according to the announcement of a proposal for the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges can be sentenced to death, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury charged Saipov with 22 counts of attempted murder, often used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and accused him of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "detailed planning and pre-stations", prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried out the attack as "tremendous, cruel and inhumane".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian," the court said in a statement.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the Southern District of New York executed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also ordered the ISIS flag to be flown in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s federal defense lawyers, said they were “completely disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.
“We think that the decision to execute the death penalty instead of accepting a plea for life in prison without the possibility of release would only prolong the damage of the event to those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to bring the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say NIGEL FARAGE must take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to 'mobilize the people' during a rally at a conservative party conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians must "feel the heat" from European Skeptics - as one of Prime Minister Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
Conservative supporter Peter Bone said during a rally in Birmingham that the UK was “out of the union” right now if Farage was Brexit minister.
But the challenge May faced as he tried to reconcile deep divisions among conservative MPs who supported staying in the European Union took part in a protest against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to keep up with a compromise plan amid attacks from Brexit backers, remaining backers and the European Union.
The allies insisted she would push forward by trying to reach a deal with Brussels despite the backlash – and forced European Skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between its plans and the “current state of chaos”.
Bone said during the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "oppose the Chequers plan".
He suggested Farage should remain in the Senate and be responsible for talks with Brussels.
“If he’s the one responsible, now we’re probably out of the coalition,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit but we need to oppose the Chequers plan.”
He testified to his opposition to the European Union: “We do not fight in world wars to subjugate others.
We want to build our own laws.”
Bone rejected the proposal that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the coalition is completely false.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also present at the rally, telling reporters: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Not many people approve of the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for this plan, which usually doesn’t happen to our party, our activists, who are willing to call for the support of the people and vote for us in the first place.
Let go of the Chequers plan and listen to the people.”
In a message to May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their seats as they keep their promises to the people."
Farage said politicians must take part in the protests to "feel the heat" if they change the decision made during the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us — the people — and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to give up Brexit and we’re here today to say ‘we’re not going to let you do that’.
In a message to supporters, he added: “I want to let the political class, who are intent on changing Brexit, feel the heat of the current situation.
“We are mobilizing the people who have brought Brexit victory and we will never surrender until we become an independent, self-governing and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, the remaining supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour protest in the city centre.
Some activists held up Conservative Party banners against Brexit after debuting the group this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives over the security issues they were facing at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who have told us that they can control the IT system and all the technologies that provide Canada, including the issue of borderless free trade in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete joke.
“Brexit is not a good thing,” he added.
Warren is determined to run for president.
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she would be determined to "elect the president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future when speaking at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November, in a race with GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who served as co-chairman of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
People speculate that she could take over Trump’s position in 2020.
Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the town hall since Trump took office.
One participant asked her about her intention to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to get involved in politics in order to reform the government and to have a woman at the top.
Arrested in the shooting of LSU player Sims
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dyteon Simpson's arrest, 20, at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died," Sheriff Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, on sports channel 247.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene, possessing a weapon, and confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was immediately arrested and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
As a teenager with a height of 1.98m and growing up at Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 games in the official squad last season with an average playing time of 17.4 minutes, winning 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton won the world championship after winning against Sebastian Vettel
Valtteri Bottas clearly had an advantage over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday as Mercedes remained a strong team in the season.
From the starting point, Bottas had a good start and successively surpassed Hamilton to defend his position in the first two laps and caused Vettel to battle his own teammates.
Vettel entered the first pit and abandoned Hamilton upon re-entering the track, a decisive act.
The Mercedes got into the pit after Vettel, but Hamilton got ahead as the driver in the Ferrari was forced to slow down to avoid risk after two stages to defend third place.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the race and finished seventh at the end of the first leg on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead during the race as he did not change his tyres to reach the finish line quickly and overtook Kimi Raikkonen to win the fourth place.
He eventually entered the pit in the 44th round but was unable to speed up the remaining eight rounds when Raikkonen won the fourth place.
It was a tough race because Valtteri did a great job on the weekend and it was a really good racer.
Finally the team had an excellent race to win the number one and number two," Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday's campaign because she insisted she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about the Supreme Court's allegations of sexual assault on Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking during the West Virginia campaign, the president did not directly target Ford’s announcement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was going on in the Senate showed people were “bad and dishonest.”
“Something has happened and what’s been going on in the last days in the Senate has been amazing, you can feel the anger, you can see the angry, the bad and the annoying and the dishonest,” he said.
“When they look at the articles and read the leaked news, they say, ‘Oh, I’m not the one doing it.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked the news, right?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document, didn't you? - "Oh my God, what's going on?
No, no, no.
I didn’t leak.”
Come on, wait a minute.
We leaked... No, we didn’t do that,” the president parodied the senator’s words.
Feinstein was sent a letter by Ford detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July and the information was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that her office leaked the information.
“I don’t cover up Dr. Ford’s allegations, I don’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
“She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it as secret as she asked me to.”
But the president seemed unhappy about her refusal, and he commented during Saturday night's campaign: "I'm going to tell you about that, it's really very bad body language.
She probably didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president said Democrats are using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You will find meaning and discomfort because they don’t care who they’re going to hurt, they want power and control,” Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars won 5-3 against Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's defeat of Belfast Giants in the Elite League by winning 5-3 in the second leg at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had two early goals thanks to goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie drew for the home team before Dwyer scored extra points for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard continued to equalise for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored twice to help the team win the final.
It was the third defeat in the team's Elite League season led by Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2–1 in a match played in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth encounter between the two sides this season, and the Giants have won the previous three games.
Dwy's opening goal in the fourth minute when the clock was only 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaulll and David Rutherford also helped Beauvillier double the goal apart just four minutes later.
In the early minutes, Sullivan helped the team shorten the score in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt became a player who helped Cownie level the score in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first half when scoring the second goal at the end of the half.
The hosts agreed and Bouchard again leveled the score with a spectacular score at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen put Dundee ahead of the game at the end of the second half and he scored his team's fifth goal in the final minutes of the match.
The Giants have lost four of their last five games, now resting to await their next match against Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controllers have sacrificed their lives to save hundreds of passengers aboard the plane from the earthquake.
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are being hailed as a hero after his death to ensure that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers can take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many went missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to rage in the area and many are trapped in the ruins of Palu City.
Although his colleagues fled to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower swaying by strong winds at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the air traffic control tower because he thought it had collapsed.
Then he died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision saved lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he stopped breathing before the plane reached Palu.
“Our hearts are broken when we receive this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, a spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency said it was difficult to reach the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The death toll continues to rise as many bodies remain trapped under the rubble and we have not yet reached many people,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to six meters high have devastated Palu, where mass funerals will be held on Sunday.
Military aircraft and commercial aircraft provide aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute there is an ambulance carrying the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Small markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to support survivors but we don’t know how the situation is there.
This is a tragedy, but the situation can get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the nation's military: "I wish you all would work day and night to complete all the missions related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, including more than 550 deaths.
Air Niugini says there is still a man missing after a plane crash in Micronesia
The flight operator, which crashed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, said one man was missing after a previous statement that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that, until Saturday afternoon, we had not been able to find a male passenger.
The airline said it has worked with local agencies, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about passengers, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
Airlines said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all of them remained in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are yet to be determined.
Aviation and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed at the watershed shortly after leaving the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was missing the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was at a very low altitude.
“This is a good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others could wade through deep water to the waist to reach emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby while repairing the wharf also helped rescue them by using float boats to pick up people on shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet) deep.
Data from the aviation safety network shows 111 people have died in accidents of airlines registered in the PNG network over the past two decades, but none related to Air Niugini.
The analysis said that at the time of the night the girl was burned alive.
The plaintiff was based on Saturday’s filing during a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified in court for hours as an intelligence analyst.
He demonstrated to the jury how to use the mobile record to sum up the movement of defendant Quinton Tellis, 21, and victim Jessica Chambers, 19, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from a mobile phone number indicating Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous statement, the Clarion Ledger reported.
The data showed that his cell phone was at the same location as Chambers’s while he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another conflicting detail was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Mobile phone records show that they have only known each other for about a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and communications from his phone.
“He took you out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense lawyer is expected to begin closed-door discussions on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury’s trial that day.
High Breed: What is positive hip hop?
The trio of hip hop artists wanted to oppose the negative perceptions of the genre by bringing positive messages into their music.
The High Breed group, from Bristol, claims hip hop has ceased to communicate political messages and address social issues.
The group wanted to bring this genre back to the right origin and repopulate the active hip hop music.
Artists such as the Fugees and Common Group have gained more popularity in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
NY nurse sues couple who fired her after text message "racist"
A New York nanny has sued a couple who fired her for discrimination after she accidentally received a wrong message from her mother complaining that she was "a black person."
The couple rejected them as racists, calling the case an “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed frustration when she discovered the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of employment in 2016.
“No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the confusion, Plasco-Flaxman "discomfortably" fired Maurice, who said that the African-American nanny who was about to quit was doing a bad job and that she hoped for a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid a day’s wages and went to Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple to seek compensation for the dismissal with a $350 a day compensation for the six-month period for the job she was hired to receive money despite not signing any contracts between them.
“I want to show them, look, you can’t do things like that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple objected to allegations that they were racists, saying it was reasonable to end Maurice’s work for fear that they could not trust her after offending her.
“My wife sent her a message she didn’t intend to send.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But can you give your child to someone you offended, even by mistake?
What about the newborn?
Tell me."
When comparing the case to an exorbitant case, Plasco said that his wife had given birth for two months and was in "a very difficult situation."
“How would you deal with someone like that?
This is not a thing to do,” the investment banker added.
In the midst of the legal case, public opinion was quickly pointed at the couple on social media, denigrating their behavior and the logic of the story.
Paddington publisher fears that readers won’t be interested in the story of a talking bear, the letter says.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book became widely accepted, the letter said: “It’s hard to put yourself in someone else’s shoes when you first read the book.
It’s great that we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
When talking about her father, a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children’s book from a small toy bear, he still felt optimistic when her work was rejected, she added during the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication, which was a “mixed merry” after his death last year.
When talking about Paddington, she described him as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was always quietly proud of his success.
“He’s a pretty quiet man, and he’s not an energetic person,” she said.
“But since Paddington really does exist with him, it’s almost like having a child and it’s got some success: you’re proud of them even if they don’t really exist.
I think you've taken Paddington's business that way.
Although it was the product of his creativity and imagination, he always won a place for Paddington.”
My daughter passed away and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
As soon as she landed her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
“I called Nad often to say it was bad and she shouldn’t have to,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying she would stop breathing for two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you soon.
I will always be with you.
The doctors injected the heart medicine and slowly pulled the tube out of her body.
She stopped breathing a few times and this was the last time.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was not over yet.
I can’t cry or scream or cry because I’m with my family and people.
I have to be the one to bind them.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who is still saddened by her daughter’s passing, boarded the plane along with other passengers facing the challenge she would have to overcome.
“No one knows,” she said.
“I bowed my head and cried all the time.
It was hard to explain, but on the flight I felt sorry for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.”
A grieving woman posts postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are trying to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Davis’s son Tyler, then 13 years old, suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to be in the feeling that I have to go through every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a grin.
“Everyone knows about it because of the laughter.
They used to say the boy’s laughter lit up every room.”
However, he quit his job before committing suicide because he found himself “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, died just like his brother after taking his own life.
Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that there will be a chain reaction.”
Davis designed the cards, “to let people know that there are always people you can meet, talk to, or even make friends with.
Don’t live in silence – you need to talk.”
Humphreys, who had been a friend of Mrs Davies for many years, lost her partner Mark, 15 years ago, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He’s not talking about feelings of boredom or disappointment or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed he changed his attitude.
He’s in the mood for school on Christmas Day — when kids open presents and he doesn’t look at them or anything around him.”
She said her husband’s death was a huge loss for them, but they still had to try to overcome: “This has caused a huge hole in our family.
It broke our hearts.
But we all continue to live and fight it.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the air as the FBI begins its investigation
Flake said on Saturday that "I think, if we can actually get something like what he's been asking for - a time-limited, limited-range investigation, we can collect a little bit," he added, adding that he feared committees would "get caught up" in partisan squabbling.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their procrastination is just a matter of time.
Midterm elections have been going on for five weeks, on Nov. 6 — if expected, Republicans who are in very bad shape will be even weaker in their efforts to find the representative they want to vote for the highest office.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbying in support of Kavanaugh, who had served as a White House aide under President Bush, so he could reach out to his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes the reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there will be 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Mike Pence, who is now vice president, to untangle the knot and confirm his candidacy in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'significantly reduced' under Kim's rule
The number of North Korean defectors has fallen sharply since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said last year there were 1,127 defections – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tightening border controls between North Korea and China and the large percentage of smugglers arrested were key elements of the change.
North Korea has not made public comments.
Most defectors from North Korea were eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most defectors flee through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea, and they can easily cross the heavily protected DMZ between the two countries.
China views defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to repatriate.
Relations between North and South Korea — technically still in a state of war — have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on denuclearization.
The moves followed a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where both sides agreed to extended terms for advancing to the Korean peninsula’s denuclearization.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-Ho blamed the US sanctions for causing delays in the process.
“Without any trust on the U.S. side, there would be no confidence in our national security, and in such a case, there is no other way that we would unilaterally find our own disarmament,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh an “excited element,” and says he’s not fit for the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi has called the nominee for the position in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, an "extremist" and said he was temporarily unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented during an interview that took place on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help, but I think if a woman ever did, they would call it an ‘excitement element,’” Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh insists on denying allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both minors.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh expressed a great deal of emotion, at times when he almost cried out and got sick of talking about his family and five months of high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democratic Party before the committee, calling the charges against him a "deeply planned assassination" due to anger over Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he was unfit for the position in the Supreme Court, as he clearly demonstrated his anti-Democracy behavior.
“I think he removed himself from his position when he made his statements and his treatment of the Clinton family and the Democratic Party,” she said.
Pelosi declined when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say this — if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only not in the Supreme Court position but he’s also in court,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeals in D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s ability to rule against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh dodged questions about whether he would change some Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not a time for someone who is radical, biased in court and hopefully we’ll say, ‘this isn’t great,’” Pelosi said.
Women need to take advantage of it.
This is really a heavy criticism, month after month, year after year the anger gets bigger, and she can’t overcome it without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Steinem told me after 45 years.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, but you?”
She went on, “I’ve been helped a lot by a woman, she’s a senior director, she said she also cried when she was angry but to form a reaction when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she just talked to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And you keep crying.
And I think this is great.”
You are allowed to cry so that this behavior is part of the escape for rage because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my deepest memories of working at my first company was that it was a male-only place, I used to cry when there was an angry outbursts, which was when I was struck by an older woman – the cold manager who always scared me – pulled me into the stairs.
She told me, “Don’t ever let them see you cry.”
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and happy because they’re with you.”
Patricia Schroeder, later a Democratic congresswoman in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught cheating on a boat called Monkey Business and left the race, Schroeder was disappointed, saying there was no reason why she could not run for president on her own.
Thirty years later she smiled and told me, “It wasn’t a wise decision.”
“There have been seven other candidates in the race, and they need another candidate.
Someone called the race "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Due to her late involvement in the campaign, she lost the fundraising campaign, so she vowed that she would not run unless she raised $2 million.
The war has failed.
She found that some of her supporters gave her $250 instead of $1,000 to support the male candidate.
She wondered, “Do they think I’m down?”
When she announced that she would not launch an official campaign, she overcame the emotion – expressing gratitude to those who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it harder to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, she angered by gender discrimination – that she was infuriated.
“You might think I’ve had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls of how the press reacted to her.
“You thought Kleenex was the sponsor of my company.
I remember thinking about what they were going to put on my gravestone?
“Are you crying?”
US-China trade war could be a good sign for Beijing
Experts say that the prelude to the trade war between the United States and China has stalled, and that the war will continue, a rift between countries that could be an advantage for Beijing.
Earlier this year, Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued his first warning by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The escalation has been increasing in recent weeks with tariffs worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) hitting half of Chinese imports into the United States.
Beijing has retaliated by raising tariffs from five to ten percent to $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to retaliate in line with U.S. actions and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to shake up anytime soon.
Getting Washington to make concessions means Beijing has to make demands, but publicly succumbing to the U.S. is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts say that if Beijing can put the right moves in place, the long-term pressure of a trade war with the United States could be a positive signal for China by easing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The reality is that a political decision in Washington or Beijing can start an economic relationship in either country and this is actually far more dangerous than previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a Asia-focused research expert at the new Center for American Security.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for refugees to voluntarily return and is calling for help to rebuild the country that has been ravaged by a more than seven-year war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the national situation is more stable and secure thanks to advances in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to renovate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore living conditions.
All current conditions are available for voluntary return of refugees who have left the country because of terrorism and economic conditions that affect their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million other people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the nation would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that financed the uprising.
Europe to win the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points against the U.S. team.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who has participated in most tournaments, threw his shot into the water at the third serve in the 16th hole, admitting he lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all rounds and became one of four players to have won 5–0 since the current season began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5 & 4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world’s top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England’s Ian Poulter, who may have played the last Ryder Cup match of his career.
A veteran player of eight Ryder Cup seasons, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the greatest champion of all tournaments with a total score of 25.5.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t stop it.
This was a really tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing and trusting me.
I am so happy to receive the cup.
As for my team, I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said of feelings after Europe’s victory.
He passed the torch to compatriot John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2–1 in a singles match on Sunday.
“It’s a great honour to be able to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up and I admire him very much,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup tournaments.
Statistics by one of the greatest players of all time show that he has won 14 major titles and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team did their best to find tickets for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who were top qualified golfers of the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team’s disappointing performance, “I’m proud of the players, they fought very well.
This morning we had a hard time due to the high temperatures in Europe.
We've been eliminated.
Please honor Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 players on the team played very well.
We will refocus the squad, I will play the PGA in the United States and the Ryder Cup and we will continue to win the top of the table.
I love all 12 players and I am proud to be captain.
I salute you guys with my hat.
We played very well.”
Update on Red tide phenomenon: Decreased red tide density in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Association shows that the density of the red tide has decreased in much of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, algal blooms have been reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties – this causes the red tide density to decrease.
The phenomenon of the Red tide spread for about 130 miles along the northern coast of Pinellas to the south of Lee County.
Small patches were also found within 10 miles off Hillsborough County, but fewer locations than last week.
Red tides have also been observed in Pasco County.
Average densities along the coast or offshore Pinellas County have been reported over the past week, low to high densities off the coast of Hillsborough County, low to high densities in Manatee County, low to high densities off the coast of Sarasota County, low to high densities off Charlotte County, low to high densities along the coast or offshore at Lee County, and low densities at Collier County.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Respiratory irritation has not been reported in northwestern Florida over the past week.
