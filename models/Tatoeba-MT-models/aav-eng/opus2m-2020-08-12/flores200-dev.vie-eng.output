The blade of a modern ice shoe is a double tongue and has a bark in the middle, a double blade that keeps a shoe on a better ice face, even in a corner.
By the lower part of the blade that bends, when the blade bends to one side or the other, the side of the contact with the ice is also curved.
This helps the user to slide the ice. If the shoe goes to the right, the ice goes to the right, and if the shoe goes to the left, the ice slips to the left.
To get back to the initial energy level, they have to remove the energy that they've loaded from the light.
They do this by launching small light particles called "photon."
Scientists call this process "simplific," because atoms are inspired by light, creating the radiation of light particles, and light is a kind of radiation.
The next drawing shows that the nuclear is projecting the photons.
The cheese-tons are even smaller than the atomic structure!
After hundreds of hours of light on the light, the hair ends to burn and the light is not bright anymore.
