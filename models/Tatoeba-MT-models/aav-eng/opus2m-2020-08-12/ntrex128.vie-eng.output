Congresses of Wales (AM) were concerned about ‘ being like a mess. ’
There's a certain concern of some Congressal Congress regarding changing their status to MWP.
The problem arose by planning on changing the Congress to the Wales Institute.
The convention delegates at the Theocratic Ministry School may be a problem for the opposite direction.
One of the Congress's delegates said that his party was worried that "the words would spell with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who are not native of Wales are: In Wales, twp means temporary and pwp.
One representative of the Party pointed out that the whole "not proud" party and proposed other names.
And one of the Republicans shared his party "no prejudice" about the change of name, but it didn't forget to write the MWPs are easily turned into Mupet.
In the terms of the Walesian w, the same is said to be the word of the British Yorkshire.
The Congress Committee is now preparing the bill regarding changing names, stating: "The final decision on any of the titles of Congress, of course, would be concern for the delegates itself."
Wales government law in 2017 gave its own name to the Wales Congress.
In June the committee announced the results of a national convention of suggestions for finding a contractal basis for calling the Congress of Wales.
In view of the title story of Congress, the Heavens Committee on Wales or WMP project, but the result of the demand for the Senate of Wales.
International delegates are making other projects, but efforts to achieve unity can be a concern for the Branch Committee, Elin Jones, who has been assigned to the bill for the next few weeks.
The edit bill will include other changes in the way the Congress works, including rules of Congress and government design.
The Congressers will offer their final votes for the question what should be a change in their status when they make a suggestion about the reforming bill.
The people of Macedonia voted in a national request for change in their country's name
The votes vote on Sundays about whether they change their country's name into the North Macedonia Peace.
The worldwide vote was established in an effort to resolve the conflict for decades with Greek neighboring nations, where there was also a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long confirmed that the name of the northern neighbors corresponds to his own territory and has repeatedly opposed to becoming a member of the EU and NATO of your country.
President Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, a member of the anti-international team, declared that he would cancel the vote.
However, the people who supported the universal demand, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claimed that change was the cost of entering EU and NATO.

"In the historical sense, the elders that I was contacted to share that every corner of the street had a bar and a church," said Mr. Adams.
"To this day, there is no church without bar."
He saw that the disappearance of the bars was acceptable.
He said, "Man has many ways to communicate."
"The bars are no longer public living rooms where everyone comes back regularly."
As for the churches, he was concerned that the money from selling possessions would not last as much as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later, all will be back at the starting line."
He added that these churches could be replaced by the buildings of many of the Gnobs, which would not help to keep the local dignity.
He added, "A little part of those people who buy apartments in those public buildings will be white people, and then the prospect of closing churches will come faster than ever because there's no reason for the inhabitants of those apartments to become teachers here."
Both churches were built by white groups before Beethoven became a black town for the Metropolitan community in the 1870 ’ s, becoming St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white church Fathers moved in the 1930s.
A group of color - worshiping groups had taken over the site.
St. Martin's had been taken by a black church under the management of the priest John Howard Johnson, who was head of a carcassing carcass on 125th Street, a shopping street in Toretto, who opposed the rental or urged the black people.
A fire in 1939 broke the building down, but when Cha Johnson’s people planned to rebuild it, they set the bell.
Pastor David Johnson, the son of Cha Johnson and successor at St. Martin's, proud to call the bells "the bell of the poor."
"A cultural treasure" and "a historical treasure of history."
The expert, Tiffany from Michigan University, also noted that this was the first bell of the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who pursued a bigger bell in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriamweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's for the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some of which are provided by church leaders, other problems by the New Testament.
The minister of the country’s ministers, including the religious leaders, mentioned in July with the concerns that the Church would try to transfer the money to the church, even though they were not involved in renting architects and contractors.
Some religions are not pleased with the lack of transparency on the part of their churches.
The shark attacked the 13-year-old kid who was diving the sea in California.
A shark attacked and caused a 13-year-old boy to get hurt while diving in California last Saturday, the first day of the harvest, the authorities.
What happened before 7:00 a.m., right near Beacon's coast in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV station that he was driving with his friends about half an hour in the morning, and then he heard him cry for help, and then all the other boat came out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he thought it was just a pleasant scream when he was caught, but then he said, "I was bit!
I'm bited!"
The whole part of the kid's bone was exposed," Hammel noticed as soon as you got to the boy's place.
"I tell everyone to get out of the water right away: ‘ There are sharks there!" Hammel added.
He was sent by plane to the Reservative Hospital in San Diego, where the boy was in a dangerous situation.
The shark's name is the killer of an unidentified attack.
The rescueman, Captain Larry Hobbes, shared in a news conference that they found a shark in this area a few weeks ago, but they determined that it wasn't a dangerous shark.
Perseus adds that the victim has to endure severe trauma in his upper body.
The officials had closed doors to the beaches from Ponto coasts in Casablad's to Ecinitas in 48 hours of the mission to investigate and secure.
Leland revealed that there are over 35 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not in danger.
The strategy to make the market beautiful in Britain's England's English.
Sainsbury's pushing Boots, Superdrug and Debrehams with traditional ways of showing, where there's always some help at all.
It's part of a huge push into the market that's worth 2,8 billion English boards, where it's going to grow while the number of fashions and users go down, the greater beautiful things are going to be tested at 11 stores per country, and the size of the testing in more than the next year if there's a good sign.
The investment of beautiful restaurants appeared when companies looked for ways to take advantage of the TV bar, the surfer and the household.
Sainsbury's said that for the first time they doubled their beautiful product to 3,000 products, there were brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The brands that are available as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with the same branding areas as showing in the store like the Boots.
The mayor is also re-arming his Boutique production line so that most of the products are pure plants - which are growing by young customers.
In addition, Fragance Shop's perfumerance will try to reduce the cost at two Sainsbury's store, the first store opened in Croydon, south of London, on the last week and the second store opened at Selly Oak, Birmingham, at the end of this year.
The online shopping and turning to buy a small amount of food every day at local convenience store means that companies have to put more blood in their attention in order to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, director of Sarinsbury's director, says that restaurants will become more and more like the store stores when the mayor tries to deal with the benefits of Aldi and Lidl with more services and nonviolities.
Sainsbury's, has put Argos' restaurants into hundreds of stores, and has also introduced some of the Hirsats' bars since they bought both brands two years ago, which has motivated the number of commodities and made it more productive.
Supervistendently tried to improve his beauty and medicine, but he failed.
Sainsbury's tested the business with Boots in the early 2000s, but cooperation ended after a problem involving how to divide the goods from the goods in the markets.
New strategy was given after Sarinsbury's sold 281 of his medicines to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds, with 125 million pounds in three years ago.
Having known Lloyds will contribute to a part of the plan, by adding a series of remote skin care brands including La Roche-seay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of the Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We've changed our faces and feelings of beautiful rows to raise the environment for our clients.
We've also invested in special training for employees, who're going to give their advice directly.
A series of our brands are designed to fit every demand and environment as well as the suitable places that are in harmony with what we are now an attractive stop, challenging the traditional shopping challenge."
Peter Jones ‘ raged ’ after Holly Willoughby withdrew the contract of 11 million pounds.
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, was "resolved" after the director of Holly Willoughby's TV program pulled out of 11 million pounds in his business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their furniture trade and their Truly.
The couple's business is likened to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old program of this Morning went to Instagram to announce that you're going to leave.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den, made the star Peter Jones angry when she withdrew from their super-profit business practices at the end of the minute -- to focus on her own new fat contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
In a stressful meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, the source said Jones was angry when the gold girl of the program acknowledged that her new contracts -- value to 1500 million pounds -- which means that she had no time to give her full attention to their furniture and to the Turuly.
The business is likened to the Giwynep brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and is supposed to double Willoughby's 11 million items.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby went to Instagram to announce that she would leave Toruly, Jones quickly left England to go to one of his homes.
A source of information or "I'm an hour, Truly is the top priority of Holly.
It's supposed to be her long-term future that's probably going to be with you for the next few decades.
Your decision to leave makes people very surprised.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, the time is very close to the release.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters ready to release."
Experts believe that the departure of this program, this Morning, one of the most relevant stars in England, can make the company pay millions of dollars by investing hard on products from buffers and candles to clothes and furniture, and the ability to back off time for product.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby’s mother and her husband had become close to Jones and Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly and Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as president in March.
The couples were on vacation together, and Jones had 40 percent of the shares in the New York Times.
Willoughby will become an ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin to become the leader of ITV, I'm A Celebrity.
A close source with Jones shared last night saying, "We're not going to comment on his business."
It's very close to each other.
He was joking about the criticisms he would get from the media because he gave a comment that some would consider "not to be the dominant form of authority" because he saw it as a better view of the Korean leader.
Why did the president give up so much?
He said in his voice, "The Program."
"I didn't give up."
He mentioned that Mr. Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June when Mr. Papping was a big step in atomicization in Korea.
But nuclear negotiations have been disrupted.
More than three months after the National Council of June in Singapore, the head of the United States of Korea spoke to world leaders at the U.S. General Assembly on Saturday that Korea did not see "finctive response" from the United States for the first armed action of North Korea.
Instead, he claimed that the United States is continuing its punishments to increase the pressure.
Mr. Zop had a more optimistic view of his speech at his campaign.
"We're doing great with Korea," he said.
"We're going to fight Korea.
Millions of people may be killed.
Now we're in this good relationship."
He said that the efforts to improve his relationship with Kim brought positive results -- ending the rocket trials, helping him to believe in freedom and bring the bones of the Americans home.
And he protected his unusual approach when he spoke about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to become president, but instead of 10,000 outsideers trying to put foot in this hard area, we have about 200 people standing right there," said Mr. Koppp, pointing to the crowd right in front of us.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia destroy the entire island and kill the dead.
For example, after the disaster from the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs say that they must not come.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population have been missing, there is no statement that the national disaster is given, a decision that is to work for international aid.
"I'm sorry, in many cases, they were very firm in not asking for international aid, so it was very challenging." Mrs. Sumbang shared.
While saving the Children is gathering a group to move to Palu, they're not sure if foreign employees can work in this area.
Sutèvre, a spokesman of the national disaster organization, says that the Indonesia officials are judging the situation in Palu to see if international institutions are allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Despite the constant earthquakes that Indonesia had to experience, the nation had not yet been well prepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunamis were built in Aceh, such places were not common in other locations.
Although the warning was effective, there was a lack of tsunamis in Palu that could lead to human damage.
At high times, moving between many of Indonesia’s islands was a challenge.
The natural disaster makes it even more complicated.
An ambulance saved in Lombok in order to cure the earthquake victims who were looking for a way to Palu, but it would take at least three days to get to where the disaster was just ahead.
President Joko Widodo has transformed Indonesia's old infrastructure into a center of his election campaign, and he has wasted his money on building the streets and the bars.
But the financial loss made it difficult for Joko’s government to face the election next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from the tensions of religions that have not ended in Indonesia, when the members of the majority of the Muslim pursue a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands were out of their homes when the Greco and Muslim gangs were swept across the street, using a knife, a bow, and other ancient weapons.

"I see Kante coming, so I'm working on a hit and I don't have a lot of fun."
Bones led almost half a fight after opening the count of the Belgium star, Eden Hazard at the 25th minute.
In this case, the army of the Royal Guard passed the ball to Mato Kovacic before moving around the middle of the yard and traveling to Liverpool field.
Kovacic had a piece of wall from the middle of the yard.

The Congress's Cromwell statue became the most new memory of history.
The removal would be as justice poems to the corrupting influence of many religious knights who followed him, when they destroyed the vast majority of the architecture and religion of England.
But the Crick Association describes Mr. Crick's words as "despiration" and "the force to rewriting history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Council, said: "It's not possible to avoid arguments about leaving the character Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster palace that will become the present center.
The symbol of civil war in Britain is not ordered by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell was wrong because of his father Thomas in the past century.
As representatives of Cromwell, Sir William Hamo Thasycret was a witness to the 19th century and part of the history of a person that many believe is still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith was considered to be a national guard against outside pressure, in his heart, perhaps in the end of the 19th century.
Even if it's a perfect example for the subject in the ongoing history debate.
It's certainly the 17th century conflict that shapes the next development of our country and Cromwell is a typical figure in division.
Your accomplishments as a defender of God are also worthy of honor and recognition."
The Prime Minister of China.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southern China market, according to local media news.
The man, known as "Yuan" was found dead with a broken arteries, the whole bloody at a cage in the Water House, the South Chinaing Post delivered the news on Sunday.
A pig peter prepares to inject a pig in a slaughterer on May 30, 2005 in West New Zealand, China.
He was supposed to move with his cousin from the province of Zhong Zhonghang on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found out he was dead, and he saw a door of a pighouse right next to the open door.
He said that in the cage was a big male pig with a blood trail around her.
The report of a medical examination confirmed that the pig weighed 550 pounds from the farmer to death.
"My brother's legs are bloody and not intact," their cousin was known for his name "Wu" according to his share on Guiyang Eveing News.
The pictures from the security camera showed that Mr. Yuan went to the market about 4,40 a.m. to feed the pig.
Then about an hour later, he was found dead.
The killer pig isn't a pig in the herd of two brothers.
A town manager shared with Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market manager are supposed to be dealing with the payments for his death.
Even if it is not common, the pig attacks the person who was previously noted.
In 2016 a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, causing her husband to get hurt.
Ten years ago, a six50 pounds of pig crushed a farmer of Wales into his drew machine until his wife threatened the running animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by a pig in 2012, a farmer Manitoba shared on CBC News that the pig was often not violent but blood could play a role as "breath."
"They just want to get close.
"They're curious, they're curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just need to love them properly," he said.
The edge of the Rosa storm brought great rain on the way to South America
Reportedly, the Rosa storm is failing as the route to the colder coast on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry rains all over northern Mexico and South America in the coming days.
Rosa had 85 mph wind, the First Air Force One, including 05:00 p.m. p.m. on Sunday morning, and was identified 385 miles south of the Southguta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rosa storm will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure begins to form on the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the West of the United States, and when Rosa approaches the Baja California island on Monday, it will start to take a lot of heat from the north to the west of the United States.
Rosa will bring a high amount of rain to 10 inches in Mexico's areas on Monday.
Then, low temperatures of humidity will cause a huge amount of rain in the south of the next days.
In the local, the amount of rain from one to four inches will cause dangerous scans, fragments, and even capacity in the desert.
The humidity will cause the amount of rain to reach two to three inches per hour at the points, especially in the South Nevada and Arizona areas.
It's a source of rain from two to four inches in the south, especially on the wide side of Arizona.
The scannings can happen as bad conditions go quickly because of the spreading of rain.
The situation would be extremely difficult if the risk of walking into the desert when there was a threat from the tropical rain.
The great rain can make the mountains strong, and the storm will carry the wind and the dust.
Low pressure will carry some big rains on the South California coast.
The total amount of rain can reach more than half inch, which can easily cause fragments and smooth roads.
This will be the first rain zone of rain.
Some tropical rains began to fall on Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain became more popular at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The great rain will reach Four Corners on Tuesday and extend to Wednesday.
Some extreme temperatures throughout the United States may be seen in October when the Arctic is colder, but the tropical area is still quite warm.
This sometimes leads to significant changes in temperatures in locals.
A typical example of significant temperature deterioration in the center of the United States on Sunday.
The temperature of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer warm and the court will be rebuilt and resuscitated.
Most of the central and eastern areas of the United States are predicted to have a warm start in October with a common temperature in about 80 areas in the South Plains to the north.
The temperature of New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, higher than about 10 degrees high.
The long weather report is showing the high temperature will be above the average temperature in eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people follow the hearing of Jochen Kavalaugh.
More than 20 million people have been watching the fifth hearing on six television systems of the Supreme Court's candidate Kavalaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack in 1980, Christine Blasy Ford.
Meanwhile, the political lock continued, with the TV stations that would interrupt the program frequently with the last minute of the crash on Friday: a deal was made by Senator Arizona Jeff Folke to run a copy of the charges a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee that she was pretty sure that Kavaugh was drunk and tried to remove her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a calm act, said he'd be 100% sure that it didn't happen.
It's possible that over 204 million people were watching the hearing, following Nielsen pointed out in the report on Friday.
The company counted the average viewer on the ABC, CBS, NBC, CN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data has not yet been covered with other television stations including PBS, C-N and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen has often had some problems calculating people in the office.
In order to establish a relationship, the number of audiences is similar to that of a final ticket game or Oscar prize.
Fox News, the director of the program, gave a powerful support to the appointment of Kavalaugh, led all the stations with an average rate of 5,69 million people during the hearing, Nielsen shared.
ABC stood second with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS with 3,1 million, NBC2 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CN is 2,52 million, Nielsen says.
The interest is still big after the hearing.
Folke is the central character in the noise Friday.
After the Republic's Republican character had just issued a statement that he was going to vote for Kavanaugh's support, he was followed by CN's camera and CBS on Friday morning that he was shouted when he tried to move the elevator to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes when he was questioned, live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the whole country?"
He was condemned, "You have power while too many women are in power."
Folke said before the elevator closed that his office made a statement, that he would have much to say at the committee's hearing.
All cables and television programs directly covered several hours later, when the Justice Committee would have to vote on Mr. Kavalnaugh was offered or not.
But Folke said that he would only do that when he learned that the FBI would examine the charges against the candidate next week, which some of the minor Republicans had urged.
Folke was convinced part of the conversation with his colleagues, Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and some senators later, Folke made his decision.
Folke's choice was heavy, because obviously the Republicans would not have a Kaval with no investigation.
President Zop opened an FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.

On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in the prison before trial last year, declared he'd be running in the European Senate election next year.
"Sure as an candidate for the European election is the best way to report back in democracy and oppression that we've seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Menga's fall brings victory 1-0 to Livingston before the crew.
Agnes Menga's previous lead has made Livingston sure the victory is won.
Livingston is on surprise for the Khans when this Ibrox field team is led by Steven Gerrard with only two losers in 18 games.
Greer Menga's desk proved the difference when Gary Holt's side improved with Hibernian in just a few seconds.
Gerrard's team has not yet won this season-of-the-circumference prize and faced the Hearts oil guide, leading to eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, the Providers welcomed Rampid Vienna in the Vandal League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended his series of unsatisfying games in six games, while the coach Horton's training has been tasteless since the replacement of Kenny Miler in the last month.
Livingston missed the chance to fight the guests below.
Tetch's team should have been leading before they wrote the table, with their direct strategy, caused the Khans to have a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson's tight but beyond the target, then Alan Lithgow can only direct his effort to get more powerful after leading the shadow to Craig Halkett over the bridge.
The owner of the house is confident that the Khans play in front of them, knowing that they can cause problems for the guests with personal techniques.
And that's a strategy for a fixed score.
The Providers gave a kick and Livingston that led ahead, Declan 12; and the 6,1102 to Menga, who had the ball and recorded the main point in the center of the bridge.
At this point, the Providers have won the power to keep the shadow, but they have found that the defenses can't get through and the head of the world, and it's almost no problem.
So the next round to the second round, even though Alfredo Morelos received help from Kelly.
Scott Pollyman has failed under the feet of the captain of the Castis Allegor and Lithgow, turning to a different play of Livingston.
The shadowings are constantly in the frame of Livingston and are constantly captured, when there are two temple penalty - after Halkett's challenge to the replacement of the & warnser, one because of the touch of the ball - they're all broken.
'The label' with Livingston - analysis
From Alasdair Lamont Scotland at Tony Macaroni Games
A result and a happy match for Livingston.
The team is brilliant, continued to reach the point of turning around in the line.
Their games and players have rarely changed since they've returned to their top position, but the remarkable situation has been for Timna because the way he's sharpened the ball since he showed up.
You have too many strong players.
Captain Halkett was the general, arranged an excellent defense, while Menga was constantly keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Worll.
But the Providers was lacking inspiration.
Like when they were under Gerrard's age, they did not achieve those standards.
The final defeat is the only chance that opens the front door of the host -- and it's a warning for the bats, the team of balloons in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a lot of embellies in Cengne.
There were nice smiles and weathers on Saturdays when the Turkish leaders and Germany met breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s debate to Germany - to repair relationships between the NATO allies.
They have discussed matters that include human rights, freedom of press, and Turkey to join EU.
Then Erdogan moved to Cengne to attend the dedication of a new Muslim church.
This city is the largest Turkeyn population outside Turkey.
The police led security reasons to stop the crowd from gathering in front of the Muslim church, but a lot of people were also there to meet their president.
Hundreds of protests against Erdogan - many of them were Kurds - also spoke up, condemned by Erdogan’s policy and decided that the German government would welcome him to this country.
The two extreme protests reflect the separation of a guest, as a hero of some Turkishs in Germany and are cursed by others as a authority.

The Rosa River is carrying the Phoenix, Las Vegas, the city of Salt Lake with the Great Flood.
It's very rare to lower the tropical pressure on Arizona, but that's exactly what can happen next week when the power powers of the Rosa storms are still in the south desert, pulling the scanning risks.
The National Air Forces have issued surveillance on Mondays and Tuesdays for the West Arizona to the South and the East of Nevada, South California and Utah, including the Phoenix cities, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake.
The Rosa's storm was expected to follow a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, but there was a rain on the second night.
The National Air Force Department in Phoenix mentioned in a brief news that only "a thousand tropical storms have formed the tropical storm or the tropical pressure in 200 miles [200 km] of the Phoenix in 1950!

The other areas of the West Sea are located in the central Rockies center and the Mediterranean can be overwhelmed by 1 to 2 inches, with a measure of separate floods that can reach up to 4 inches.
With the unrelenting regions, the rain from Rosa storms could be a good sign because the area is droughting.
Although flooding was a deep concern, some waterfalls could be happy to receive because the South East is experiencing drought.
According to the news from weather.com The U.S. C.R. C.A. C. C.E. says that there are only 40 percent of the Arizona area suffering the lowest drought, but it's still the second high in the same category.

Supply sharing that Kavanaugh ‘ has the selfish, angry' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavalaugh is a vote against the cruel and over-the-the-social tactics of the Democratic Party," said Mr. Kopp in a campaign at Wheling, West Virginia.
Mr. Kapp says Mr. Kavanaugh's selfishness, anger of the Democratic Party during his campaign.
Kavanauugh opposed to Congress on Thursday, denying a strong and decisive charge from Christine Blasey Ford that he had attacked her for decades before they were a teenager.
Ford also witnessed at the hearing of her charges.
The president said on Saturday, "The American people saw the beauty and dignity and courage of Kavalanugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavaugh is a vote to confirm that one of the worst legal minds in our day, a lawyer with a key to pure public service," he spoke to the crowd who supported West Virginia.
The president mentioned the details of the campaign of Ulrich Kavalaugh when talking about the importance of vote for the Republicans in the mid-term election.

Hundreds of deaths from the earthquake, tsunamis in Indonesia, increase.
At least 384 people were killed, many were carried away as the huge waves came down to the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami fell on the island of Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on a beach in Palu City on Friday when the waves reached six feet [18 feet] on the shore at sunset, and they killed many people and destroyed everything on their way.
The waves follow a seven and a half - degrees earthquake.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities on the beach and didn't leave immediately, and they became victims," said Suravier Purgo Nugroho, who spoke from the state's Anti-Pressor (BNPB), sharing in a news in Jakta.
"The tsunamis didn't make their own way, and it pulled down the car, the wood, the house, through everything on the land," said Mr. Nugroho, and added that the tsunami had gone through the open sea at 800 kph (497 km/ hour) before entering the coast.
Some climb up a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The images from above were not published by a disaster organization that showed that many buildings and stores were destroyed, and the bridges were broken and collapsed, and a Muslim church was overwhelmed in water.
The earthquakes continue to shake the city of the coast city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes has been seen in an area with 2,4 million people.
The U.S. and the Art of Indonesia (BPPT) stated that in the release of energy by a massive earthquake on Friday, about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb fell into Hiroshima City during World War II.
The location of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, according to the announcement.
Mr. Nugroho described the damage as "to big" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels fell.
The body of some victims was found trapped in the ruins of the buildings, where he reported, adding 540 wounded and 29 missing.
Nugroho says that the casualties and damage may not be stopped by going along the 300 km (190 km) coast north of Palu, a region called Donggala, where it is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
It's called "a completely paralyzed with no news" from Donggala, Mr. Nugroho said.
There are over 8,000 people living there" The Red Cross says in a statement, and it also says that their staff and volunteers are going to the areas that are affected.
"This was a tragedy, but tragedy could be much more frightening," they said.
This Saturday agency was widely condemned for not reporting that the tsunami came to Palu, although officials said that the wave had arrived over the period of warning was given.
In a non-expected video, social media shows that a man on high is screaming out for those who are on the way to the tsunami coming near.
A few minutes later, a water wall came to the shore, followed buildings and cars.
Reuters can't be confirmed by the video.
The earthquake and tsunamis caused a major loss of power to break out of contact around Palu made it difficult for the government to cooperate with their rescue efforts.
The authorities said that the military had begun to cut down the planes with the help of Jakharta and other cities, but the pioneers still needed food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has been opened to relief efforts and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will plan to visit the centers that have been evacuated at Palu on Sunday.
The real number of people in Indonesia are over 800.
The situation is bad.
While the members of the World Vision came from Donggala had arrived in the city of Palu, where the employees were building houses in the office yard, they had gone through the ruins of the streets, Mr. Dosba said.
"They told me that they saw lots of houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is bad.
Even when relief teams began significant movements when they started the disaster relief tool, some complain that foreign aid workers with high professionals were prevented from moving to Palu.
According to Indonesia’s rule, finance, private, and foreign aid can only begin if the location of the disaster is declared as a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster," said Austia Arriani, who spoke of the Indonesia Red Cross.
" once the government decides, "Yes, this is a national disaster," we can be ready for international support but no speech."
When the second night falls on Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of those who are still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be a miracle to combine the dark stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled up from the pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman trapped under a heap of ruins for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, who had trained two of the players who had been missing for the Asian Games, was first held in Indonesia.
Others were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Brother Mandagi, his students.
"It was an old man in the field of spite, and I carried the burden of my own emotions," he said.
Gendon relates, in a few hours after news of the fall of the Roa Roa Roa spread in the community, he was desperate to text the enemies at Palu, who were attending the beach.
His message, however, had only one gray volume instead of two blue.
"I think that means the messages were not sent," he said.

Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He wrote in a notice of the change on Twitter on Saturday: "Before that everybody knows about me, Kye West."
West, 41 years old, has named the artist Ye for a while and used this name as the eighth album being released in June.
The change happened before you showed up on Saturday Night Live, when you were expected to release a new album of Yandhi.
You're the guest of the program for Dr Ariana Grande when you say you're an emotional disorder, the creator of the program says.
As noted in the modern - day art of art, West once said that this word was religious to him.
"I believe "ye" is the most popular word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "friend," "you," "the first time this year, when talking about your album title with Big Boy.
"I'm friends, I'm us, we are.
The transition from Kanye, which means only, in Ye - the reflection of the good, the bad, the return, everything.
Album is more than our own reflection.
You're one of the famous renamepers.
Sean Hobbes is well known for the name Puff Daddy, P.D. Maddy or Maddy, but this year you said you're targeting Love and Brother Love.
An artist who used to cooperate with West, JAY-Z, is also wondering whether there is or no dashing and writing flowers.
The President of Mexico claims he won't lead an army against the civilians.
The president of Andreshark Obrund has declared that he will never use military forces against civilians when this country reaches the anniversary of 50 years of the bloody revenge against the student.
Lopez Obrande committed on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square, "Never give the Mexican army an army."
The military fired in a peace protest on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at that time when the left-hand movement was taking root throughout Latin America.
Lecter Obrunds has sworn to support the young Mexican boys by granting monthly services to students and by opening free public colleges.
He explained that the issue of career and lack of educational opportunities led young people to get involved in bad things.
The United States should double the A.I.
When China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money for research in this field, investor and career on AI Kai-Fu Lee, who used to work for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The ideas presented after different parts of the U.S. government issued a statement about AI, even while the entire United States is in no official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced his plan last year: the goal of becoming a member of the country of AI to the year 2030.
"Dead twice the AI research budget will be a positive beginning, because all the other countries are down behind the United States very far, and we're looking for the next break in AI," said Lee.
Double the risk can double the chance that the next great AI will be done in the United States, Lee shared with CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book "Investigative Wisdom: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, director of Sinotivetures, invested in one of the most outstanding AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he was working at an AI system that beat the Bible players in the United States with the highest class, and he was then the director at Microsoft Research and the Google branch director in China.
Lee approached the former technology competitions of the United States government as a test of the E.R.A.'s robotics project and took care of when the next contest would happen, to help determine the next view.
Researchers in the United States often work hard to obtain government aid, Lee.
"Not China is asking for all the scholars to go first; but it's all groups," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired bright stars from colleges to work about AI in recent years.
Lee shared the changes in the immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen their AI efforts.
He added: "I think the green card should be automatically given to doctors about AI."
The U.S. Senate has issued the next generation intelligence development plan in July.
Lee adds: The National Sciences of China provide aid to those of the same art organizations as the Society and other government organizations that provide money for U.S. researchers, but the quality of research in China is lower.
Early this year in the United States of Office has established a Master's Center of Human Rights, in order to intervene with partners from industry and education, and the White House has established the Human Rights Committee.
In this month the C.E.'s headquarters of the E.A.R. Project has declared 2 billion dollars for a project called AI Next.
At the National Science Foundation, they now invest more than 100 million dollars a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, the law of the United States has been looking for a National Security Council on human intelligence, but it has not been seen for months.
The people of Macedonia voted in a national ceremony for the change of their country's name
The people of Macedonia had voted on Sunday's appeal to change their names to North Macedonia, or not, this was a campaign that lasted decades with Greece in order to stop the entry into the European Union and the NATO.
Greece, there was a province called Macedonia, claiming that the name of the northern neighbors corresponds to their own territory and has ruled over the participation of the NATO and EU.
The two governments signed a deal in June based on the new name, but the protesters claimed that this change would weaken the race of the majority of the population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov declared that he would not vote in the bridge and a food cleansing operation had become suspicious of whether the election would meet at least 50 percent for the legal requirements of the public demand.
The question in the vote represents the idea of "Do you agree to be members of the NATO and EU with the approval of the Greek agreement?"
Those who support their names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, think that it's a price to pursue an organization like EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that rise from the fall of Thailand.
Oliveraharijevka, 79 years old, in Skopje, says: "I'm here to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so they can freely enjoy the protection of the European Union because that leads to our lives better for all of us."
Although members of the Congress were not legally bound, they said they would submit to the votes to make decisions.
Changing names will take two thirds of the Congress's votes.
The national election said no reports of anomaly until 1 p.m.
However, the vote rate only reached 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the election last year when 66 percent of the votes were registered.
Tri Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old at Skopje, says: "I vote for my children, because our position is in Europe."
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, and Dashko’s son, had voted in a civil convention in Macedonia about changing their national name, which would open the way for the joining of NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 1818.
Before the convention in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, age 54, was preparing a small platform and pulled the chair before the tent that was built by people who were going to wipe out the people's wishes.
Kavarkov says, "We support NATO and EU, but we want to join the main road, not through the back door."
"We're a poor country, but poor.
If they don't consider us Macedonia, then we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Asian link."
Prime Minister Zaev says that as a member of the NATO member, there's very high-ranking investments for Macedonia, where there's more than 20 percent of the income rate.
"I believe most will agree because over 80 percent of our citizens support EU and NATO," said Mr. Zaev after the vote.
He shared that a yes would be a "circumference for our future."
A survey published on Mondays last week by the Macedonia Law Research Institute stated that about 30 to 43 percent of the votes were going to be involved in a campaign request - less than the vote.
Another survey, which was performed by the Telma TV of Macedonia, said that 57 percent of people were asked to vote on Sunday.
Among them, 70 percent said they made a vote.
A successful civil convention must be a vote rate of 50 percent and a vote.
The failure in the national request shows that the first major blow against the state of the West government has been fought since last May.
Monitors: have you entered the whole room to record the table in Manchester City?
"Endro and Rahem Sterling broke the line of defenses with Manchester City's 2-0th Saturday at the Etithad stadium in Manchester, England."

Scherzer wants to burn himself up against Rockies.
With the Nationals removed from the final ticket competition, there's no reason to start over.
But a Scherzer who hopes to win the stage on Sunday with Colorado Rockies, but this only makes sense when it's still a ring for Rockies, a team leading to a battle with Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies earned at least one special performance with five-2 before Nationals on Friday night, but still trying to make sure the front of the board.
"Even though playing is meaningless, at least we've been thrown into the ball when we learned about the atmosphere in the “airs ” with the crowd and the others are going to play with any of the highest places I can fight this year.
Why don't I want to fight in a fight like that?
Nationals hasn't published the player in the Sunday game, but Scherzer's going to be given a ball in this situation.
Scherzer, who blows his 34th start, will have a game of football on Thursday and the game on your Sunday day.

Corp's movement in West Virginia
The president mentioned details about the situation around his Supreme Court, chose to select out Kavalaugh when he spoke about the importance of vote for the Republicans in the mid-term election.
"All we do is have potential in November.
Only five weeks left to one of the most important elections in life.
This is one of the big, big things -- not running, but running is the reason I'm going all over the place to fight for the light candidates." He shared it.
"You're going to see the negative and negative democracy now exists.
And they're determined to suppress their power by using any trick, and then you'll see selfishness, trick.
They don't care who's hurt, who's gonna have to step on to gain power and control, they just want power and control, and we won't give them that."
He added, "The democracy is trying to "discreet and block."
"You've seen it in the last four days." He added, and said, "You're saying, "The Democratic Party's getting angry and selfish and tricky and lies."
He pointed out that the Senate Committee recognized Senator Dianne Feinstein, which had stumbled from below.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the information go?
What?
No, no, I'm not, I'm looking forward to -- it's an incredible form of body language -- it's the least kind of body language I've ever seen.
The Social Party is no longer an open party.
The idea is that something is unacceptable.
I'm not surprised that Momentum's activists, in my local party, votes to test me.
Finally, I'm the latest in a series of International Congressmen who are informed that I'm not welcome - because I've made an opinion.
As a member of the Congress with me, Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was determined to support the opposition.
In my case, the drilling action was on me because I did not share my opinion with Jeremy Corbyn.
As to the importance of a national security policy, in Europe, the same irony problems that Jeremy did not agree with the former leaders.
Noticeing the Nottingham East Festival on Friday says, "We want our meetings to be involved and effective."
For almost eight years as a senator for the local International Service Meeting, the six - evening Governing Body meetings all occur in such a way.
Sadly, today, it's not the tone in many meetings and political promises of "super, gentle" that has been forgotten for a long time and is really whether it's ever started."
More and more clearly that different views are not tolerated in the Times and that every opinion is judged by whether or not the chiefs of the party will be accepted.
This started right after Jeremy became the leader, because my former colleagues thought that the political views with me were starting to expect me to change my mind and take my position that I would never accept -- whether of the national security or the EU market.
Any time I make a public statement -- and actually, whatever I say -- take advantage of the social media call out, the political charges, tell me that I shouldn't be in the party.
And not only do I feel that way.
In fact, I know I'm much more fortunate than some of my colleagues because comments that point to me have a political tendency.
I was surprised by the professional and conscientiousness of my colleagues, who faced the flow of sexual abuse or racial differences every day but never avoided.
One of the most sad aspects in this political age is that the amount of abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn announced the last week that the Group should be able to build the drill culture.
In fact, we're no longer that open-up party and with all the "untrustless" action or the change of choice, the party has become narrow.
I've had a lot of advice in the past two years about encouraging me to stay calm, don't take too many words and then I'm gonna "go."
But I'm not in politics.
Since I've been at the studio for 32 years before I was just a boy, I've been motivated by the confusion of the government that brought my entire school down literally, I've tried to bring better public services to those who need them-- either local or government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be mistaken about the policy positions and my differences with the current leader.
For those who have motivated their actions on Friday, all I want to share is that when the land of their surroundings in Brexit, it's going to hurt our families, our business, and our public services, I don't want to waste my time and energy on loyalty to the International Party.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr failure to lead
The next two tries may have made the final mistake, but no doubt, Ayr deserves victory in the Tennent Premiership Games.
Now they're in the front of the table, the only royal throne in the ten.
Well, it's also their super-class defense, as well as their better chance, to bear the owner's name and coach Peter Murchie is fully satisfied.
He said, "To this day, we have walked through our games to this hour and we still fail, so I'm satisfied."
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ghi accepted for Ayr, they caught better opportunities than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th table, which was written by Frezier Climo, gave Ayr to first, but, a gold card for the Scotland Rory Hughes, opened the game for Warrs, allowed Melrose to display his hands and Jason Baggott to give a ball to the team.
Climo had reached the front of Ayr with a temple, before, in the first round, he had the next score written by an extra piece of solo to raise the number to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose was starting to gather the two best ways, and Patrick Anderson made it, Baggot added points, cut the billions down to five points.
After a long time of serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had been down, and since his re-started, Ayr led to a climax by Stafford McDowall, Climo added points.
Captain Ayr, Mr. Macphson, then struck with a gold card, and again, Melrose made the player head by a non-disputed desk of Bruce Colvine, before a stress pressure.
Still, the host came back, and when Struan Hutchonson was struck with gold because against Climo without the ball, from the temple line, MacPhson put a mark on the side of the Ayr team.
Climo added his point, as he did almost since his arrival, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's ball and passed to the player Gregor Henry's second score of the host's fifth score.
The Stung Game Star is about to get into the restaurant business.
Sun Game's star, Ford Kernan is about to move to the hotel after knowing that he's considered the director of a company that's authorized.

‘ The sea is ours: the nation that doesn't have Bolivian hoped that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol a Navy station equipped in La Paz.
Public buildings all hang the blue flag.
The Navy bases from Lake Titicac to Amazon were drawn with a title: "This is our right.
The sea again is our mission."
Every corner of Bolivia, the memory of a beach was lost into Chile's hand in the 19th century's bloody resource conflict -- as well as the desire to row out to the Pacific again.
Those hopes were probably the most burning of decades, since Bolivia was waiting for the judgment of the World Justice Court on October 1st, after five years of consideration.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian foreigner, says: "Bolivia has motivation, spirit of unity and calm, and of course, expecting in a positive view of the result."
Many Bolivians will follow ICJ’s judgment on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Haguue will support Bolivia’s declarations, that - after decades of stress- Chile is a duty to negotiate to Bolivia for a way to reach the sea.
Evoravin, a convincing root of Bolivia, faced a severe debate to re-run the next year -- there were many cards in the second day's judgment.
At the end of August, he was determined: "We are about to return to the Pacific Sea."
But some analysts claim that the court is not capable of making decisions about Bolivia - and that this is less likely to change.
The United States with the Netherlands has no right to give the territory to Chile and has determined that they will not determine the outcome of potential exchanges.
ICJ's decision was given just six months after the final debate was given to show that the situation was not complicated, Mrs. Paz Zárate, an expert on Chile's international law.
And further than Bolivia's complaint, it's been four years back.
Zárate said, "The approach to the sea has been attacked by the current Bolivian government."
She added, Mr. Harriet's bold statement has turned off all the rest of Chile's goods.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to discuss each other, but it will be extremely difficult to organize later discussions.
Two countries have not traded ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguz Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia at The Hargue, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was very quick.
The second will give Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new era with a relationship with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of conflict, he shared.
Calzadilla also denied that Ramsay -- still one of the most famous presidents in Latin America -- is using sealiness as a political lifesaver.
Bolivia adds: "Bolivia will never abandon access to the Pacific."
"the judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to go through the past."
Korea says there will never be a solution to nuclear weapons unless they can trust the United States.
The secretary of the North Korean Rong Ho revealed that his country would never be free of nuclear weapons unless they could trust Washington before.
Mr. Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations Council.
He asked the United States to fulfill the promises at the convention in Singapore between the two - side leaders.
He pointed out that when the American Secretary Mike Pompo seemed to be on his way to re-start the nuclear trade policy for over three months after the meeting in Singapore with the Korean Leader Kim Jong Un.
Mr. Ri said that it was a dream when he continued the treatment and protests of the United States for the end of the Korean War to bring Korea back to defeat.
Washington is carefully agreeing with the statement that there is no Pingromatic action to be taken out of the first weapon.
Both Mr. Kim and President of the United States are looking forward to a double meeting.
But there's no small doubt that PFP is very serious about abandoning an armory that this country can view as the only way to secure security.
Puppeo is planning for the next month's visit to prepare for the First-Trump convention.
The most recent line of large hats is about to cover all the big streets near you.
If you want to add a collection of hats or completely avoid the sun, you don't have to look far away.
The original author of Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of other amazing first - century designs in their SS1 collection on the ice would cause the design style at the Paris Times.
The high-actionless hats have already searched Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their eyes on the floor.
Gaffio's highlight is a color hat that is so wide that it's attached to furlike ones, covered on the head of the model.
Other cases of too much suffering include abstinence, witch hats, and even an ass -- but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also reveals a series of weird masks -- just in time for the Halloween occasion.
A lot of symmetric masks have been sullied in the same way as the high-level fashion.
A design like a complete sea diving device with a ventilator and a lens, and another device looks like a melt-up ice cream.
And if you continue to catch a huge fashion -- you're lucky.
The graver predicts that big ears may be about to cover all the big streets near you.
Big hats became hot on their heels, ‘La bombba', a wide hat that was used by Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
It's an extremely unusual sign of affection behind the very fact that all of the social media has brought to another great creation on the floor -- a large beach bag of beaches close to the shower suit.
The bag of ffia orange oranges, which is made up of ffia with the upper hand in white, is an outstanding piece in the Gorgeera SS1 collection of Jacquemus at the Paris fashion.
The famous model maker Luke Armitage said to the FE: ‘ I hope to see the hats and bags of large seaboards growing up on the big streets in the next summer - because the designer has created such a big impact that it can hardly overlook the needs of the great ones.'
The foreign skills are essential for global citizens.
The private schools in Scotland maintain their outstanding learning skills, which was carried on in 2018 with a series of remarkable learning results, strengthened by both individual and collective in sports, art, music, and community activities.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, they're supported by the Swiss Council of Scotland, trying to bring the best services to students and parents.
The independent schools tend to equip deep and wide, as well as your career and position as global citizens.
As a educational distribution that can design and run the school's powerful teaching program, we see modern languages continue to be a popular and chosen subject in schools.
“ If you talk to someone in his language, he understands, what says is going to go into his mind.
If you talk to him in his own language, what says will go into his feelings."
This is a convincing message that we not only rely on the English when we expect to establish a relationship and trust with people from other countries.
From recent exams in recent years, we can see that foreign languages are taking the lead in the classrooms with the peaks through the most experienced private school.
All 68 percent of foreign students get higher points A.
The data collected from 74 percent of SUS's members showed that 72 percent of students reached the point A in Chinese, besides 72 percent learned German, 69 percent learned French and 63 percent of Spanish as well.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are in a direction to view foreign languages as essential skills that children and teenagers will not be able to have in the future.
Their own language learnings are being viewed as the principals of STEM, technology, technology, and mathematics in private schools as well as elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Health and Health Council in 2014 showed that in the reasons for the difficulty of finding people, there was a lack of foreign skills.
As a result, language skills become more practical to equip young people into future careers.
With as many opportunities as the need for a foreign career, these skills become practical in a world that is increasingly flat.
No matter how people choose to work, if they learn a second foreign language, they will have a real advantage in the future when they have such a full - time skill.
It is possible to communicate directly with the native language, which is clearly leading all trials.
According to one survey of youGov over 40,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to perform a simple paragraph in another language, and only French is the only language that has the ratio to a number of units, 15 percent.
That is why investing in a foreign teaching is vital for children today.
It's in a variety of languages, especially the languages of developing economics, which will equip children with better potential in finding a real job.
In Scotland each school taught different languages.
Some schools will focus on more modern languages, while others will teach foreign languages that are considered important to Britain in view of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever it is, there is also a variety of languages to choose from within the middle of private schools, along with that of a trained teacher.
The private schools in Scotland focus on providing an environment of preparation and provisions for children that are vital for success, no matter what the future is.
Can't deny that, in an international business environment, the language will continue to be a very important factor in the future of the country, which should be widely used in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "the international communication skills."
The private schools will continue to offer this opportunity to young Scotlands: variety and export them.
There can't be another option.

TTACORD IN West Virginia, YouTube Channel
Tonight, at Wheling, West Virginia, President Donald Petrop began campaigning.
This is the first stop on the fiveth journey of TT. Dyp for the next week, including stopping in the state of support like Tennessee and Mississippi.
The candidate's vote for the candidate you're asking for is in an empty room of the Supreme Court, and President Zop is trying to win the favor before the election is coming, when the Republicans are facing the risk of losing control of the Congress when the election begins in November.
Where did you start at West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
TT.D.'s campaign in the city of Wheling, West Virginia, was expected to start tonight at 7:00 p.m. on the east, Saturday, September 29th, 2018.
You can track the TT.Lap in West Virginia is broadcast directly on YouTube.
President Zop may be referring to the hearing this week by Javier Kavalaugh - the Supreme Court judge -- who is now facing sexual attacks and the court's vote has to be re-expected for a week to get the FBI to investigate.
However, the main purpose of these ongoing campaigns was for the opponent to draw support for the Republican candidates before the election in November.
So, according to Reuters, the goal of campaigning through the next 05 campaign next week to "to strengthen the volunteers and the Republicans in the defense race and to extend the majority of the votes they have in the Senate and the Senate."
"The Congress control is important in the program, so the president will visit the most states before he enters the busy election season," said a speaker of TT.M. who wants to be hidden from Reuters.
It's happening at the Wyroco, the city of Wheling, tonight's campaign can attract those who support the word "Oho and Pennsylvania, and also attract the radio to the news," the West Virginia Metro News radio.
Saturday is going to be the second visit of TTP, the last month to West Virginia, the state that he won 40 percent from 2016.
TT. Papp is trying to support Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for Senator of West Virginia, which is now in the polls.
According to Reuters, as a guide to Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University: "The president's going to have to visit the state to fight the vote for the candidate's vote is not a good sign with Morrisey."
The U.S. team was determined to fight in single combat on Sunday.
After three unsatisfying fights, the fight on Saturday afternoon could be a necessary thing for the Ryder.
Pressing the wrists in a vibrating way is a completely new exercise concept, but it's also the effect that athletes really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So where's the current engine?
"They've led by six points, they're only four, and I think it's our motivation," said Jordan Nichoth, who shared it when he walked.
Of course, the European team has an advantage, leading to four points, and they have 12 more games.
As U.S. recruits say, there's still a little bit of hope and they're very encouraged, especially with quilts and Justin Thomas.
Neanderth was an old golfer in the release of the ball to the golf hole, and he always took the lead in the mirror.
The shouts were so loud as they came to his circle, especially the trick to break the fight when he and Thomas beat the ball into the golf hole.
It's the same thing that the 15th game is, which means you're completely confident in the opposite line of the U.S. team.
"You have to think very carefully and worry about your own fight."
All athletes have left.
There's 18 holes left to score.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a myth that can't be denied by Uther Ryder, is the only couple that's got a higher score than Ryder and Thomas.
This strange, hysterical couple of European recruits had won 4:0 and couldn't make a mistake.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who don't fight bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoid bingey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and nine holes after Friday.
That victory and the energy from them spread to the mob of warm mobs, making people feel that they are the enemies who need to beat on Sunday; and there's no more golf worth more than Fleetwood or Molinari to protect the victory of the European team at sundown on Le Golf National.
I hope both of you at the same time appear in different golf holes.
Even so, it's too early to confirm the triumph of the European recruit.
Denis Watson and Webbeth were defeated by the hero of a series of fourballs in the morning, when they fought with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double in the first nine holes has caused Spanish and Sweden to lose their opportunity to fight.
On Sunday, I'm afraid no one can pull them out of that failure.
The nighttime games and foursome games are most likely to be considered because of the interaction between the two, their advice and the game strategy changes only in the rule.
The European recruits were better on the team, and they were pretty far ahead of the final battle, but this series of foursome shows that the American team still had a chance to win.
The European recruit team led 10-6 before the final day of the Ryder Games.
The European Ryder team will take advantage of the final match after the wonderful series of fourballs, leading to U.S. 106.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead this advantage by two Tiger Woods winnings for four more points on Le Golf National.
Thomas have been on the European team, with the determination to get back to your team in the last two years, to win over America in the morning fourball, leading to 3-1.
The U.S. team fights better in a series of days, winning two games, but they can't win the final.
Jim Hardyk's team needs eight points in a series of Japanese competitions to get back to jail.
Fleetwood was the first European golf player to win four points when you and Molinari, often called the "Molliwood" couple, was the second couple after the romantic contests had won four points in the four opening games in the history of the Ryder.
After the Woods and Patrick Reed in the battle, they have a much more convincing victory than Woods and the American Bryson Dechambeau with point 54.
Woods fought two fights on Saturday and sometimes there were moments of light, but so far, he lost 19/29 games in a series of fourballs and foursome, where there were seven more matches.
Justin Rose, after taking a break in the morning row, came back with havenson in the war, beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, two golfers in order 1 and 3 in the world, with 2=1.
However, although the weather in the south of Paris was very pleasant, the European recruits did not have an easy day to fight.
The player once won three times Jordan Basilth and Justin Thomas put a major strain on the U.S. team with two points on Saturday.
They won the victory to convince you two:1 before the Spanish golfer, Jon Rahm and Ian Drewer in front of the war, and then continue to defeat Drewer and Rory McIlroy with point 4&3 in the war, although they missed the first two holes.
In the history of Ryder, there are only two times a team led by four points that can start single fights, though, the Furyk team just needs to hold on to it.
After only a second stand in two days, Sunday is likely to be a back-up for this team.
North Korea claims 'no way' to solve the same as lack of faith.
The President of North Korea spoke before the United Nations on Saturday, claiming that the punishments are still being maintained and that their doubts for America and in this situation, there's no way this country is ever going to abandon nuclear weapons.
Mr. Rong Ho has been speaking during the annual meeting of the United Nations Council, saying that North Korea has performed a number of nuclear and nuclear experiments over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and rockets, removing nuclear experiments and commitments.
"Of course, we don't see the same behavior from the United States," he said.
"If we can't trust the United States, we won't be able to be confident of national security, and in such a situation, we're not going to be able to solve ourselves first."
Although Mr. Ri repeated the familiar statement of Korea about Washington to deny the release of nuclear weapons "in each period" and the North Korea would have the same benefit in taking each step, his statement had a remarkable point that would not be denied to the former nuclear solution.
Mr. Ri referred to a general statement by Kim Jong Un and Mr. Donald Papp at the first peak of an American president and a Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in this statement, Mr. Kim pledged his effort to enter the nuclear weapon on the Korean Ocean, while Mr. Pip promised to secure Korea.
She's still trying to find an official way to end the Korean war in 1950-72, but the United States insists that P.N. has to abandon nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposed the call to disseminate international punishments against the Great War.
"Resurrection of the first nuclear weapon" and increase the pressure of the discipline to achieve its purpose, even against the end of the war," said Mr. R. R.
"The point that our talent of punishment can make us kneel down on our knees is that the dream of those who don't understand us.
But the problem here is that the punishments are still on this side continue to lose our trust."
Mr. Ri did not mention the plan for the second peak convention between President Kim and President of the United States as the head of the United States at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister mentioned three encounters between President Kim and President of Korea of the past five months and added: "If the U.S.S. is dealing with a nuclear solution to the nuclear weapons of Korea, not the United States, then the Korean atomic negotiation won't fall into the ring like this now."
Yet, Mr. Ri's tone was different than last year, when he spoke before the Council that the Korean launch into the American continent was impossible to avoid in a suicide mission after the "Spire" is called Mr. Kim's name "the rocket."
Last year in the United Nations, Mr. Papp threatened to "solve" Korea, but this year's end of his praise to Kim for taking the steps to win the armor, but he also stressed that there was a lot of work to do and that the disciplines were kept until Korea was released from nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, TT. Kip said that he didn't set his time for this: "two years, three years or only five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Council should be commended for their efforts.
However, the U.S. Secretary Mike Pompoe on Thursday said to the United Nations Security Council: "The punishments of the Security Council must continue to be done strongly and unsatisfying until we can confirm the complete atomic outcome, ultimately, with proof."
The Security Council has agreed to enhance the treatment of Korea since 2006 to prevent the supply of relief for nuclear and nuclear missiles programs.
Secretary Puppeo had a foreign talk on the other side of the official meetings of the United Nations Council and said he'd be going to visit Pharmopo again in the next month to prepare for the second peak.
Mr. Pompo has visited Korea for three times this year, but the final outcome is not very good.
He left Ping after the visit in July and said that the negotiation had certain progress, but only a few hours later, North Korea accused the minister of "the same request as the black society."
She insisted on attending the meeting with President of Korea, the Moon Jae-In in this month to remove a rocket test base and a nuclear combination if the United States has a similar "the same situation."
He said that President Kim directed that "the similar situation" that he was looking for is the security guarantee that Kop was committed in the Singapore conference and went to normalize with Washington.
Harvard students are in full rest course.
In an effort to fight the culture of mechanical pressure, with 'Missicer Night' drinking coffee instead of water, a new course at Harvard University this year has encouraged all students to sleep more.
The students at the university of some of these worlds often don't know the basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medical science at Harvard University, was also an expert at the Women's Hospital and Bryceham who designed this course and he himself believed that this was the first class of this kind in America.
The inspiration of this course came after he attended a conversation about the impact of lack of sleep on the learning process.
'After the end of the conversation, a student came to me and said, 'Why did you know this until the last year?'
She said no one told her about the importance of sleep, which really surprised me, he shared with The Netgraph.
The course of this year was first introduced, explaining to the students the importance of good sleeping habits that helped to improve their learning and sports results and to improve their overall health.
Paul Barreira, a mental professor at the University of Y Harvard and director of medical services at the university, said that the school decided to introduce this course after finding the students who had a serious sleep during the week.
The course lasted a period of interactive tasks.
In a part of the picture of the schoolroom, the students can click on a cup of coffee, curtains, training machines, and books to learn about the effects of carffine, light, light, and lack of sleep affects the outcome of sports, as well as the importance of shapeing habits on time.
In another part, those who are involved find out how long a state of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map to the university, with interactive symbols, encouraged the participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know that this course cannot immediately change students' behavior.
But we believe that they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know for your health when you choose to smoke cigarettes, Professor Czeisler added.
He said, "I'm still in the middle of the night," and modern technologies and pressure are growing to students that lead to a state of sleep is a serious problem.
Make sure enough sleep, the quality of sleep, should become the secret air of students to fight stress, stress, and anxiety -- even to avoid increasing weight, because lack of sleep causes the brain to fall into hunger, which leads to our constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California was studying biology, chemistry, and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design this course, and he also joined one of the last year's classes in Harvard.
He said that the course helped him to ‘ keep his eyes open ’ and inspired him to try to get him to hold a course in the entire school.
He hoped that the next step would be to offer all of the students' studies after college to attend a similar program before starting to compete in the main course.
Professor Czeisler urged the students to consider when setting up your time of sleep, time to wake up, and need to be aware of the damage of the blue light' coming out of the video screen and the light, which could cause your biodiversity, which could lead to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Examples: Menga brings down Gerard's boys.
The dæmons had a day of unsatisfying competition when Greer Menga's reflections failed Steven Gerrard's team to the 1-0-0s before Livingston.
Ibrox's host is hoping to mark the first victory since the 4-1 won at St Johnstone's airport in February, but Gary Holt's team has caused the second loss of Gerrard in 18 games as a coach, pulling about eight points from the head of the Ladrokes Premiersip Hearts.
Menga remained in control of seven minutes before the end of the round one, but the atmosphere of the bats seemed to have never been crushed.
The crew has now fallen to the sixth position while Livingston has climbed to third position and only after Hibernian on the wrong side of the table.
And the Providers had to deal with another problem after the issue of Calum Spence had to treat the wound in the head after there was a clear object that was thrown from the front of the guest yard.
Gerrard changed the team eight times compared to the team who passed Ayr to sell Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Tetri maintained Lavi 11 and won a spot before the Hearts team last week, and he must have been very happy with how his students were surrounded by enemies during each attack.
Although the dæmons have more ballies, Livingston is the real team that is dangerous to have a ball.
They should have written a table only two minutes after Menga first put Scott Pitman in the yard, attacked Allan McGregor's city frame, but the guard missed this opportunity.
A deep shot of Keaghan Jacobs took the ball to the foot of Captain Craig Halkett, but the security of Alan Lithgow can only give the ball to the back of the frame.
The dæmons have control over the field, but their way of playing is primarily based on hope rather than faith, especially in the last 1/3 time of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he had to get the penalty on the temple because he and Steven Lawless had been hit, but by Stephen Thomson's skill, Steven Thomson rejected the appeal of this Colombian player.
The bats had only two hit the frame in the first round, but former Ibrox at Ibrox Kelly Kelly Kelly was barely in trouble with Lassana Coulbaly's first hit and Ovie Ejaria's reaction.
Although Lavi's opening the figure at the 34th minute was considered an advantage, no one could deny that their victory was totally worth it.
Once again, the Khans can't handle Jacobs' deep-ass pitching.
Scott Arfield didn't have time to react when Declan Gallaghers him, and Scott was calm to choose Menga to make a simple end.
Gerrard immediately had a plan during his vacation, by replacing Coulbaly with Ryan Kent, and this replacement almost immediately led to his immediate impact when the player ran this wing to give Morelos a ball, but Kelly was impressed when he immediately stopped the ball.
But Livingston was successful in dragging the guests to follow the right course they wanted, when Lithow and Halkett were constantly making long-term passs.
Holt's team had a chance to get ahead in the final minutes of the game, but unfortunately, McGregor chose the right position to stop Jacobs before Lithow hit the corner.
The new player enters the Providers Middleton airport after contact with Jacobs, but once again he was rejected by Thomson.
Manager: The founder of the Geiger count
A page from the Sunday Yearbook: September 30, 182, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a radiation detection method, invented the foundation for a device called the Geiger Count.
Since then, the Geiger count has become not only a scientific pillar, but also a pillar of their culture. For example, this is a conversation in the "Bells of Coronado," in 1950, with the participation of scientists and High President Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger count, used to locate radiation, such as uranium.
When you put your ears on, you can actually hear the effects of radiation atoms in the minerals."
Evans: "Yes, there's a sound this way!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.
However, the invention of your name remains with time.
The new cancer request can teach the immune system how the cell's broken.
The new cancer request can teach the immune system how the cell's broken and destroyed them.
Please teach your immune system how to identify broken cells in the process.
This approach includes taking immune cells from the patient, changing the cell in the lab.
Then these cells can't see'the common protein in many cancers and be injected into the body.
A test vaccine is giving better results in different patients with different cancers.
A woman who was treated with vaccines taught the immune system to recognize the broken cells and her egg cancer cells disappeared for over 18 months.
This approach includes taking immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the lab, so that these cells can "see" the common protein in many cancers, called HER2, then respirating into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Library, Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our research shows that we're in the hands of a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "to push the development of some cancers," including breast cancer, eggs, lungs, and lungs, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar study method, taking immune cells from the patient's body, and they're going to target cancer, which has worked in the process of treating a white blood disease.
Kanye got a lot of ice when he showed mad support to the TTGA hat, the US Great Again.
Things don't work.
Kanye West took a lot of noise in the studio during the SNL music night, after his campaign, during the show, he praised the President of the United States and claimed he was running for 2020.
After the third song was finished, Ghost Town, still wearing the Make America Great Again hat, he was angry with the Democratic Party and claimed to support TT.

HlV/ Anyds: China reports the number of new infections to 14%
China has just announced the number of citizens living with HlV and Aids have increased 14 percent.
Health officials say that the country has over 8200,000 people with this disease.
In the second year of 2018 alone, the number of infections is said to be 400,000.
The vast majority of new infections are caused by sexual infection, which is a huge change in the way they used to.
Over the years, HlV spread rapidly in some parts of China is caused by blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who are infected with HlV on this road has dropped almost zero. This is a statement by Chinese health officials at a convention in the province of Vietnam.
However, the number of people living with HlV and Ireland in China has increased to 100,000 people each year.
It's a serious problem going on in the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality is no longer considered illegal in China since 1997, there has been a very popular behavior with the LGBT community.
By the traditional values of this country, study estimates 70-90 percent of men eventually married, even though they have developed sexual relations with men.
Many people have been infected with chronic illness for centuries because they did not take full measures to protect their sexual relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been committed to grant HlV treatment to all patients who are infected to deal with this disease.
Mrs. Maxine Waters denied that her staff revealed the data of the Republican senators, stressed 'the dangerous lies' and's conspiracy.'
On Saturday, the U.S. Democratic Party, Maxine Waters, had denied that a member of her team had published the personal information of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of legalists.
The Democratic Party in Los Angeles claims that these accusations are due to "friends" and web sites.
"A lie, lies and lies are even more humiliating," wrote Waters in an article on Twitter.
Reportedly, leaking information included a private home address and the number of Senator U.S. Senator New York City from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrritch, from Utah.
These information started online on Thursday, which was not known at the Capitol Hill Court during the trial of the Senate's hearing of sexual assault against the candidate for the Supreme Court’s Supreme Court.
This information was revealed for a short time after the three senators questioned Kavalaugh.
The Hill wrote: Web pages of the security department such as Gateway Finndit and RedState believe that the source of the articles related to Mrs. Waters' office and revealing information about one of Mrs. Waters' employees.
Mrs. Waters continues to say, "This unsatisfying base is completely wrong and absolutely a lie."
"The officer in my office has been violated by identity, personal information, and the security of these false and false charges.
It's not true, and it's absolutely a lie."
This statement of Mrs. Waters immediately drew online criticisms, including the secretary of the White House, Mr. Ari Fleischer.
"You're denying this for anger" Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that she has no gas to be a member of Congress.
When someone is charged with a behavior that is not done by them, they should not be angry.
They're not challenged.
They're not questioned about the motives of the accused.
They must be calm and quiet."
Fleischer seems to be comparing Waters' reaction to the reaction of JARE Kander Kavalaugh in front of the Democratic Party's criticisms and critics who also accuse him of being too angry during the annual hearing.
Omar Navro, a Republican candidate running into Waters' position during the mid-term election, also shows a point on Twitter.
"If true" would be big if it was true, he wrote on Twitter.
Mrs. Waters declared that her office warned "the authorities and the law enforcement agency about these wrong charges.
"We're going to make sure the unsub is brought out of the light," she continued to say, "and they're going to be responsible for all the actions that could cause harm and danger to any of my employees."
Let's estimate Johnny English to the lake -- the funny and funny agent of Rowan Atkinson.
Now, it's possible to see a fairly traditional trend in any new movie that has the British factor is looking for the meaning of Brexit, and the next exercise of the film of Johnny English is not an exception.
Will acting self - centeredly about how useless we are to become a new export opportunity for this nation?
Anyway, Agent Johnny English is a simple representation of a comic book designed for non-English areas.
Of course, he's a secret agent, although he's always acting weirdly in the way of Detective Clouseau, mixed his humor and something to contribute to the Festival of Clouseau in 2012.
The role of the character is also based on the visitor and the international mystery man Atkinson, who was playing in the Barclaycard TV, who now had been in the forgotten and causing chaos when he woke up.
There's some interesting scene in the latest Johnny English.
I like the scene Johnny English coming near the helicopter while wearing the middle-fashioned suit and the hats hit his hat.
Although Atkinson's humor was fully displayed, the funny element here seemed to be less than enough weight and enough, especially when the movie brands were like the Dane and the impossible mission had made the play a little bit of taste.
The funny element in this movie can only make fun of children, I think that Johnny English's stupid mistakes have nothing to do with it and that's as interesting as the jokes in the silent movie Mr. Atkinson's.
The situation that led the story was that England was in serious trouble.
The news that invaded the British secret spy network, revealed the identity of all British agents working outside, led to the loss of an agent who was working on a mission, a very sorry little role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance of the Prime Minister, a proud and powerful character, who is now facing this political crisis: Emma Thompson has been very good at the version of the Prime Minister Teresa May, but according to the script you don't have a lot of land.
Investigators report that the identity of all agents has been revealed and that you will have to promote an art agent.
And that guy, Johnny English, is now teaching in a country, but in fact, he's conducting lessons outside of the program to become a secret spy: there's some pretty interesting joke here, because English teaches students to be agents in Rock Music.
English was summoned back to the emergency Hall and met with the ex-Cough poor assistant, who was led by actor Ben Miller.
Bough's now married, too much for a woman to ride a charming submarine.
So, the Batman and Robins are causing problems with the Queen's orders to return to the mission and meet Olga Kurylenko in the role of the beautiful lady Ohelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into a dangerous situation according to the curse of the sexy technology community after claiming he can solve all the problems of the British computer: Jason Volta, led by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough started an adventure with these amazing tricks: after covering the table, they burned a French restaurant in the blink of the eye; causing confusion on Volta; and English made even more a mess when they tried to use the magic ear to examine Volta's house.
At the end of the movie, the tights will be removed, but the rise will be pretty much like the TV channels for children.
It's quite a work.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I can't ask the question: The film industry is really not able to give Rowan Atkinson a fair role, worthy of your talent?
The Ambier rejected information building plans for English people to work for four days but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's labor party will consider an advanced plan, allowing the English people to work four days a day but to receive five days' wages.
According to information received, this party wants the businessman to transfer his savings by the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers by giving them another day's rest.
So that means that the staff is off for three days but still receives the same pay.
The sources say that this idea is "integrating" with this party's economic show and are planning to enhance the support of this country's workers.
The British Council confirmed that turning to work four days a day or so is a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
An advanced source from the Times said to Sunday Times: 'The project that controls plans will be published at the end of this year.
'This goal is not possible for a short time, but working four days a day is a wish that fits the interests of this party's boss in a balanced economic balance to the workers and the common industrial strategy of the party.'
The International Party won't be the first to accept this idea, and the blue party is committed to work four days in the campaign in 2017.
However, this idea has not yet been passed by the whole party.
"The book works four days and days is not the policy of the party and the party is not now looking at this policy."
The dark minister John McDonnell took advantage of the labor conference last week to enhance his vision of a social revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell says that he is determined to regain power from the hands of the unknown governor, and'The Antichrists' at the service companies of helpful services.
These plans of the Dark President also mean that the popularholders in water companies may not get all their shares back because the government of the Communist Party can apply't-based terms on behavior considered wrong.
He also confirmed the plan for the workers to join the company's board and set up a full-of-the-art fund to give 10% parts of private companies to the company, from then on, they had the ability to receive her every year to 500 pounds of English.
Lindsey Ephesians, John Kennedy shared in "60 Minutes" program about the FBI's results of Kavanugh's investigation on Kavalaugh made them change their decision.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Kavalaugh has delayed his final vote to appoint him to the Supreme Court for at least a week and asks the question whether the results of the federal intelligence could cause any Republicans to withdraw support.
In a broadcast interview on Sunday, the reporter of "60 Minutes" Mr. Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senator John Kennedy and Jamesson if the FBI could find some evidence that would make these senators change their decision.
Mr. Kennedy is more open to his superiors from South Carolina State.
"I suppose of course," said Mr. Kennedy.
"I said in hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavalaugh.
I called him after the incident, which means after the accused was given and asked, "Do you do that?"
He answers very firmly, firmly and firmly."
However, Graham’s vote seems to have been absolutely certain.
He said, "I've decided about the Kavunaugh and there's only one charges of destruction that make me change."
"Mr. Ford, I don't know about what happened, but I know one thing: Mr. Javier has denied very strong enough," said obeys, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people she told her name couldn't verify the story.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything new."
What is the global civil ceremony, and what does it contribute to the removal of poverty?
This Saturday, New York will announce the global public festival, a annual music event with the participation of an impressive starship to carry out a mission as well as an impressive mission: the end of the world’s poverty.
In the seventh year of this event, the global public festival will see tens of thousands of people on the Great LGDs of Central Park not only to enjoy Janet Jackson's performance, Cardi B, but also to improve their sense of the real purpose of the event to end the extreme poverty in 2030.
The global public festival, which began to be held since 2012, was the expansion of the global project, an international group of action groups with hope of an end to poverty by increasing the number of active people fighting poverty.
To receive a ticket into the free door for this event (that is, when you're willing to pay for the VIP ticket), the musicer must complete a series of missions or a volunteer, send an email to a world leader, call a phone, or any other form of meaning to help raise awareness of the purpose of the loss of poverty.
But how did this global national festival achieve success, when there are only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
The idea of winning the ticket to a free night for people is a real way to convince people to call the action, or just another form of the keyboard movement -- people feel that they're making a real difference by signing online requests or sending a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, the global public organization has been saying that there are over 10 million "armal" from those who support it, pushing a series of different targets.
They say that these actions have helped to motivate the world’s leaders to make commitments and policies that correspond to over 37 billion dollars were established to improve the lives of more than 2,25 billion people in 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announced from the group’s actions, with at least 10 billion dollars being sold or funded.
To this day, funded funds have been directly affected by nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some major commitments include The Power of Nutriation, a partner of investors, and the people who make the commitment, the commitment to "A child’s full potential," promised to provide 25 million dollars for Rwanda to end the loss of the country after receiving more than 4700 articles from the global public group.
"with support from the British government, aidors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice into a seal in the history," said the Ullman Power Program, who shared with the audience in a live show in London in April 2018.
This group also reported that after more than 5,000 acts of calling the Kingdom of England improves mothers and children, the government has published financial aid to a project called the health - care power, which ensures rebirth for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the questions that is common on the group's website "What makes you believe that we can end the extreme poverty?"
The global citizens said, "This will be a long and difficult way-- sometimes we will fail.
But just like civil rights and previous racial movement, we will succeed because together we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, the aland, the Deborra-Leeness, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is a number of artists who will be involved in the event of this year in New York, by Deborra-Lee Fureness and Hugh Jackman.

He continued to compare Washington to Russia and Iran, and he noticed that these two methods worked the same way.
"The economy that Iran and Russia can choose is to take advantage of and change fuel," he said, while calling Russia "the only strong one" with the economy based on fossil fuel.

18 states and D.C. support the challenge of new refugees.
Ten states and Diistrict of Columbia are supporting the challenge of challenging the new U.S. policy against refugees who run away from gangs or domestic violence.
NBC News delivered 18 states and D.C. who sent a short document on Friday in Washington to support refugees who were begging for this policy.
They're full of applications in the Grace and Cross case that the American People's Free Forces have not yet been revealed in August to protest federal policy.
She said her lover's "and the son of the members of his violent gang" had abused her, but the U.S. officials refused to ask for her refugees on July 20,07.
You're being held in Texas.
The prosecutor of the state supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where there were a large number of people who applied for refugees in the United States, when countries faced the issues of gangs and domestic violence.
America's new refugees have turned against the decision of 2014 by the National Security Council that allows immigrants to have no papers on their own to flee domestic violence to ask for refugees.
The District of Columbia Racine stated on Friday that the new policy has ignored state, federal and international law system.
"The federal policy requires to look at all the refugees' applications based on the event and specific circumstances of the person's request and policy against that rule," said the brief text of the presentation.
The prosecutors also argue in short text that the policy of refusing immigration damages the U.S. economy, because immigrants have a lot of potential to become businessman and "full-of-the-art jobs."
The general Jeff Sessions requires single-sexcientists not to continue to allow refugees to flee from domestic violence and the abuse of gangs in June.

The desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of deaths increased in the search for survivors
For those who survive, the situation becomes worse.
"The tension," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother when she was thankful for her son who was fevered at a desperate evacuate center in Palu City.
"One minute an ambulance carries more people in.
The source of clean water is very rare."
The people returned to their destroyed house, picked up their stuff in the water, tried to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of wounded people and hospitals are completely overloaded, after the damage caused by a seven-5-year earthquake.
Some of them were injured, including Dwi Haris broken their backs and shoulders lying outside the Palu Army hospital.
His tears turned out as he remembered the feeling of a severe earthquake that moved the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.

I don't know what happened to my wife and children.
I hope they're all safe."
The U.S. ambassador accused China's crime with 'Tisan charges.'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four - page commercial in a U.S. newspaper referring to the general benefits of the U.S. Central American business, the American ambassador in China accused Beijing to use the U.S. newspaper to spread.
The last Wednesday, President of the United States, mentioned an additional amount of China Daily to Des Moines Regiller - Iowa's best selling newspaper -- after the charges of China trying to intervene in the United States on November 6, China has rejected the charges.
TT.P.'s pressure on Beijing's attempts to intervene in the U.S. election marks a new period in an additional increase of pressure to Washington's Chinese, according to what the American officials share with Reuters.
Although foreign governments have placed commercial advertising in full interest, Beijing, and Washington are now trapped in the climbing trade, with evidence that they've put high taxes on their own.
The Chinese and American experts say that China's tax policy to retaliate during the first stage of the conflict was designed to enter exports in the state of TT.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador in China and former governor of Iowa, the state of exporting large farms to China, says that Beijing has hurt workers, farmers, and business.
Branstad wrote an idea in the Des Moines Regicer on Sunday, saying, "The Chinese continues to engage in such abuse by running a campaign on our own free newspaper."
"To try to spread it, the Chinese government is using the American freedom of speech and the American newspaper freedom to put an ad on the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In return, in the press in the streets of Beijing, you're very rarely able to find differences and will not see any genuine reflection of the different Chinese opinion of China's economics, because it's clear that the media is completely in the control of the Chinese Republic," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the most common newspapers in China has avoided his post proposal", although he does not say exactly what newspaper it is.
The analysts warned the Republicans that they were making women separate before the election with Kavanaugh's mission.
When many Republicans first stood out to protect the candidate for the Supreme Court of Kavalaugh in advance of some sexual assault charges, the analyst warned that they might have to respond strongly, especially from women, in the middle of the next election.
The emotion around this is pretty strong and most Republican candidates in the election list show that they want to continue to vote.
There's something we can't do again," Grant Reeher, a political professor at the University of Syracuse, who told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Mr. Reeher said he didn't think that Senator Jeff Folke (Bag R-Arizona) pressed the agreed button for the FBI to perform enough research to heal the angry candidates.
The Washington newspaper, D.C. led Kree Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national speaker of the MoveOn Friday: "The women won't forget what happened yesterday-- they won't forget and they won't forget about it tomorrow."
Mic reported: On Friday morning, the protesters "The 11th is coming!" as they march on the Senate hall because the Republicans are taking control of the Justice Committee have chosen to continue to vote for Kavaugh no matter what Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement.
"The love and motivation of democracy will be higher than ever," said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst who shares with the news page.
"It is said that this motivation is now very high; yes.
But even higher, especially among women in the suburbs and young votes, from 18 to 29 years of age, often doesn't vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford openly swore the details of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's candidate, experts claimed that the public might have a violent response if the Republicans continued to confirm it.
NBC News led Michael Steele, former President of the Republican Party last week, saying, "This could be a mess that the Republicans had to solve."
"The problem is not just whether the committee's vote or the official vote, or whether Kavalaugh has become a Supreme Court judge, but the more important issue is how the Republicans handle this election and the way they treat the accused," said Guy filterer, director of the Primates USA, a group that supports the Republican Party, says with the news channel.
The American people, however, had a negative view of how this expression should have been trusted in Ford or Kavanaugh’s testimony, which seems to have been more suspicious of Brother Kavanaugh.
A new poll published by youGov showed that 41 percent of the people who answered certain or could believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they were certain or can trust Kavaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of the people answered that Kavanaugh could either be false or certainly lie when it was only 30 percent said that Ford was certain or might have lied.
After Folke press the contract button, the FBI is conducting a search on Mrs. Ford's charges and at least another accused, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian delivered the message.
Ford swore to the Senate Committee last week that Kavalaugh attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez charged the Supreme Court's position to reveal his sexual parts before her as they attended a party during the study period in Knuts in 1980.

The company now has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a secure foundation that was purchased by IBM, some developers have signed contracts to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world have been able to create their own focus applications with tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team didn't discuss with "Facebook and Google about whether it changed completely or not because all of their business models could completely upgrade after one night.
"We don't need to ask them."
In an article on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote, "The destiny of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on the Solid foundation."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when the United World Wide Web was formed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee is a powerful name in the Internet's debate about neutrality.
Although we've released the Inrupt Project, Berners-Lee will continue to take the role of the founder and director of the World Wide Web, the Web Foundation and the Open Institute.
"I am so optimistic about the next era of the web," said Berners-Lee.
The anniversary of the missionary Bernard Vann received the Victoria Cross during World War 1.
The only festival of 100 years of the British Church was given the Cross of Queen Victoria during the first world war as a warrior held in his hometown.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 18 in the attack on Belle and Lehaucourt.
However, he died from being shot four days later, and he had never known that he had won the highest honor of the British army.
On Saturday, his two grandsons revealed a memory stone in the march in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of these sons, Michael Vann, said that this was "a beautiful symbol" when the stone was displayed exactly 100 years after the war helped his grandfather win the chapter.
According to London newspaper, on September 29, 1818, Colonel Vann led his crew across Toretto de Saint-Queenin "by the thick fog, under fire from the rifle and the machine gun."
Then, he went straight into a bullet and with the great "tribution," he led the battalion up above, before he hit a rifle and beat down three uniques.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on April 4, 18 - a month after the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, says that my grandfather's actions are "the action I've never done, but there's humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also put a flower after the Royal American Music band.
Michael Vann said that he felt a great deal of pleasure in the parade and "the courage of a true hero would be recorded by a lot of people."
A fan of martial arts all night to see Bellators 206, but they finally get Peppa Pig.
Imagine you've been up all night to see Bellator 206 with a hard stand, but you're finally denied the main event.
The presentation from San Jose said there were 13 games, six games on the main card and were live in England on Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory 16.
Some feel that they are not respected after they wake up in the morning to watch the game.
A fan shows on Twitter that it's like moving a show into a video of children's cartoons like "a ridiculous joke."
"The rule of martial arts at 6: 00 a.m. is inappropriate, so they have to turn into a program for children," said Dave Schwartz, the vice president of Bellator in charge of the market and tell us when asked about this program.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
President Bellator, Scott Coker said they're looking at a broadcast schedule to make sure the British audience can watch the show in the future.
Mr. Coker said, "I think we can solve the problem if we give it back."
"But there's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we can't handle the problem until Sunday after our hour, but it's Monday over their hour.
But we're trying to find a solution.
Believe me, when people change the program, there's a lot of messages over and those messages aren't very friendly.
We've been trying to fix it, we've initially assumed it's a technical problem.
But that's not the end of it, it's the government rule.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of games down to the year, instead of the first six games -- the year is the number of games we've often provided, and we've been trying to provide the level of the fan.
This is a really unfortunate situation."
The Dememor Island Discs program: Tom Daley feels 's bad' for sexual trends.
The Olympic dancer Tom Daley said that when he grew up, he always felt the loss of everyone because of his sexual trend -- but that was his success.
The 24-year-old athlete, he didn't realize "I'm no one" until he was studying.
Talking in the Dememor Island Discs of Taiwan 4 by Lauren Laverne, he said that he had spoken about the rights of male gay people to bring hope to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
The leader of this long-term program, Kirsty Young, has spent a few months in the healing program.
One of the first ones led by Lavene, Daley appears like a abandoned man, saying that he feels "stink" everybody, because "my personality is not accepted as a son and daughter."
He said, "To this day, the feeling of loss and the difference is still there, becoming motivation and strength that I can succeed."
I want to prove that you've got something to accomplish so people don't be disappointed to know the truth about your sexual trend.
This Olympic medal has become a positive athlete for the LGBT community, and he uses his image at the National Games in Australia this year to call more than many countries against gay people.
He said that he spoke up because he felt very lucky to be able to live open without being separated and want to bring hope to others.
The three-time champions of the world share that he loves a man -- American film producer Dustin Lance Black.
Daley was married to the winner of Oscar's winning over 20 years old last year, but he told me that age has never been a barrier between you two.
"When you have to go through so much pain as a child"-- he was in the first Olympic Games when he was 14 and his father died because of cancer three years later -- it would be very difficult to find someone with that experience of life.
The couple became his parents, Robert Ray Black-Daley boy in June and Daley said that his whole "violent" world has changed.
"If last year you ask, my goal is 'I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"But you know, there's more important than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son, Robert, died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked was that they had a New York Games in London in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front seat.
"I couldn't tell him that 'cha couldn't sit in the front row anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he took off his last breath and even until he stopped breathing and went away forever, I still couldn't admit that he had to be an impossible man."
The following year Daley fought at the Olympic Games in 2012 and won his medal.
"I just know that it's the dream of my whole life -- dancing in front of the great crowd at the Olympic Games, actually, there's no greater feeling than that," he said.
It's also an inspiration for you to choose the first song of Heather Small's first song -- the song along with him during his training to the Olympic Games and still make him touch every time he hears it again.
The Dememor Island Discs program is released on the 4th Bridge at 11:15 p.m., Sunday.
Mickelson was short on the couch that was sent to Ryder on Saturday.
The American player Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when playing his 47th-time Ryder game, but you're going to have to raise your character to avoid this record to be a sad experience.
Mickelson was playing in the event for two years this time, but Captain Jim Hardyk left him sitting in a row of faourball and foursome days on Saturday.
Instead of being a center of action like when in the United States, the five-time winner has to spend all day working as an athlete and playing games with the hope of getting out of the pain.
The 48-year-old fighter with the school was the beatings on the flat face never to be the ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National Forum, even if you're at the top of the line, because the wrong beatings here are going to suffer severe consequences.
And if it's not enough to get involved in this golf field, Mickelson has to fight on the 9th day of Sunday, against his opponent is the British champion of Francesco Molinari.
If the U.S. team, now losing four points before it starts the 12-goet game, it's very important to start the game.
Furyk expressed confidence in his golf and did not talk too much.
"He's very clear about his role today, he's beating on my back, around me and saying he'll be ready for tomorrow," said Javierk.
"He's very confident.
He's a legend and has contributed a lot to the team, in the past and in this week.
I could never imagine he played two games.
I imagine more, but that's how things happen and we think it's the right way.
He wants to fight, like all the other team."
This Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record, becoming the most in the Ryder Games.
That could also be his career ending at the Ryder because the tops of your personal record have never been seen in this tournament.
Mickelson has 18 victorys, 20 winnings and peace, although Furyk assumes that his presence brings invisible value to the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he explains.
"I think young golfers are happy to meet him and this week is pretty fun.
What he's dedicated is more than the competition."
Captain of the European recruit Thomas have known that the advantage could quickly disappear.
Thomas Ezekiel, the head of the European recruit, has experienced that even though his team was leading a lot before entering the final single match of Ryder's season, the outcome could still be easy to reverse in a very uncomfortable way.
The Dane began to fight in 1997 at Valderrama, including their team, under the lead of Seve Balesteros in the last five points from the U.S. recruits, but at last only won the 14-1344-1344.
"You've always had to remind yourself that we've been leading a lot in Valderrama; we've been taking a lot of lead in Brokline and we lost, in Valderrama, we won, but very tightly said, "with the look of the mirror after watching theClass of 2018 battle with winning 5-3 on Friday and taking 10-6 on the Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in the team that it's not over.
You still have to focus on the spirit tomorrow.
It's good to go to the yard and fight.
The game isn't over when the score's not on the table.
We have the goal of winning this year and that's our focus.
I always say that I focus on my 12 players, but we also understand the power of your team -- they're the best players in the world."
Happy joy in the display of his golf players on the field of golf, with the addition: "I'll never say anything.
It'll be another war tomorrow.
Tomorrow is the display of each individual and will definitely be different.
It'll be great if you fight with your pair and everything happens well, but when you do your personal competition, all the potential of a golfman will be revealed.
It's the message that you have to share with all the golfers, that they have to be ready for the best match tomorrow.
Now a pair of competitions must be separated and one must be ready for the best."
In contrast, the leader of the opponent, Jim Hardyk, expects his players to show better personal abilities than when he's playing with the couple, except for Jordan Ridderth and Justin Thomas has won three points in four points.
Shark himself had spent both directions on the last day, who had been a winner at Brookline before he failed while the European team was called "Parmed in Medinah."
"I remember every single word," he said when he was asked about Ben Crenshaw, the leader of the team in 1999, who gathered and encouraged the golfers before the last day.
"We have 12 important fights tomorrow, but you're going to want to start as soon as you see in Brookline, or as you see in Medinah.
When the result is in a trend, the games in the middle will suffer a lot of pressure.
We built the team that way and sent the golf to the field in strategy and tried to make a wonder tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to lead the team and face the Rory McIlroy in the top fight, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Horter, other European golfers in the first series.
"I chose this group, in that order because I believe that's how to get through" said the choice for my single fight.
Germany's new warship continued to be put in use.
Local media reports: The German Navy’s newest enemyship ship was supposed to be running in 2014 to replace the old Cold Warship, but at least five years later it would have been possible to run by an error system and increase cost.
Report Die Zeit led the military speaker: "Rheinland-Palz," the leading ship of a completely new Baden-Wertemberg, is now delayed by the early 2019.
This ship was supposed to have been assigned to the Navy in 2014, but the problems after the delivery had prevented this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wretemberg ships that the Navy ordered every year will replace the old Burden-Wertem.
So that means that these ships will be equipped with a strong gun, a series of rockets, a series of unsatisfying missiles, some invisible technologies, such as reducing radar, infrared, and sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance time - able to develop the latest axis ships away from the national ports up to two years.
However, this constant delay means that these modern war ships -- said to help Germany control the foreign nations -- would be lost at the beginning of the use, the Die Zeit.
The unlucky F125 ship became a journalist last year when the German Navy refused to run the train and returned to the Blohm ship factory & Vosss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship ship to the ship's building after delivering it.
There's very little information about the reason behind returning this ship, but the German media refers to "getting software and hardware" seriously, which leads to a completely useless battleship if you're involved in a fight mission.
The special software failure because the Baden-Wertemberg ship will be a team of 120 sailors running - just half of the people on the old Bremens.
At the same time, it is possible to see that the weight of the ship has increased greatly, resulting in increased efficiency and increased performance in the Navy's future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" weighed 350 tons is said to be twice the same warship that Germans used during World War II.
Except for the missing hardware, the cost of the entire project - including the crew's training -- it's a serious problem.
The project is said to have a significant team up to the number three, one billion ($3,6 billion) - while the initial estimate is 2602 billion.
The most important problem of training the new axis has become, in recent times, warning about German Navy powers is getting smaller and smaller.
In the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German National Congress, acknowledged the real Navy, "The Warship is capable of combating."
This official stated that the problem became worse during the time, since the old ship had stopped its operation but had no ship replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wertemberg were qualified to join the Navy.
National Trust Organization is listening to the secret life of bats.
A new study is being conducted in a stateland in Scotland to reveal how bats use natural vision to hunt food.
Hope these findings will shed light on the behavior of these unique mammals and guide these future life - saving activities.
This study was conducted by scientists of National Trust for Scotland, following the course of popular bats, mosquito bats (skno pipistellers), brown bats and Dauthon in the Inveewe area in Western Ross.
Special recording will be placed at important locations around the research area to monitor the activities of these bats during the season.
SUS and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys with hand-tips.
The audio analyst will proceed to analyze all the recordings and determine the frequency of bats and the purpose of the sound of each particular bat.
Then, maps and reports of bats' environment will be created to have a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, the natural guardian of NTS, hoping the result would help determine what life area has the most important role for bats and how every living creature lives in that environment.
This information will help determine the benefits of the life - handling operations of animals, such as plants and the best way to protect the bats and other related species.
The bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have greatly reduced over the past century.
They're threatened by building and developing an impact on bats' beans and losing their environment.
Tua bin the wind and light systems, fly traps, some chemical treatment for the building materials, as well as the cat's attacks can also pose a risk for bats.
Batman isn't completely blind.
However, because of the habit of hunting at night, the ears are more useful than their eyes when they lie down and catch their prey.
They use a very sophisticated sound position technology to identify the obstacles on the flightway.
NTS is responsible for over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 760,000 in all the country, and especially for bats.
There are ten trained experts who regularly perform surveys, tests, and sometimes participate in animal rescues.
This organization even established Scotland's first and only bat defense in the Treave land in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of Scotland's ten bats.
Manage the land, David Thompson said that the land is their ideal territory.
"Treve is a wonderful environment for bats," he said.
"We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of huge trees and good environment.
But there's still a lot of mystery about bats, so the work here and in other facilities will help us understand more about what bats need to grow."
He stressed the importance of checking the bat's life before preserving the land, because their natural destruction could kill up to 400 females and vomitings, almost completely destroy the pants.
Gene is a protected species and killing, disturbing, or destroying their beans is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scotlandn Security Department, encouraged the community to share in help.
She said, "We still need to learn more about bats and with many species, we can't know how far their communities are."
Ronaldo rejected rape charges and his lawyer prepared for the German magazine.
Corporo Ronaldo says that sex charges against you are "false believe" and someone who wants to profit with your age.
Your lawyer is about to file a German Derbelliegel newspaper for reporting the charges.
The Portuguese religion now playing for the Juventus team has been charged with rape of an American woman, known as Kathryn Mayorga, in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
The Dermitelgel delivered the news on Friday: this guy was supposed to pay this woman $ 375,000 to remain silent about the matter.
In the live video on Instagram before 142 million people follow a few hours after the charges are published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, claims that it's a fake news.
"No, no, no.
What they say today is all fake news, player five times the gold ball is in front of the camera.
"They want to take advantage of my age to draw advantage.
That's normal.
Told my name, they're famous, but it's just part of their work.
I'm a happy man and everything's good," he's an additional and smiling player.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Japan for this charge, and they call it "the suspect that can't be accepted for private life."
Dr. Christian Schertz says that this player's going to be asked to pay for the moral damages of the crime, maybe one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The case in the charges was supposed to happen in June 2009 at a high school room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in the night box, Ronaldo and Mayorga were supposed to return to this player's spare room, according to the record at Clark County, Nevada, he was accused of rapeing her at the hotel.
Mayorga said Ronaldo fell down after the accused and said that he "99%" was "good man," only "1%" was not good.
There is a document that Ronaldo confirms that the two sides produce sexual relations, but based on agreements.
Mayorga also said that she came to the police station and was photographed at the hospital, but she later agreed to compromise in court because she was “resolved of revenge" and worried about the public shame.
This 34-year-old woman said that she's trying to reverse her previous resolution because she's continued to be traumad by the charges.
At the time of the charge given, Ronaldo was preparing from Manchester United Kingdom to Real Madrid, but in the end of this summer, he moved to play for the Italian giant Juve in the transfer of 100 million dollars.
Brexit: You'll always regret 'cause you lost your car producer.
Chief Greg Clark says that the United Kingdom of England will forever regret it if it loses the world's head for its back car production.
He also added that quite a bit of a worry, when Toyotta “was going to share it with Jehovah’s Witnesses that if you left the European Union without any other agreement, they would stop producing at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturers say that the delays at the border in the case of Brexit can lead to loss of employment.
The Burnaston factory -- where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota - produced nearly 150,000 in last year, 90% were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My point is if you're completely out of the European Union at the end of March, we're gonna have to stop producing this factory," said the director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain are also concerned about leaving EU without a trade deal across the border, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said they'd shut down Mini's factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car producers is the risk of supplying in the case of Brexit without a different deal.
Toyota's production chain works under the rule of "just-in-time," with parts provided in the United Kingdom of England and the European Union each 50 minutes for the production lines by order.
If you leave EU without another deal on 29/03, there's a possibility that happens at the border, and it's worried that it can slow down and miss.
Toyota said this company couldn't keep the store worth too much a day at the Derbyshire factory, so they'd have to stop producing.
Mr. Clark said that the plan of the Prime Minister Theresa May for a relationship with the future European Union will be "favoured to avoid checking at the border."
"We need a deal, we want to have the best deal, not just to make sure it's a success in the present, but to make sure we catch this opportunity," he said in the Today Today of the 4.
"The witness from Toyota as well as the other car producer shows that we need to make sure we keep on doing it."
Toyota had not yet announced how long it would be to stop producing, but in the long run, they warned that increased costs would reduce the competition of the factory and eventually, the workers would lose their job.
Peter Tsouvalris has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, and as the United Kingdom Company in the factory, he says that his members are getting more anxious: "With my experience when they lose these jobs, there's never again.
The government spokesman claims, "We've built an accurate and reliable plan for the relationship with the European Union in the future."
The White House announced a meeting between TT.M.D. and Mr. 21.stein might be delayed again.
The White House announced on Sunday: the High Court's high-end meeting with the Prime Minister Rodstein could be "one more week" when the struggle for the trial of the Supreme Court's position of the Supreme Court is continuing.
The work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who's investigating the intervention of the Russian election, is connected between the assistants of TTlop and Russia and the ability to interfere with justice.
The release of the vice president of the Justice Department, along with Mueller, would have been difficult to act independently, had raised up many Washington rumors for months.
In the beginning of this month, the New York Times brought news about the use of earphones and the ability to cut the President through the 25th Court.
- What's the matter? - I'm sorry.
But two weeks ago, he went to the White House among the rumors that he was about to resign.
Instead, his meeting with President Papp - who was then visiting the United Nations Council in New York - was scheduled on Thursday.
President Zop said, "no" fired the man, and the meeting was delayed to avoid the hearing of the Supreme Court's hearing between Kavanugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, which stood up to witness.
On Friday, President Kopp asked the FBI to take a week to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh, and continue to delay the Senate's full vote.
President's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting of day, she said, "The date is not set, it may be that in this week, the reason for this delay is because other problems are taking place at the Supreme Court.
But we'll soon get the news and the press will be updated."
Some reporters may disagree with that statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since October 10th.
Chris Wallace asked her about this.
Sanders says that the absence of press conferences isn't because he doesn't like TV reporters, although she said, "I also agree that real reporters are a lot of things."
Then she suggested that further direct connection between President Papp and the press.
"The president is doing more answers than any previous president," she added without giving evidence: "We've looked at the number of press conferences."
Sanders said that there would still be press conferences, but if the press had a direct chance to ask the President, that would be much better than talking to me.
We've been trying so hard and you've seen that we've been doing a lot of work over the last few weeks, this will replace a press conference when you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
President Melop often answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends the opening or in the press conferences when the authorities visit him.
The regular press conferences are often very rare.
This week, in New York, the president was supposed to have declared the reason but he appeared suddenly to the strange form in front of the press.
The minister of health wrote to the European Union staff who worked in the medical industry in Scotland to talk about the fear of Brexit
The minister of health wrote to the European Union staff who worked in the medical industry in Scotland to express their appreciation for the country and to expect the employees to stay behind Brexit.
The Secretary of State Jeane Freeman sent a letter with a message to resign in six months after the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union.
The Scotland government pledged to support the expenses of the request for a certificate of the country of the European Union who was working in the assigned service.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "In this summer, the negotiations between Britain and the European Union of Europe about the fact that you're still pulling out of the European Union, the decision will be made in this fall.
But the British government is also pushing the prepping task for the script may not be able to make a deal.
I know this is a bad time for all of you.
That's why I want to repeat that I now appreciate the contribution of each worker, no matter what their nationality is.
Moreover, colleagues from the European Union have brought great experience and skill to help to strengthen and improve medical services, and to benefit our patients and our communities.
Scotland is completely your home, and we'd love you to stay."
Christion Abercrombie had to experience an emergency surgery after a headache.
The coverback of Tigers in Tennessee, Christion Abercrombie had to go through an emergency operation after the first injury in the 31-27 fight before Minitlt Commores on Saturday, Mike Organ in Tennessee.
The head of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told the reporters that the injury happened just before the quarter break.
"He runs towards the border and falls down," said Reed.
The coach and the medical staff have given Abercrombie anesthesia right at the border before they put you up and take you to an additional test.
A former state official from Tennessee told Chris Harris at the WMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that AArcrombie was in surgery at the Cybbit Hospital Center.
Harris adds, "There's details about the level of injury and Tennessee's trying to figure out when the injury happened.
Abercrombie, a second-year student of the red shirt, first battled under the state color of Tennessee after moving back from Illinois.
You have a total of five games on Saturday before you're removed from the game and you have 18 games in this season.
The foreigners who buy the real estate in England will be more taxed.
The foreigners who buy real estate in England are going to be more taxed, and this additional increase will be used to help homeless people with Toy's new policies.
This change will be disabled in the attempt to attract Corbyn’s young candidate.
The increase in taxes will apply to those who do not pay taxes in England.
This policy budget will help to increase to 120 million pounds a year - to help the homeless
The foreigners who buy the real estate in England are going to be taxed -- this additional increase will be used to help homeless people, General Theresa May will announce today.
This change will be disabled by the effort to attract young Jeremy Corbyn's young votes with a higher price supply and aim to the high income object.
The increase in taxes will apply to individuals and businesses not paying taxes in England, which will move the government’s efforts to fight current economic conditions.
In addition to the present tax rate, the higher tax levels were published two years ago for the second house and the purchase houses just to - possibly three percent.
The financial planned change will help to increase to 120 million pounds a year.
The estimate of 13 percent of the new estate that was built in London was sold to people who were not British citizens, which pushed the house price high and made it more difficult for people to buy the house for the first time.
Many of the rich areas of the country -- especially in the capital -- became a ghost town because most foreigners bought their home for most of their time in another country.
The new policy was given only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked to cut tax off so that many young people could have the opportunity to own the first house.
He accused the large construction companies to keep high real estate by taking the land but not using it, and he asked the General May to give up on the prices of the house to overcome the house in England.
Mr. Corbyn also announced a series of household reforms to attract the election, including control over renting the house and ending the "no error."
He also wanted to give the council more powerful to build a new house.
Mrs. May said, "I said I was going to take my time to restore my English dream--that life would be better for the new generation.
And that means that the house market is in a lot of trouble right now.
England will always open the door for those who want to live, work and build life here.
This does not mean, however, that people who are not living in England and that companies with foreign facilities can easily buy homes like hard - working citizens.
For a lot of people, the dream of having a house has become too far away and it's still very big."
Jack Ross: My last hope is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross said that his last "supertance" was to be the manager of the Scotland team at some point.
Scot, 42 years old, is facing the challenge of the North American Club, now holding the third place at League One, less than three points less than the first.
He moved to the light stadium this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scotlands for the last week.
"I want to fight for my country as a player.
I had the hat with the letter B logo, and that's what I wanted, "Ross said to the Sportsound of the solvent Scotland.
"My childhood was connected to Scotland's games in Hampden with my father, and that's always what I remember.
However, that opportunity will come if I succeed in managing the club."
Sunderland's stewards before Ross included Dick Advoat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Nell, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Atloa Athlotic says that he did not feel pressured to be a successor after such great age names at such a large club, he had previously refused the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Supply to me at this moment will be judged by 'I can take the club back to the Premier League?'
The organization and the material at this club certainly belongs to the Premier League, "He said."
"This is not a task to achieve easily, but I just consider myself successful if I can get the club back to the tournament."
Ross only had three years as manager, after a while as manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in his training role at Hearts.
Later, he helped Allora restore his position after fall in third grade, and he took St Morren from the risk of falling out of class to the next season champion.
Ross says that he now feels very comfortable in his career playing ball at cynicus, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mreren and “Ademical.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls in his role as the leader of Alloa.
"I really believe that I'm perfect in management more than a player.
This may sound strange because I've been pretty successful, having good income and gaining certain success as a player.
But the game is often not easy.
There's a lot of things you have to face every week.
I still had to endure the stress and pressure of my work, but I was satisfied with the management work.
I've always wanted to do management work and now I'm doing it, and I'm doing it, I feel most comfortable being myself all over my adult life."

The summer sun heat has increased the income of the bars that are in the U.K. but has added pressure to the restaurants.
The bars and bars have witnessed increase in 2,7 percent in July, but the sales in restaurants has reduced 4,8%.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business counseling company, came up with the data, said: "The long stretch and the British recruits are in the world Cup that tend to sell in the same month as July, when the bars increase 2,8%, the restaurants are much more deeply affected.
The increase in restaurants has reduced 1,8% in June has worsened in July.
The bars and the bars are the fastest growth rate in comparison to the size of the restaurant.
Food bars are also affected by heat, although they are not as serious as restaurants.
Looks like everybody just wants to drink.
He sold his drinks at the bars and the bars that had been run up six-6% in the month while the sales went down by three percent."
Paul Newman, an expert in entertainment and RSM, said: "These results show the trends that we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of large social events or sports events are still the biggest factors when it comes to business in restaurants.
It's not surprising that restaurants continue to face hardships, business reduced 4,8% from the same period of the year as the pressure continues to increase.
The long hot summer has happened right at the worst time for food providers, not knowing in August, when the weather gets better can improve the present situation."
The total increase in businesses in bars and restaurants, including new places open, is 2,7% in July, reflecting resurgence in the development of the trade.

Eilidh Doyle will be "the representative of the athletes" at the Scotland Book Council.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scotland Investigation Council as the director who did not run at the annual meeting of the manager.

An American, who had mastered a 200 - foot - foot - long gold medal in 1996 in Atlanta, he had all four Olympic gold medals, and he was now a direct comment by the psalmist, who couldn't walk after a light ear.
You wrote on Twitter, "A month ago I had a stroke.
I can't go.
The doctors said that there was only time to answer whether I could recover or be in any situation.
It was a tired road, but to fully recover, to learn how to walk, and now I can go back quickly!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
It's a milk - drawn TV that likens mothers to milk that divides online comments.
A milk - feeding company that divides online opinion with a commercial comparing the mothers to the milked cattle.
To mark the output of the product, which is considered "the milk can wear and not cause the first noise in the world," the Evie industry has released an inspirationed commercial from an intelligent music video to show the freedom that the machine will bring to the mothers.
The four mothers jumped in the stables filled with a song that was like, "Yes, I milk my own milk, but you don't see any tails and "In case you don't realize, this isn't my breasts, they're my chest."
Keeping up: "Supply milk, sucking milk, I'm feeding the kids, smoking the milk out, I'm milking my girls."
However, this commercial, published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused many online arguments.
With 71,000 turn and hundreds of comments, this video has received a lot of opposite reaction from audiences, many of the opinion that this commercial is slightly viewed as "the horror" of milk industry.
"A bad decision to use cow for this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and have babies to produce milk, except the cow is taken from the mother cattle in a few days after birth." A writer.
Elvie's milk machine is secretly inside the chest for the baby (Elvie/ Mom)
Another comments: "This could cause mental damage to both mother and child.
Yes, why don't you use the milk machine commercial to the mothers who are feeding their baby?"
Another comments: "This statement has nothing to do with it."
There are people who also protect a commercial, a woman who claims that she's seen a funny song.
"I think this is a unique idea.
I'll have one for myself if I still feed my baby.
It really made me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I understand its message.
This is a unique product," another commenter.
Another comments: "This is an interesting commercial for mothers who need milk (usually at work or in the bathroom) and they feel like "Wolves."
This isn't a credit commercial or an appreciation for milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they had danced with a hidden milk machine hidden in their underwear.
The idea behind this campaign is, in fact, that many women suck milk so that they feel like cattle.
However, the Elvie milker did not cause noise, no rope, or pipes, and lay secretly inside the chest, helping the woman to move freely, holding the baby, and even going out while smoking milk.
Ana Balarin, partners and ECD at Mother comment: "The Evie milk is actually a revolution, worthy of a bold introduction and encouraging curiosity.
When we compare women with milk, we want people to know about milk - drawn products and challenges, and we can be happy and sympathetic about the freedom that new products bring to mothers.
This isn't the first time the Elvie milker appears on the headlines.
During the London fashion week, a mother of two showed up on the front floor of the Marta Jakubowski designer when using this product.
Hundreds of children who enter the country are quietly moving to a camp in Texas border.
The number of prisoners in prison has increased even though the number of monthly borderers has not changed, a portion of the reason and the harsh policies that the government has produced has made the process of bringing children to the donors has become more difficult.
According to tradition, most donors have been immigrants without papers, and they are concerned that accepting a homeless child can affect their ability to stay in the United States.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential donors and other grown-up members of their families would have to take their fingerprints, and this data would be shared with their domestic organs.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Di and Seatic Service, witnessed before Congress that the agency had arrested tens of thousands of people who applied to support teenagers who had no guardians.
The agency then confirmed that 70 percent of those who had never been arrested had a criminal record.
"Well, 80 percent of the donors or members of the donor family are here illegally, and most of them have a criminal record.
So we're continuing to judge these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to the officers who work in the refugees, to be able to handle quickly in connection with these children, officials have made a new rule that requires some donors to appear in court within a month in custody, instead of 60 days after the premises.
Many will appear through a video conference call, instead of directly present, to justify their legal defense before an immigration judge.
Those who are judged are not qualified to receive immediate relief.
Children who are in prison for as long as they become anxious or depressed, this can lead to violent behavior or try to escape, following refugees in the camps and following reports from the system in recent months.
Those who support it say that anxiety increases at a larger facility like Tornillo, where they see a child who is in trouble with more than the size of the camp.
They added that bringing children to a city of refugees without allowing children to have enough time for spiritual preparation or to say goodbye to their friends that can cause mental damage to many children who are suffering.
Syria suggested that the U.S., France, France, and Turkey pull right away from the country.
Speaking before the United Nations Council, Secretary Walid al-Muamle also called for the Syrian refugees to return to the country, although civil war came to the eighth year.
Moualem, Prime Minister, says that foreign forces were on an illegal Syrian land, under the name of the anti-resist force, so "will be treated."
"They had to withdraw from Syria without delay and immediately," he protested in front of the council.
Moualem emphasized that "the war of terrorism in Syria is approaching its end," now over 30,000 people have been dead since 2011, with millions who had to leave their home.
He said Damascus will continue to fight in this holy war until we wipe out terrorist groups from all Syria and "the illegal presence of foreign forces."
There are now about 2,000 men in Syria, training and counseling for both the Kurds and the Arabs who objected to President have al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in the country that are being destroyed by war.
About the refugees, Moualem says that the country conditions that used to be good enough for them to come back, and he blames "some Western countries" has been "supplied with the incomplicated fear" that the refugees didn't return.
"We called for international communities and humanitarian organizations to get refugees back," he said.
"They're using political cards for humanitarian problems."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no Recovering aid for Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposite side to end the war.
The U.N. Foreignist said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey about establishing a neutral area in the last rebel territory of Idlib created an opportunity to promote political negotiations.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has stopped a massive attack on the Russian forces against this province, where three million people are living.
However, Mouale emphasized this agreement with "a specific time" and expressed the hope that military action will target the holy elements including warriors from the Nsra face, who will be deleted.
The U.S. General of the Stafan de Mistura hoped that soon the first gathering of the new committee would include the government and the opposing members to prepare the bill after the war for Syria and open the way for the election.
Moum set the conditions for Syria government participation in this committee, saying that the committee's work is limited only to "see the terms of the current entity" and warned against breaking the election.

Of course, unlike what happened on TV, any of Washington's movements can decide the future of Roe v. Wade, or the union of immigration families and global economic situation.
Only a few television audiences have the right to choose their channels.
Not only so, this draws more attention to information when you get six hours to see a group of experts arguing about using Bob Woodward's "Fear," or the US-Depber-Decreas's US dollar coat, which is a very popular page of the Washington Post, and the ideas found in Stormy Daniels for the president.

He couldn't leave the most television screen, which was when Lagertha Kavangauugh was in the process before the Supreme Court and the future of the Supreme Court were on the table.
"I remember the days when we made those crazy programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss to me.

The money from outside dropped into the election between the most stressful missions for the race into the White House.
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17 election area is witnessing a cash shower, because the reorganization of the Congress area has led you to run into the same chair.
The recent public reorganization in the Kirburg District triggered the Conor Lamb People who had won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb's running with a Republican candidate, Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, in the same area as the new 17th district.
The main map was re-determinated after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts were ordered to cheat in an beneficial direction for the Republicans.
The New 17th district race has become a financial race between the financial organizations of the party, the Democratic Party for Congress and the Republican Party on National War.
Lamb was a familiar name in Pennsylvania after victory over the special election being observed in March for Pennsylvania's 18th district Congress.
This previous position belonged to the Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Melop won 20 points in this district.
Politicians judged the Democratic Party higher.
The United States considered El Salvador’s punishment for supporting China, but then withdrew.
Foreigners noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing, Washington, nearly gave no objection.
President Roop had a meeting with President Juan Carlos Velela of Panama in June 2017 and the president owned a hotel in Panama until business partners fired the administration team of Kappa Reza.
State officials have decided to relive American foreign ministers from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama by "The recent decisions about not accepting Taiwan," Heather Naver, according to the statement of the state of the State Department.
But the punishment for El Salvador, the country, received $800 million dollars in 2017, including drug control, development, and economic support.
The punishments are suggested, including cutting down the financial aid and pharmacy for some of the subjects, which will cause a great damage to the Chinese country now, with a high rate of unemployment and high crime.
When the internal meetings were going on, the North American and Central America officials delayed an international convention focused on security and economic security to reorganization a similar meeting last year was considered an ongoing step in the attempt to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in the middle of September, the high officials declared that they wanted to continue the assembly, helping to end their consideration for El Salvador of the United States.
Foreigners say, Vice President Mike Pence is now planning to speak at the convention, planned in the middle of October when the signal is carried out.
And three U.S. agents were quietly back in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a message or a harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman gave him no comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two foreign officials, who agreed to discuss internal discussions with the condition of name.
Their information has been confirmed by an external analyst who has a close relationship with the government and also speaks anonymously.
Research History
The next bomb could be Robert Mueller's special counselor's report on the behavior of the president of his justice, which has a lot of evidence in his public records.
People think that Mr. Mueller is turning his investigation into a deal of contract between President Kopp with Russia in the presidential election.
If there's a change in the Congress, President Kopp will be in a lot of trouble in Congress, just before the time of the campaign for the election, and even for the same party.
There's a lot of problems, I don't mean to mention the arrival of President Kopp's president.
Both sides of the Atlantic Ocean need to make choices and this will affect the length of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were willing to perform a major campaign against Hitler, if the West also agreed to resist and support the Koran in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter.
History revolves around such molds, and democracy’s harsh struggles will increase or delay.
The Americans have to face some of these molds.
What would happen if President Kopp fired the head of Justice Rodharstein, who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
It's like sitting in a fire since last year's report about the secret of listening to the president and predicting that the president is not fit for office.
Mr. Biblesmanstein reported that the information of the Times was not accurate.
"How would we react if F.B.I.'s new investigation on Kavalaugh was not full or unfair--or if you confirmed to the Supreme Court even though there were trustworthy charges about sexual assaults and dishonesty?
In addition, we're going to vote in the middle of an election for a Congress that's going to force Mr. Kop to take responsibility?
If we fail in these challenges, democracy will lose power for a long time.
But I believe we won't fail, because I have a lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish prostitute who was expelled to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime who occupied our home.
She survived, moved to the U.S. and, 60 years later, she gave me the chance to light candles on the altar on Sabbath.

Graham Dorrans's optimism was on the crew before the encounter with Rapid Vienna
The Providers fought Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the rebellion in Spain in the early Villarreal, would give them the advantage to gain the right to enter the G ring of Ridor League.
The knee wound has stopped the number of live-in-laws from taking up the first time in the season until the two--2 meeting with Villarreal, but I believe that the bats can use that as a floor for more wonderful things.
"That's a good thing for us because Villarreal is a strong team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We've been in the fight with the belief that we're going to get one point.
We were supposed to win at the end of the fight, but the odds were a bad outcome.
They may well have played better in the first round, but we've turned in the second round and there's a better function.
Next Thursday, it'll be an important fight in Europe.
I hope we can win three points, but that's going to be a hard fight because they've had a good outcome in the game before, but with the contrast of the fan, I'm sure we can get through and get good results.
Last year was a difficult time, I was injured and changed at the club, but I now have a very good feeling.
The team's good, the player's got good manners and good practice quality.
I hope we can keep going deeper to reap a successful new season."
Women are so worried that they lose their sleep because of their retirement problem.
Although it is true that the viewers are well - aware of what they care about, few people communicate with family members.
About half the people involved in Nationwide’s research say that they spoke to their wives or husbands about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about this.
"Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about this," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance policy.
These are steps to begin.
Talk to your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your desire first.
Deal with your counselor and family to discuss the location and manner of care, for such choices may be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bringing your financial advisers: Your advisers can also help you make a payment for those costs.
Your financial options for long - term care can include traditional care policy, insurance policy, cash insurance policy, to help cover these costs or buy your own money - as long as you have money.
Prepare well for legal documents: Avoid legal battles that can happen.
There's a plan for health care so that you can assign a reliable individual to monitor the medical care process and make sure that experts obey your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Also, consider your finances.
You should choose a reliable person to make financial decisions for you and make sure you pay your bills if you're not qualified.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your parents had medical emergency and were on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergic reactions?
List those details so you can always be ready.
"Not only financial matters but also doctors?" said Martin.
"What drugs are there?

Federal prosecutors are offering death sentence to the suspect who attacked the NYC terrorist.
The federal prosecutors in New York are offering a death sentence for Sayfullo Dupov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York City killed 8 people - a rare punishment has not yet been committed in this state because of federal crimes since 1953.
Meopov, 30 years old, was supposed to use a truck for Home Depot's rental truck to execute an attack on West Side in the South Manhattan region, crashing into the walker and the bike driver on October 10th.
To justify the death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that the Duppov "dection" kills eight victims and "discreet" causes serious physical wounds, reports on the request for death penalty, delivered in the South New York County.
Both of these charges can be condemned to death, according to the court record.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury accused Dupov with a record of 22 charges of murder, often used by federal prosecutors in organized cases and accused of violence and destruction of the military vehicle.
The attack was called "The Plan and Money," the prosecutors said, when describing the way the Mopov did is "the cruel, cruel, and inhuman."
"Syfullo Habibillavic Duppov was injured, damaged, and lost to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Ralij, Hennnichi, Hern Diego Mendoza, and Alejandrogus" followed the court.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South New York District executed death penalty.
As a result, Khalid Barnes was sentenced to death by two drug providers but eventually sentenced to death in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried on a federal case in New York was in 1953 to have a couple killed after they were convicted as a spy to the Soviet Union two years ago.
Her husband and wife were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Wrongpov, a native of Urx, did not express regret after the attack, according to the court’s document.
He declared to the investors that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Wrongpov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after watching the video of the ESIS on the phone, in the state.
He also asked to hang the ESIS flag in the hospital room, the police said.
He didn't admit a crime for a 22-year-old suspect.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys representing Dupov, said they're "a complete hope" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We think that the decision to execute death sentence instead of accepting a guilty sentence with a life sentence without the ability to launch will only extend the damage of this event to the people involved," said Patton.
The Duppov's defense group had asked the prosecutors not to give a death sentence.

The defender Peter Bone said on the march in Birmingham that the Kingdom of England has come out of the alliance now if Mr. Farage is Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge that Prime Minister May faced as he tried to compromise a profound division between the Communists, supporting the stay of the European Union, was involved in a protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is tight in order to maintain a compromise between attacks from those who support Brexits, those who support and the European Union.
Conscientists claim that she's going to push by trying to get a deal with Jehovah’s people despite severe reaction - and force people of European suspicions and labor parties to choose between her plans and the present-day chaos.
Mr. Bone spoke on Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted'to deal with Cheqers' plan.
He suggested Farage to stay in the Senate and to be responsible for the negotiations with Jehovah’s people.
"If he was responsible, now we might have left the alliance," he said.
Senator Wellingborough adds: "I'm going to support Brexit but we need to object to the Cheqers plan."
He testified his opposition to the European Union: "We don't fight in world wars to submit to others.
We want to build our own law.
Mr. Bone rejected the offer that the opinion has changed since the election in 2016: 'The idea that English people have changed their minds and want to stay in alliances is totally wrong.'
"I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen, listen to the people.
"Not many people agree with the Chequiers plan, the opposite will not vote for this plan, which often doesn't happen to our party, our activist, who's ready to call for support from the people and vote for us from the beginning.
Let's give up the Chequiers plan and listen to the people.'
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: "The generals keep their seat when they keep their promise to the people."
Mr. Farage said that politicians had to participate in protests to accept the heat' if they changed their decision to be given in the Memorial Memorial Memorial of 2016.
"This is a matter of belief between us -- people -- and political class," he said.
'They're trying to give up Brexit and we're here today to say 'We're not going to let you do that'.'
In a message to the supporters, he added: "I want to leave the political class, people who are trying to change Brexit, feel the heat of the present situation.
'We're moving the people, who've brought our victory to Brexiet and we'll never surrender until we become an independent, self-sized English kingdom.'
Meanwhile, those who remained were on the march through Birmingham before they held a two - hour protest in the center of the city.
Some high-ranking activists protested against Brexit after this weekend.
Senator of the Lao Party, Lord Adonis, has made fun of the Communist Party about the security problems they're facing when the opening convention was open.
"These are the people who once told us that they could control CNT and all of the technologies provided for Canada, the free business in Ireland," he added.
"This is a complete joke.
Brexit's not a good thing,' he's adding more.
It's the president's decision.
The United States of Congress, Senator Elizabeth, says you're going to be determined to "the president" after the election in November.
The Boston Globe told the Democratic Party about her future when he spoke at the main court on the west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Mr. Donald Papp, who was rerunning in November in the race with the U.S.A., Geoff Diguro, was the president of the Massachusetts War in 2016.
People thought that she could take care of the location of Kip in 2020.
The fact that happened on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the presidents in the court since the president took office.
One of them asked her about running the president's plan.
It's time for a woman to join politics to reform the government and need to have a woman in the head."

The Grand Prix Prize in Russia: Lewis have won the world's champion after winning ahead of Sebastian Vettel
Valtteri Bottas was clearly more likely to have the advantage than Lewis conducts on Saturday, when the need is still a strong team at the season.
From the start, Bottas had a good start and went ahead to protect his position in the first two races and to make Vettel fight his own team.
Vettel was in the first pit and abandoned him on his way back into the race, a decisive action.
It's going to the back of Vettel, but it's up front by the racer on the latest that's forced to reduce the speed to avoid the risk after two blocks to protect the third position.
Max Verstappian began at the back of the race and about the seventh position when it ended up on his 21st birthday.
Later, he took the lead in the race when he did not change his tires to quickly return to Kimi Raikonen to win the fourth position.
He was finally in the 44th race but couldn't speed up in the remaining eight rounds when Raikonen won the fourth position.
It's a tough race because Valtteri's been fighting very well at the end of the weekend, and it's a really good race.
Finally, the team had a great race to win number one and two, "Hamilton says.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Supp made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at the Saturday campaign because she insisted that she didn't leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about the high court charges in the sexual attack on Lavaauugh.
In the campaign on West Virginia, the president was not directly targeting the public published by Ford in front of the Senate, instead of saying that what's going on in the Senate shows that people have bad and dishonest intentions.
"There's something going on and what's going on in the last few days at the Senate is wonderful, you can feel anger, you can see people angry, bad, and not honest," said the President.
"When they watch the articles and read the leaks and they say, "Well, I'm not the one who did it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked the news, didn't you?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document, didn't you? "Oh, my God, what's going on?
No, no.
I don't leak."
Now, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't do that," said the Senator.
Feinstein was sent to give detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that her office leaked information.
"I don't hide the charges from Dr. Ford, I don't leak her story, "Feinstein said to the committee, Hill delivered the news.
"She asked me to keep a secret and I kept it as she asked."
But the president seemed unhappy about her refusing behavior and he had comment on the seventh night campaign: "I'm going to tell you about that, which is actually a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continues to protect the Supreme Court's candidate, who has been accused of sexual abuse, the president says that democracy is using charges for his own purpose.
"They are determined to gain power in any way.
You're going to see the meaning and pain because they don't care who they're going to hurt, they want power and control," Mediaite led the president.

We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he stopped breathing before the plane reached Palu.
"Our heart broke when we received this message," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities were afraid that the number of the dead could go to thousands, and the spokesmans of the nation’s low natural disaster told them how difficult it was to reach the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The number of dead people continue to increase because many bodies are still trapped under the ruins and we haven't been able to reach a lot of people," said Mr. Surgo Porwow Ngroho, the speaker of this agency.

Air Niugini said there was a missing man after a plane crash at the beach.
The flight dropped at the Pacific Coast in Micronesia said that there was still a missing man, after saying that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the crashing plane.
Air Niugini said in an announcement that, until Saturday afternoon, we couldn't find a male passengers.
The bank did not say that working with local institutions, hospitals, and researchers was trying to find a man.
The queue didn't answer immediately, for example, asking for further information on passengers, such as age or nationality.

On Friday, officials said that seven were sent to the hospital.
The clients didn't say that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the accident and the precise chain of events is still unknown.
The U.S. and the Navy all said the plane landed at the beach right after leaving the ice.
Some witnesses think that the plane is missing the ice.
American passengers Bill Jaynes said the plane was low.
"This is a good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others could go through deep water to reach the emergency exits on the planes.
He said that the passengers didn't panic and scream, and he had a slight trauma on his head.
The U.S. Navy says that the sailors who worked nearby when repairing the port also helped to rescue by using the boat to pick up the people on the shore before the plane was about 30 feet [30 m] deep.
The data from the communal security network doesn't show that 111 people died in the accident of non-repressed restaurants in the PNG network for the last two decades, but there's no case with Air Niugini.
The analysis says the time on the night that the girl was burned alive
A man who was accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The editor of the U.S. Ministry of Justice Paul Chemistett has been witnessing in court for hours as an intelligence analyst.
He showed the jury how to use the mobile record to combine the process of moving by Quinton Tellis, 21st and Jessica Chambers' victims, 19-year-old her dead night.
Knewett said that he had received his location data from some mobile phone that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the evening she died, conflicts with his earlier statement, Clarion Ledger.
Data shows that his cell phone was at the same location with Chambers' phone for the time he said he was with a friend named Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford witnessed to court on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another conflicting detail is Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The cell phone records show that they only know each other for about a week.
Rowett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted messages, calls and communications from Chambers' phone.
"He wiped you out of his life," said Haley.
The attorney's excuse began secret arguments on Sundays.
The judge said he expected the jury's trial that day.
What's a positive hip?
Three artists want to object to negative views of this kind by bringing positive messages into their music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, declared hip hop has no longer transmitted political messages and solved social problems.
The group wants to take this kind of thing back to the right source and spread it back into the positive hip.
Recently artists like the Fugees and Common have been more famous in England thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
FEAR NY warned the couple that they had fired you after the "Secree" message.
A mother in New York Nanny accused a couple of having fired her because of the difference she was treated after she received a false message from her mother complaining that she was "a black man."
The couple refused them to be racialists, considering the case as a "finish" case.
Lyra Plusco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed discouragement when she discovered the new baby, Gibbons, who was black on the first day she came to get a job in 2016.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent it twice.
After realizing the mistake, Miss Plsco-Flaxman had fired her, she said that the African mother was about to quit doing something bad and that she hoped that she had a younger sister who was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, according to New York Post.
She was paid by day and went to Uber home.
Now, she's starting to sue the couple for ecclesiastical behavior with a $350 payment a day in six months for the job she was hired to receive money even though they didn't sign any contract.
"I want to show them, look, she can't do things like this," she said to the Post on Friday, and she added, "I know that's the difference."
The couple had opposed the charges that they were racialists, saying that the end of the job was reasonable because they couldn't trust her after they had offended her.
"My father sent her a message she didn't intend to send.
She's not a racialist.
We're not racialists," the husband Joel Plasco said to the Post.
"But can you give your child to someone you offended, even the mistake?
What about the new baby?
Say it."
In comparing the case with a "supert," Plco says that his wife has been born for two months and is in a very difficult situation."
"How would you deal with someone like that?
This isn't one thing to do," said the invester.
While the legal case was taking place, the audience’s opinion quickly pointed to the couple’s nose on social media, ignoring their behavior and the logic of the story.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the reader would not be interested in the story of a well-known bear, the letter said.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, was born just after the book was widely accepted by the reader, the letter revealed: "It was hard to put yourself in the position of others when reading the book for the first time was published.
It's great that we now know about the great success of Paddington."
When he spoke of his father, a filmer to the mentions of the events before he was inspired to write a book for children from a small toy bear, he still felt optimistic when his work was rejected, she shared in the Memorial 60 years of publishing the book, which was a "dwelling and fun" after his death last year.
When she spoke about Paddington, she described as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was always proud of his success.
"You're a pretty depressed man, and you're not a man who's a working man," she said.
"But because Paddington actually exists with him, it's almost like you have a child and it's got certain successs: you're proud of them even when they don't exist.
I think you've been watching Paddington's work that way.
Although it was the product of his creation and his imagination, he always won a certain position for Paddington."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
As soon as she landed her daughter, she was quickly moved to Louis Pashao 2 at Nice, where doctors tried to save her life but in vain.
"I often called Nad to say this was bad and she didn't have to be like that," said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad said she'd stop breathing for two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Ishi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you soon.
I'll always be with you.
The doctors pumped the heart support and pulled the tube out of her body.
She stopped breathing a few times and this is the last time.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing this is not closed.
I can't cry or cry or cry because I'm with my family and everyone.
I must be the one who's attached them."
Finally, Miss Ednan-Laprouse, who is still grieving by her daughter's departure, was on board with other passengers with the challenge she would have to overcome.
"No one knows," she said.
"I bow and cry all the time.
It was hard to explain, but when I was on my flight I felt sorry for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much she loves her."
A sad woman postponing a post to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their freedoms trying to stop people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have published cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms. Davis’s son, Tyler, was 13 years old and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to be in the feeling that I have to go through every day," she said.
Davis, age 45, lives in Lydney, says that her son was a promising chef with a smile full of laughter.
"Everyone knows about it for that smile.
They used to say his smile lights up every room."
However, he left his job before he killed himself because he felt he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s older brother, who was 11 years old, left just like his brother after the end of his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I keep worrying that there's gonna be a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis designed cards, "to let people know that there's always people that you can meet, talk, or even make friends.
Don't live in silence - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davies's for many years, lost Mark, his partner 15 years ago, soon after his mother's death.
"He's not talking about feeling boring or disappointed or anything like that," she said.
"And a few days before Christmas, we found him changing his attitude.
He's got a boring mood on Christmas -- when the kids open their gifts and he doesn't want to keep an eye on them or anything around him."
She said that her husband's death was a great loss to them, but they still had to try to get through: "This has caused a big breach in our family.
It breaks our hearts.
But we all continue to live and fight it."

The future of Jock Kavanaugh is hanging when the FBI starts to investigate.
Mr. Folke said on Saturday, "I think, if we can actually get something like what he asked -- a time-term investigation, the limit of the range, we can collect a little bit," he added that he was afraid that the committees would be "employed" of the party.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and the Republicans want the FBI to investigate?
Their delay is just a matter of time.
The annual elections, on November 6th -, if, as expected, the Republicans are in a very bad situation that will be even more vulnerable in trying to find the representative who they want to vote in the highest position.
George W. Bush called the senators, took the lobby to support Mr. Kavalaugh, who was the white house assistant in the days of President Bush, who was able to reach his wife, Ashley, who was the personal secretary of President of the President of the United States.
What happened after the FBI announced reports?
There's gonna be a vote in the Senate, where 51 of the Republicans and 49 of the Democratic Party.
Now it's not clear if Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes from the Senate, which allows Mike Pence, now the vice president, to remove the button and confirm the position of the candidate in the Supreme Court.
The number of Koreans escape from the power of Mr. Kim.
The number of Koreans has fallen from the time Kim Jong-un has been in power seven years ago, a contractor in Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted data from the Korean union last year, said there were 1,127 escapes - compared to 06 escapes in 2011.
Mr. Park says that tight control of the border between North Korea and China and the vast majority of the traffickers are the main elements of this change.
Piccich did not make public comments.
Most escapeers from North Korea have finally been elected to Korea.
Seoul says that more than 40,000 North Koreans have been outlawed since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most fugitives fled to China, the most long-term nation with North Korea, and they could easily cross the Navy.
China views fugitives as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forces them to return home.
The relationship between North Korea and South Korea is still in recent months.
Early in this month, the leaders of two countries met in PFO to have negotiations focused on atomic problems.
These actions took place after the historical meeting in June between the President of the United States and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, both agreed with the expansions to reach the Korean subcontinent nuclear Republic.
But on Saturday, the Secretary of North Korea, Riong-Hing-H made a mistake on American punishments that caused a delay in the process.
"If there's no belief in the United States, there's no belief in our national security, and in that case, there's no other way that we're going to find a solution for ourselves," said Mr. Ri in a statement at the United Nations Council in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Ulrich Kavalaugh "the dead are too excited," and said that he was not fit for the position at the Supreme Court.
The third Catholic leader Nancy Pelosi called the man who was elected for the position at the Supreme Court, U.S. Kavanaugh was "a very encouraging part" and said that he was temporarily inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi comments on a interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help, but I think if a woman did that, they'd call it "the dead body," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavangh's testimony before the Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavaaugh insisted on refusing charges that he had attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while both of them were teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh revealed a lot of emotions, and there were times when he almost cried out and was embarrassed when he spoke about his family and five months in high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democratic Party before the committee, calling the charges against him as an act of "expectedly planned" because U.S.R. was lost in the election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony had proved that he was not fit for the position at the Supreme Court, for he was clearly acting against the Democratic Party.
"I think that he removed his position by giving his statements and his treatment when he talked about the family of the Clinton and the Democratic Party," she said.
Pelosi refused to ask if she tried to accuse Kavalaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democratic Party won the majority of votes in the House.
"I'm going to say this--if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI, he's not only at the Supreme Court where he has to work in court," said Pelosi.
Kavalaugh is now a judge at the D.C.
Pelosi adds, as a democracy member, she cares about Kavalaugh's ability to make a decision against law of health care, money, or Roma, because he's considered a security judge.
In the hearing, Kavanaugh escaped the question about whether he would change some decision made by the Supreme Court.
"This isn't the time for a man who's too excited, in position in court, and hopefully we'll say, 'This isn't amazing,' said Pelosi.
Women need to know for themselves.
It's a really serious criticism, a month over the next month, and years of anger is getting bigger, and she can't get over without crying.
"We cried when we were angry," said Miss Steinem to me after 45 years.
"I don't think that's unusual, and you?"
She continued, "I've been a very helpful woman, and she's a senior director, and she says she's also crying when she's angry but to make a reaction when she's angry and she starts to cry, she'll tell the person she just said, "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And you keep crying.
And I think this is great."
You are allowed to cry for this behavior to be part of an escape for anger because they are basically being misreaded.
One of my most profound memories of working in the company was that it was a place for men, and I had been crying when there was a violent rage, which was when I was being struck by an old woman -- it was the colder who always made me feel afraid -- had dragged me into the stairs.
You said to me, "Don't let them see you crying."
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy because they're with you."
No, she was later a Democratic princess in Colorado who worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an immoral boat called Mdon Business and left the race, she was deeply disappointed, saying that there was no reason why she could not stand up for the president.
30 years later she laughed and said to me, "It's not a good decision."
"There are seven other candidates in the race, and they need another candidate.
Someone called this race "The Snow White and the Seven Book."
By taking part in the campaign, she was lost in an fundraiser operation, so she swore that she wouldn't be in the campaign unless she took two million dollars.
The war has failed.
She found that some of her supporters gave you 250 dollars instead of 1,000 dollars to support the male candidate.
You ask yourself, "Do they think I'm down?"
When she announced that she would not launch an official campaign, she had overcome her emotions -- expressing appreciation for those who supported her, disappointed with the difficult system for the funding process and targeting the candidates rather than the delegates, she was angry with the sex distinction -- that she was immediately at the top of the box.
"You can think that I've been nervous," she recalls, recalling how the press had responded to me.
"You thought Kleenex was my company's donor.
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my tombstone?
"Do you cry?"
The American commercial war could be a good signal for Beijing.
Experts say, the opening wings for the trade war between America and China have been in danger, and the war will continue, the breach between nations can be an advantage for Beijing.
Early this year, Donald Zep, president of the United States, gave the first warning by paying taxes of Chinese exports, including solar, steel, and aluminum.
More and more in recent weeks, with a 200 billion dollars [50 billion] dollars [50 billion] spent on half of China's goods to import into the United States.
Beijing has paid off taxes from five to ten percent to 60 billion dollars of American goods.
China's commitment to revenge corresponds to the actions of the United States and the second largest economy in the world can hardly be swept away soon.
Getting Washington in uniform means that Beijing has to offer the demands, but publicly losing before the United States is too ashamed to Mr. President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing is able to produce proper flags, long-term forces of commercial war with the United States can be a positive signal to China by reducing the differences of two economics.
"The fact is that a political decision in Washington or in Beijing can all begin an economic relationship in one of two countries, and this is really more dangerous than what was previously accepted," said Abigail Grace, an expert in Asia at the New America Security Center, giving comments.
Syria's ready to return to the refugees, Minister of State.
Syria said that they were ready for volunteers to return and were calling for help to rebuild the country by the war for more than seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations Council, Secretary Walid al-Muamle said that conditions in this country are being improved.
"Today, the national situation is stable and safer because of the progress in the war of terrorism," he said.
The government continues to correct areas that are destroyed by terrorists to restore life conditions.
