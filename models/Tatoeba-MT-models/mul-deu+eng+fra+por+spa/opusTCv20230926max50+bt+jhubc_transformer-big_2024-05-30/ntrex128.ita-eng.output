Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned about "making the figure of the paliators"
There is consternation among some members of the Assembly in the face of the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This proposal was made as a result of the programmes to change the name of the Assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the whole political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Assembly said his party was concerned that "it could rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who do not live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means crap.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said the group as a whole was "unhappy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said it was "open" to change the name, but pointed out that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet.
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is pronounced in a manner similar to the English pronunciation of Yorkshire of the letter U.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing for the introduction of the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of how the members of the Assembly will be called will of course be a subject of debate for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed broad support for the possibility of calling the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of members of the Assembly, the Commission expressed its preference in favour of Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option received more consent in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could be a big hit for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include further amendments to the functioning of the Assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians go to polls for referendum on country name change
On Sunday voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to end a decades-long dispute with the bordering Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its requests for accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opposition to the name-change plebiscite, said he would not consider the result of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent while the churches of Harlem are in trouble
“The elders I talked to say that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
"There's none of them today."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood lounges that people frequent regularly."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money resulting from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people that will not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he says, “and for that reason they will be hiring the time when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will become a member of these churches.”
Both churches were built by confraternities before Harlem became a black neighborhood - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The initial white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of 125th Street retailers, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote people of color.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as Father Johnson's parishioners planned its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stressed that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a colored musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at the church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been staged at St. Martin’s in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by the church’s lay leaders, others from the diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of laity leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese was "trying to pay the costs" on the parish assembly although the latter was not involved in the parish assembly.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures Thirteen-Year-Old Dive In California
Officials say on Saturday a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy as he was diving in California looking for cucumbers during the opening day of the cucumber season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego’s KSWB-TV that for half an hour he was drowning with friends Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming and swam up to him with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was only enthusiasm due to catching a spider, but then "he realized that the boy was yelling, 'I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
His whole clavicular was lacerated," he said he noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles said during a news release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been declared not belonging to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper thoracic area.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's program a push towards the UK beauty products industry
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with courses dedicated to the beauty products of the large warehouse assigned to specialist assistants
As part of the key push towards the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty product market, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and home goods sectors decline, the largest courses dedicated to beauty products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and adopted in more successive stores next year.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting for new ways to use space on shelves once dedicated to TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its beauty product offering to reach 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique tricks so that most of the products are vegan – an increasingly demanding quality from younger buyers.
In addition, fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will experience authorizations in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at small neighborhood stores have forced supermarkets to engage more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses as the supermarket chain tries to resist discounts like Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat since it bought the two chains about two years ago, and this strategy has boosted food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to return enamel to its beauty and pharmaceutical products departments ended in a failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenue from pharmaceutical outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business of 281 stores three years ago to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four stores of an extensive range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the appearance of our beauty products departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and convenient positions make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby kicks off <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is angry after TV presenter Holly Willoughby resigned from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with her brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby no longer has time for his brand of housewives and accessories True.
The couple's activity was compared to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow's.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter has filed for Instagram to announce her resignation.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den star Peter Jones angry after retiring from their profitable last-minute brand activity to focus on her new exceptional contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "furious" when the golden girl on TV admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of her commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - for a value of 1.5 million pounds - did not leave her enough time to access their homes and martyrs.
The activity was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop's Goop brand Goop and it was estimated that it would double Willoughby's assets, estimated at around <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As soon as 37-year-old Willoughby chose Instagram to announce his departure from True, Jones left Britain to head for one of his vacation residences.
According to a source, “Truly was without a doubt Holly’s top priority.
It had to be her long-term future that would have engaged her for the next twenty years.
His decision to leave has left all the people involved absolutely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow's headquarters, ready to be sold."
Experts believe the abandonment of This Morning, one of the UK’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to strong investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and due to possible delays in launching the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby conceived True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couple spent the holidays together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity" program.
A source close to Jones said last night that he "doesn't want to release comments on his business."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media to make a comment that some would consider “non-presidential” and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the "tele-journalist".
"I didn't give up anything."
He stressed that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a huge step forward towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
But the negotiations for denuclearization are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, which North Korea did not observe an "equivalent response" from the US to North Korea's first disarmament operations.
Instead, he stressed, the U.S. is continuing to impose sanctions aimed at keeping pressure high.
Trump has given a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"With North Korea we are getting great results," he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of the missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages, and the return of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
“It’s simple to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded camp, we’d have about 200 people right here in front of us,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, causing hundreds of deaths
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, NGOs were notified that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had been displaced, the national emergency had not been declared, an essential requirement for activating international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a bit complicated," he said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will go to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Considering the earthquakes to which Indonesia is constantly subjected, the country continues to be terribly unprepared to the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common structure on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami alarm siren in Palu, although the alarm was given, has probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
In the best conditions, moving between the numerous islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has placed at the center of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia’s brandle infrastructure and has spent money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds hit Joko's administration as he prepares for re-election next year.
Joko is also faced with pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been removed from their homes due to clashes on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs, fighting with machetes, arches and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool matches against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea by a point in the 89th minute on Saturday, at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 metres from Chelsea's goal, with his team down for 1-0.
He hit the left ball before pulling on the second pole.
The attempt went high above the door frame as it turned to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga’s shoulder and plunged into the net.
"I just wanted to get in position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always playing forward as much as I can, so I tried to create myself for as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante arrive and I gave him a touch and I didn't think too much about it and I pulled it."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first time after the goal in the 25th minute scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blue's midfielder passed to Mateo Kovacic before slipping away near half the field and shooting in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick half-field pass.
So he made a beautiful pass that brought Hazard to the area.
Hazard surpassed the defense and finished second with a left goal over Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League round at 15.00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the country's disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
Numerous people have been reported trapped in the debris of buildings collapsed following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Friday and generated waves up to 6 meters high, Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman is beaten to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman’s body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have invited people who may have seen or heard something in the area to get in touch.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just beginning, but I would like to make an appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard something suspicious and invite them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashcam, so that they can contact us because they may have very important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found resides in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about the location of the discovery this morning.
Investigations are underway and police said they are currently informing the victim’s family members.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment but was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were informed that it would take hours before they were allowed to return.

Anyone with information about this is invited to contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 indicating register 247 dated 30 September.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the wave of "rewriting history"
His removal would be poetic justice for his destruction by the Taliban of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has called Crick’s proposal a “crazy” and an “try to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in light of the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace became a target.
Iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was not ordered or conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell has been considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament from external pressures, in his case of course of the monarchy.
That this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure representing part of such a fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
Pig kills Chinese farmer by killing him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the nickname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery, covered with blood near a porch at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from the bordering province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby porch was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the porch with blood on the muzzle.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 kg pig had scrambled the breeder, according to the statements.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and stained," the cousin identified with the nickname "Wu", as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told Evening News that the pig was detained to prevent it from attacking other people, while the police collected evidence on the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the farmer's death.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig stuck a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba breeder told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a “catalyst.”
“They just want to play.
They are playful, very curious .... they don't want to hurt.
It is enough to show them the right dose of respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Pink slopes will bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rain over northern Mexico and the southwestern coast of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane at 5 p.m. ET on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a sack is forming on the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the western coast of the US. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push a strong tropical humidity northward, in the southwestern part of the USA.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
So, the tropical moisture in contact with the approaching sack will create heavy and extensive rainfall in the southwestern area in the coming days.
At the local level, between 2 and 10 cm of rain can cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and possible debris in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at some points, particularly in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitations of 2.5-10 cm of rain are expected in some areas of the southwest, particularly in much of Arizona.
It is possible that sudden flooding occurs with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised not to venture in the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could make the river canyons full, and the tidals will bring wind to bubbles and suffocate dust.
The approaching sack will cause heavy local rains on part of the southern California coast.
Precipitations of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of debris and slippery tracks.
This would be the first rainfall in the region in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona towards the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more extensive at the end of Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rains will descend on the Four Corners on Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be strong temperature fluctuations in the US as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain warm enough.
Sometimes this leads to significant temperature changes over short distances.
An exceptional example of sensitive temperature differences in the central U.S. will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining heat of summer will try to increase and expand again.
It is expected a warm beginning in October for most of the central and eastern U.S., with 26 degrees Celsius from the Southern Plains to northeastern areas.
In New York, you can reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecasts indicate strong odds of above-average temperatures for the eastern United States until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audience
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the appealing deposition by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would have happened in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with broadcasters interrupting the regular schedule for a last-minute turn on Friday: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford has informed the Senate Justice Commission that it is 100% certain that Kavanaugh slapped her in a state of drunkenness and tried to empty her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, during an inflamed deposition, said he was 100% certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen on Friday followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting the spectators who follow the programs in the offices.
To put everything in perspective, it’s an audience similar to that for a football playoff game or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose viewers strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement stating that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning as he was being insulted by demonstrators while trying to take an elevator to a Commission hearing.
He remained low-eyed for several minutes as he was being prosecuted and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power while a lot of women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued the statement and stated, before the elevator closes, that he would have other things to say during the committee hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would do so only with the certainty that the FBI would analyze the charges against the candidate over the following week, as requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May Accuses Critics of ‘Making Politics’ on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused those who criticise his programs of letting the European Union "political face" with Britain's future and jeopardizing national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside the prime minister on the first page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers Brexit deal, stating that a proposal that Britain and the EU should "recover their respective sums of money" is
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Suspect of LSU Player Dyteon Simpson's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on second-degree murder charges, Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities have released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson’s DNA on them, reports WAFB television station affiliated with CBS.
After interrogating Simpson, police said the suspect admitted to accidentally shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at <0x24>350,000, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge law firm issued a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of the death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the task force for the fugitives of the Louisiana State Police, the police science lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of the LSU thanked the area order forces for their commitment and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "distorted" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This is what you worry about at all times,” Wade said.
Vulcan ash crawling Mexico City
The ash that escapes from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity had increased in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was controlling the various rockets and shakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity corresponding to the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Mexico’s central area in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-smoke police teams and thousands of people joined opposition demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists hampered by the anti-smoke police targeted policemen with eggs and threw paint into dust, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that usually roam tourists.
There were further clashes over the course of the day with police officers who resorted to the manganeses to contain the fight.
For several hours, the groups of independents who sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" confronted the unionist demonstrators who shouted "Long life to Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
Tensions remain high in the independentist region one year after the October 1 referendum considered illegal by the Madrid government but recognized by Catalan separatists.
The voters had voted with a crushing majority for independence, although the influx was low, and Catalans opposed to secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people reported injuries last year after police tried to stop the referendum that was taking place in seats across the region with violent clashes.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents cry with joy for the chance to vote, but now everything is blocked,” he said.
Although they have achieved a fundamental victory although in measure in the regional elections of last December, the Catalan independentist parties have struggled to maintain the momentum this year, with many of the movement’s most well-known leaders who find themselves in a voluntary exile or in prison awaiting succession in the organ of judgment and referendum for their role in the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both factions.
“The situation is increasingly tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since late last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Presenting me as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the revolution of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested After Smashing a House With a Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly hitting a Londonderry house in a car.
The accident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, at approximately 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit with a ballast at some point.
Menga's Attack Signs Livingston's 1-0 win against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston signed the win
The already promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as Ibrox club director.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference while Gary Holt's team moved to the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerrard’s team is thus left without a home win in the Premiership this season and will face Hearts firsts next Sunday, from which they are separated by 8 points.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted the Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues its series of victories in the division remaining unbeaten for six games, with coach Holt still seeing a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston Waste Opportunity Against Low-Incisive Guests
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the goal, with their immediacy that caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson slipped but pulled his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow was only able to kick out the door after entering to meet Craig Halkett's head shot from the other side of the door.
The guests were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could have made it difficult for visitors with balls placed.
This is how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers conceded a penalty kick and the Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to pass to Menga, which he was able to score from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball but the host team's defense had proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly hadn't had to worry too much.
This scheme was maintained during the second time, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow made a shot out of another Livingston game scheme.
The crosses took place in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two demands for rigor, after Halkett's contrast with deputy Glenn Middleton and one by hand, were rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont at BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for the Livingston.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their style of play and staff have changed very little since their return to the top of the series, but you have to give a lot of credit to Holt for the way he managed to push the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, head of a masterly organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were little inspired.
Despite the excellent performance at some point with Gerrard, in this case they went well below such standards.
The last step was missed - only once they managed to penetrate the opponent area - and you can consider an alarm bell for the Rangers, who are half-ranked.
Erdogan received with contrasting reactions to Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at extending relations between NATO allies.
They met on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest group of Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have for security reasons motivated the intervention to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect the dissent caused by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks of Germany and called a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car collision in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeastern area of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived on the spot, but the man died on the shot.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist was killed, invested by a street pirate in Childers Street, about a mile from where the accident occurred on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the authorities were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses were diverted and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured During Disorder
Six prison guards were wounded during a riot at the highest-security male prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin, Worcestershire’s top-security male prison at 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialized agents "Tornado" have been employed to manage the riot, which involves eight prisoners and which is confined to a prison wing.
Agents were treated on-site for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to contain an incident currently ongoing at Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer prison term.”
The Long Lartin prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had to receive hospital care following the attack on a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-smoke agents were called to intervene in prison to seize a violent riot during which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Pink threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which could benefit areas affected by drought)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but it is exactly what will likely happen at the beginning of next week when the last energies of Hurricane Rosa will cross the southwest of the desert, creating a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday evening with rain.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with peaks isolated up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will receive from 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks up to 10 cm.
For areas outside the risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing as the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these precipitations will likely be positive as the southwestern area is currently undergoing a drought period.
According to the drought monitoring center, just over 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category," said weather.com.
Initially, the route of Hurricane Rosa will be able to land steady through Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, which still maintained hurricane force on Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with the coldest waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected to arrive in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or Monday evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"It is expected to rain between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the northwestern zone of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with a state of tropical depression, then heading north through Arizona and toward southern Utah in the late evening of Tuesday.
"The main risk that can be caused by Rosa or its scrapes are intense rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora area and the southwestern desert area of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that such rains can generate sudden potentially lethal flooding and debris flows in the desert, as well as swamps on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 04:00 BST about Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Authorities have appealed to anyone who may have picked up on the phone what happened.
Trump Says Kavanaugh "has suffered for the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and overwhelming tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered for the badness and anger” of the Democratic Party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, passionately denying and decisively Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual violence against her decades ago, when she was still a teenager.
Ford also deposed in the hearing defending himself against the charge.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people were able to observe the extraordinary quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most expert legal minds of our time, a lawyer with unprecedented public service records,” he said in front of a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment, speaking of the importance of Republican influence in midterm elections.
"Five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm really going to do it," he said.
"For this batch strenuously for exceptional candidates."
Trump said Democrats are committed to “resisting and obstructing.”
The first crucial procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to CNN’s senior assistant at the GOP.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami, and the death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by giant waves that crashed on the beaches when a large earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) fell on the beach in the dusk, sweeping away numerous people killing them and destroying anything along their way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and they weren't running away immediately, thus turning into victims," Indonesian disaster control agency BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, it hit anything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved in the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people have climbed trees to escape the tsunami and have survived, he explained.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the disaster agency showed numerous buildings and shops destroyed, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The siege shocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was seen in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's heavy earthquake was almost 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have enhanced the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extreme" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the debris of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were displaced.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the 300 km (190 miles) coast north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, nearest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "have been totally paralyzed, with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living in the area," the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the areas involved.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had struck Palu, although authorities said the waves had arrived at the time the alarm had been launched.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you hear a man on the upper floor of a building screaming agitated way to warn people of the coming tsunami on the street below.
A few minutes after a wall of water fell on the beach, tearing away buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive blackout that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to the authorities, the army began sending cargo aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still need food and other first-hand goods.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescue and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia’s tsunami death toll rises to more than 800.
It's terrible.
Although the World Vision staff in Donggala managed to reach the city of Palu, where employees took refuge under ceramic canvas coverings in their office courtyard, they encountered scenes of devastation during the trip, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's terrible.
Even as the rescue teams started the difficult operations to start the rescue gears, there have been some complaints about the fact that foreign rescue workers with extensive knowledge have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
Indonesian regulations provide that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to arrive if the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘O.K., this is a national disaster,’ we will be able to accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined.”
On the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of the displaced still kept the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was taken out of a drain.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the garbage for two days with her mother’s body next door.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the paragliding drivers were missing.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As a veteran in the paragliding industry, I am carrying my emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel within the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors, who were attending the beach festival.
His messages, however, stopped at a single gray pointer instead of two blue signs.
“I think it means that the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal <0x24>26,750 during an ATM delivery to Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying an ATM in the entertainment center and was preparing to deliver another money, investigator Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “was slapped behind Brink’s employee’s shoulder” and stole a bag with the money destined for delivery.
Some witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the crime scene, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the identity of the offenders is invited to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
In announcing Saturday the name change on Twitter, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye and has used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change occurred before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West previously stated that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yee' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, talking about the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We have passed from Kanye, which means the only, simply Ye - the reflection of our goodness, our evilness, our confusion, of everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are.”
It is just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also changed his name with or without spelling and capital letters.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against the civilian population, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "never use the army to repress the Mexican people."
The soldiers had shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening up more public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of training opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its research funds in this field, says IA investor and operator Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of various U.S. government groups about AI, although in the U.S. there is generally a lack of a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its program last year: aims to be the No. 1 country in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget in AI research would be a good start considering that all other countries are far behind the US and we need a new revolution in AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the likelihood that the next big AI success will be achieved in the U.S., Lee told CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat Otello’s American player with the highest score and was then executive at Microsoft Research and chairman of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled previous U.S. government technology contests such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one will be held to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get funds from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking away academic leaders, it's the multinationals," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaires from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to graduates in AI,” he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its program for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Foundation for Sciences and other government organizations distribute funds to U.S. researchers, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at involving industrial partners and universities, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, the U.S. order to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not registered activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on a possible change of the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its neighbors constitutes a claim on its territory and vetoed Macedonia’s entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would damage the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts about the possibility that the influx would reach the minimum 50% necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum card is as follows: "It agrees with NATO and EU membership and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is the price to be paid so that Macedonia can be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the emerging countries since the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of Parliament have stated that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it final.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in a row.
The state electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 13:00.
However, the influx was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters had expressed their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an elector of the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted for the Macedonian referendum on the country’s name change that would open the door to NATO and the European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and arranging the chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We’re for NATO and the EU, but we want to get in high, not for the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80% of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would have participated in the referendum - a percentage below the required influx.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV indicated that 57% of respondents planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of those 57%, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the influx must be 50% plus a vote.
A failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to the government’s policy since it settled in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scores a goal by avoiding Brighton's entire defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of Brighton's defense during the 2-0 win from Manchester City at Manchester's Etihad Stadium in England on Saturday.
Aguero made it seem extremely easy to score at the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a half-field pass at the start of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting himself on the open field.
Aguero was then found surrounded by four green shirts.
He humiliated a defender before overcoming several others at the Brighton area limit.
He then made a left turn, where he found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat the Brighton Mathew Ryan goalkeeper with a shot to the right in the net.
"Aguero is having foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about making him play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was able to score at the time.”
But it was Sterling who initially brought the Sky Blues to the advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal reached the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in depth on the Brighton field.
He sent a nice filter ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues attacker pulled the ball into the net just before leaving the field.
The City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League round at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But as always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which keep an advantage of a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have won at least one catch with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to get their title in the first division.
"Although we play without a goal, we can at least be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level this year.
“Why should I not want to compete?”
The Nationals still have to announce a first launcher for Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to let Scherzer launch in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first launcher for the 34th time, held a launch session on Thursday and would be the first launcher in his normal resting Sunday.
The Washington pitcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings for this season.
Trump at a meeting in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the influx of Republicans in midterm elections.
“Everything we did was put into play in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate but I'm really going to do it for this, I'm battling for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “We see this horrible group of radical Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you can see evil, messiness.
They don’t care who they can hit, who they have to overwhelm to be able to regain power and control, because that’s what they want, power and control, and we won’t give them.”
Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of "resisting and obstructing."
"And it has been possible to see it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "raged, bad, messy and liars."
He referred to the Senate Justice Commission with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, triggering strong cracks among the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you get the paperwork?
Uh, uh, what.
No, um, no, I'm waiting for one - that was a bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
It does not tolerate people who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, it was not a big surprise.
After all, they are the last of a series of Labour MPs to whom it was reported that they were not welcome, and all because they said what they were thinking.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because he strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all issues similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the meeting of the Nottingham East Labour on Friday stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a member of the local Labour Party’s parliament, Friday evening meetings were exactly like that.
However, today this is not the tone of numerous meetings and the promise of a "more kind and courteous" policy has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged based on whether or not it is acceptable for party leadership.
This all began shortly after Jeremy became the head of the party, and colleagues with whom I previously thought to share a similar political vision began to expect a reversal of trend on my part and to take positions that I would never accept, whether it be national security or the single market.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - they follow invectives of social media insults calling for my withdrawal, denouncing the policy of the centre and saying that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than my other colleagues, since the comments made to me tend to be political in nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a stream of insults from a sexist or racist background every day but who do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of the levels of insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of distrust or modification of the selection rules, the party narrows itself.
Over the past two years I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower my head, not to express my opinions so openly and everything "would have gone well".
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the government’s incursion that had left my secondary school class literally falling apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as local councillor or government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused by my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will damage our family, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in reality the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of those I think are your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unbeaten Ayr scales the ranking
Two late attempts may somehow have imbalanced the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved the triumph in this exceptionally fun Tennent championship day game.
I'm now at the top of the rankings, the only team out of ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "It is necessary to recognize Ayr's merit, they have taken better advantage of our opportunities."
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought the Ayr in advantage, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, unlocked by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot did not score a goal.
Climo increased the distance of the Ayr with a rigor first, just in the middle of time, to score and then convert a goal alone to bring the Ayr to 17-5 to the interval.
But Melrose started the second time well and Patrick Anderson's goal, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was therefore a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was put on hold, and at the restart, the Ayr was kicked again in advantage thanks to a Stafford McDowall goal converted by Climo.
Ayr's deputy captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose made the man pay extra with an unconverted goal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
The home team is back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a contrast with Climo without the ball, from the touch of rigor, MacPherson scored a touch down behind the Ayr's advancing mix.
Climo converted, as he had already done almost since the restart, after Rowe had collected football from David Armstrong's area and sent flanker Gregor Henry to search for the home team's fifth goal.
Still Game Star is looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran decided to move to the hotel industry after discovering he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, which writes and plays alongside longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth series will also be the final one in the show and it seems Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to make statements, although a Scottish Sun source made it clear that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous catering trade."
''The sea is ours'': Bolivia hopes that a court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patroll a naval headquarters covered in sartieme in La Paz.
The public buildings exhibit a blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is our right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the lost coast and now in Chile after a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive, as well as the desire to suffocate the Pacific once again.
These hopes may have reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course is waiting for the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court welcomes Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of intermittent dialogue – Chile is obliged to negotiate, ensuring that Bolivia will compete for an offshore strike.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year - has a lot to do with Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chilean territory and said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final rounds indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years could have delayed it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morale’s belligerent rhetoric has failed any remaining good intentions of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain the discussions after what happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, the representative of Bolivia to The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was particularly rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “extraordinary opportunities in its relations with Chile” and will have the opportunity to “end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he said.
Calzadilla has also denied he Morales - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - is using the maritime issue as a political scam.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen without trust in the US
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons unless it can first trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be intending to restart diplomatic talks in stalemate after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri explains that it is an "illusion" that the continuation of sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration of end of the Korean War could never put North Korea on its knees.
Washington refused to release the statement without Pyongyang taking major disarmament actions.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s intention to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its own security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion parades feature the latest trend in huge hats that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to expand your collection of covers or completely block the rays of the sun, look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers have unveiled a series of crazy oversized covers for their spring-summer 2019 collection that impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats got angry on Instagram this summer and these designers sent their captivating creations to the gateway.
The main piece of Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a large feather-like edge that submerged the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included anguries, a witch hat and even an ananas - but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks have sewn lips and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than high seams.
One creation looked like a complete dive with mask and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cone.
And if you continue with the huge statements of style, you are lucky.
Style observers predict that huge drinks could reach you in the high-fashioned streets.
The outsize hats come on the track of "The Bomb", the straw hat with a stretch of more than a meter wide that has been seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that invaded social media sent another huge creation in the gateway: a large straw beach bag almost as big as the costume model that wears it.
The burnt orange rafting bag, finished with rafting fringes and with a white leather sleeve was the strong piece of Jacquemus' La Riviera's spring-summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect these large hats and beach bags to arrive in luxury stores next summer, as the stylist got such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills are Essential for Global Citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this was continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for subsequent higher education, their chosen career and their place in the world as global citizens.
As a field of education capable of developing and adopting a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and demanding subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message will come to his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will come to the heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English only if we want to build trust relationships with people from other countries.
From the results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of graduates, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest scores.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72% of students scored the highest with praise in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish scored the highest.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as fundamental skills for children and young people, which will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages, as a choice of subject, are considered at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons employees indicated for the difficulty in covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason, language skills are becoming more and more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a level sufficient to maintain a conversation, and French was the only two-digit language spoken, 15%.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is so important for today’s children.
Knowledge of multiple languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a valid job.
In Scotland, every school will differ in the taught languages.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK looking at 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with the teaching staff specializing in that field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary for success, whatever their future.
It is not possible at this time, in a global trading system, to deny that languages continue to be fundamental for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday’s pre-championship opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still has to be set for how many minutes he will play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of the week, James was asked what his plans for the six-match pre-championship program were for the Lakers.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need friendly games to prepare myself,” he said.
The time of the meeting a West Virginia Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump from the start tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia at a rally.
It is the first of the five meeting planned for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the pending confirmation vote for his choice to cover the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump will try to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress in the November election.
What time will Trump’s committee be and how can you follow him online?
Trump's committee in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to be held at 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump’s commission in West Virginia online through live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about this week's hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who have become tense over sexual violence charges with a early confirmation vote of the Senate suspended for a week as the FBI conducts the investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans who have to face the November elections get a little push.
Trump's campaign said the five meetings over the course of next week were aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so decisive for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move into the most busy season of the campaign,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, asking for anonymity.
Scheduled for Wheeling’s Wesbank Arena, the committee could call back supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state in which he had won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in the lead in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to push him in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates courage to fight to keep hope alive until Sunday’s individual
After three unidirectional sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum bike is a fully invented sporting concept in which players firmly believe and never as in races like these.
Where would the motorcycle be now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they're four, so I'd say we're keeping a little bit of a bike," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, four points ahead with another twelve at stake.
The Americans feel they have a bit of wind in favor, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to be hopeful, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Spieth was rude from the tea to the green and is giving the example.
The festive gut screams became stronger as the match went on, sinking a crucial putt to match counts to match four, when he and Thomas were below two points after two.
His putt that made them win the 15-hole game was greeted with a similar scream, which tells you that he believes the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You really have to put it all on worrying about your game," Spieth said.
This is all that each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed version of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple from Europe is four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to shoot a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow from and to the crowd, reinforces the certainty that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
However, European speeches of glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon reached Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he was in pairs with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes drown the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they were not able to climb even far back.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the tips they give and don’t give and the way the strategy can change at a time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained a significant advantage in the final day but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, which some, particularly the United States, have doubted.
Europe with an advantage of 10-6 in the Ryder Cup final day
Europe will have a solid advantage in the Ryder Cup final day after finishing Saturday's fourball and foursome games with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired couple composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories on a difficult Tiger Woods to bring the score so far to Le Golf National with four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to keep the trophy lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning fourballs, winning 3-1.
The U.S. has resisted more in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to recover the draw.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points out of Sunday’s 12 matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they worked superbly to beat a downed Woods and American former Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer 5&4.
Woods, who pulled for two games on Saturday, showed occasional bumps of genius but lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, is back with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three of the world rankings.
Europe, however, has not achieved all the expected results in a pleasant and ventilated day southwest of Paris.
The three-time big winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points Saturday.
They scored a sweeping 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has returned from a four-point draw to the individual, although as a holder, the Furyk team only needs a match to defend the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, however, a Sunday counterattack seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that maintaining the sanctions was exacerbating the country’s distrust of the United States, which in such circumstances would absolutely refuse to renounce its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said at the World Organization's General Assembly that North Korea has taken "important goodwill measures" over the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test site and the commitment to the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we don’t see any consistent response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States there will be no security in our national security and in such circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm unilaterally first.”
Although Ri has re-used the complaining notes about Washington's resistance to a "stage denuclearization" with which North Korea would be rewarded on the basis of gradual actions, his statement has been important because he has not completely rejected unilateral denuclearization as already done in the past by Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a US president in office and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to work towards the "denuclearization of the North Korean peninsula," Trump said.
North Korea sought a formal ending agreement to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed appeals to alleviate the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The United States insists on the need to ‘have a denuclearization first’ and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose coercively and even oppose the ‘declaration of end of war’,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is an illusion of those who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are increasing our distrust.”
Ri did not refer to programs for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader had announced to the UN earlier this week.
The minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the counterpart to this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be dead at this point.”
But even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different from last year’s in the UN General Assembly, when he said it was inevitable to target the U.S. territory with North Korea’s missiles after Trump’s “president of evil” called Kim a “missile man on a mission.”
Before the United Nations last year, Trump, who had threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to embark on the path of disarmament, but said that there is still a lot to be done and that sanctions will remain in effect until North Korea’s denuclearization.
Trump said Wednesday he had no deadline, stating that “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “respect for the Security Council’s sanctions must continue with force and without exception until complete, final and verified denuclearization is achieved.”
The Security Council unanimously endorsed sanctions control North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to suppress the funding of nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later stated that he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip has not gone well.
He was told by Pyongyang in July that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea had accused him of filing “gangster requests.”
North Korea had pledged during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the U.S. had taken “compliant measures.”
He said Kim had explained to him that the "compliant measures" he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had committed to in Singapore and actions towards a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take A Course On How To Rest Enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has pushed all its students to sleep more in an attempt to counteract the growing male culture of studying for whole nights powered by caffeine.
A university scholar found that number one university students in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He had the idea to start the course after a conference that had given on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“Finally, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why is this just being said to me now, when I’m in the last year?’
She said no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me a lot,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, given for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive activities.
In one section there is the image of a bedroom, where students can select cups of coffee, curtains, gym shoes and books to be able to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance are influenced by lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how long-term lack of sleep can increase their risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, therefore encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride linked to the “white night to study” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead the lack of sleep to be an ever-growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with good quality sleep should be the student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, obesity, anxiety, explained, and should even serve to avoid gaining weight as lack of sleep leads the brain into inedia mode, making people constantly tired.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the Faculty of Chemical and Physics, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after taking one of his lessons last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, hopefully, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar curriculum before enrolling in this competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock for when they have to go to bed, as well as for when they have to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal kills Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another out-of-home depression attack with Dolly Menga's goal relegating Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team was looking for the first out-of-home victory from the February 4–1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach leaving his eight-point team from the running leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the interval and a short-inspiring Rangers training never seemed to be able to match.
As the Ranger now drops to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, and only behind the Hibernian by goal difference.
And there could be further problems arriving for the Rangers after the Calum Spence watch line was treated for a head injury due to an apparently thrown object from the outside of the house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly surpassed Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual training that broke a point at the Hearts last week and would be satisfied with the way his well-prepared team suffocated his opponents every round.
The Rangers may have dominated for possession of the ball, but the Livingston has better exploited the balls at his disposal.
They could have scored just after two minutes when Menga's filtering passage in the first time sent Scott Pittman forward to Allan McGregor's door but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
A deep penalty kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot side by side on the second pole.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than conviction in their game in the area of rigor.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had to see himself assign a rigor at the end of the fifteenth after a match with Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian demands.
The Rangers managed to shoot only twice in the first time but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not left to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and a soft shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston’s opening goal in the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it even just for his commitment.
Again, the Rangers failed to manage a football placed deep in Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher filtered the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the shift had an almost immediate impact as the wing inflected a ball at Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw himself from the door line to block it.
But the Livingston continued to drag visitors exactly into the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one ball long after the other.
Holt's team may have increased detachment in the final stages, but McGregor opposed to stop Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers deputy Glenn Middleton filed a last demand for rigor after a crossing with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanacco: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and the CONTEGIO continues... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as the Geiger counter.
A stalemate of science ever since, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," played by those unreliable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these earbuds you can really feel the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "She's exploding a little bit right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells and Kill them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Malignant Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to many types of cancers and are then reintroduced.
An experimental test of this vaccine is delivering promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and then these cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein "promotes the growth of different types of cancers", including breast, ovaries, lungs and colon, Berzofsky explained.
A similar procedure of extracting immune cells from patients to “teach” them how to hit cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West throws himself into a pro-Trump diatribe wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) beret after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was whispered into the studio during a Saturday Night Live play after a knockout performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After playing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA beret, he began a riot against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people many times and they say to me, ‘How much you like Trump, he’s a racist!’”
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh mocked the testimony before the Senate Justice Commission against the sexual violence charges filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's recording of the Filipina was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had had a bad time in the backstage because of his cover-up.
“I was bullied in the backstage.
They told me, ‘Don’t go out with that beret on it.’
They bullied me!
And then they told me I was a marginalized," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the submerged place?" and said, "I'd wear Superman's coat because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try the love."
His comments generated hiccups from the public at least twice and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety said, with a person who told the newspaper: "A deadly silence has fallen on the study."
West had been invited as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West has confused many with a performance of Perrier's bottle-wrapped song I Love It.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA Conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: Thank you for holding the Mass Test."
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "what it is and this is simply wonderful."
“But I chose not to reward someone (by acquiring his music or his clothes or by supporting his ‘art’) who I think is embracing a vomiting ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
And so we are," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and is following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The friend rapper, Snoop Dogg, named himself Snoop Lion and of course the disappearing musical legend Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and thus in the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was slashed in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The accident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant will have to appear at the Belfast Prefecture on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Star of the Throne of Sword Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow fighter in the violent medieval fantasy series Throne of Swords.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that such screen soles often make the boys believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought "something went wrong" and reflected on how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old co-star of Throne of Swords, has admitted to worrying a lot about this problem.
"Personally, I'm very concerned at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?" he said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we're seeing now?'
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes kids think they have to be in this particular way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time – how can we change things?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for the young people.'
During the interview, he also admitted that he would not play any prequels or sequels of Throne of Sword once the series ended next summer, claiming to have "completed with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play the lead role in the revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor has recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose the best thing that happened with the Throne of Swords.
“I met my wife during this series, so it gave me my future family, and my life from now on,” he explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Jon Snow, the character of Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS.
More than 820.000 people are affected by these diseases, according to health authorities.
Approximately 40,000 new cases have already been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, according to Chinese health authorities during a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 units.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country’s traditional values, some studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protection during sexual intercourse within such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has hacked GOP senators' data, and talks about "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory".
The U.S. deputy on Saturday denounced allegations against a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the legislators’ Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic deputy in Los Angeles said the statements were encouraged by far-right opinionists and websites.
"Lies, lies, and yet disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released would include home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday, released by an anonymous Capitol in the course of an expert hearing on sexual violence allegations against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The news leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and released information relating to a Waters staff member.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security has been put at risk as a result of these false and trendy accusations, was in no way responsible for the leak of such information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ assertion quickly generated online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he doesn't have the character to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
It must not be provocative.
He must not question the prosecutor's motives.
It must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by detractors of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to remove Waters in the midterm elections, has expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's huge," he tweeted.
In its statement, Waters said its office had alerted "the competent authorities and law enforcement forces to these trendy statements.
“We will make sure that those responsible are uncovered and that they must be accountable for all their dangerous and harmful actions for all members of my staff.”
Review of Johnny English hits still - the parody of the spy with a subsized Rowan Atkinson
It has now become customary to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British touch and this seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English’s action comedy, started in 2003 and revived in 2011 with Johnny English – The Rebirth.
The sailboat self-iron on the issue of how badly we do will be the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English from his rubber face and eyes out of orbit got his license to pick things up for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that it is a comic creation developed for non-Anglophone filmmakers countries.
Obviously, he’s the silly secret agent who despite his strange claims of glamour has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a bit of that kind that contributed with a single note to the Gloria moments theme of the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It’s a character originally based on a mysterious international traveler and man who once played Atkinson in Barclaycard’s now forgotten television ads, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this last release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the helicopters swing briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems quite undersized and strangely superfluous, especially now that brands of “serious” films like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy misadventures are not as original and targeted as the gags of Atkinson’s silent films when he plays Mr. Bean.
The premise of immutable currentness now is the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated the supersecret web of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, with the agent's dismissal, a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the drop that makes the jar for a presumptuous and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering a stroke of political impopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this character-like-Theresa May but there’s not much to work on in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every single active spy has been compromised and that she will have to call back someone who has already retired.
And this means that the badass Johnny English, who now works as a school executive at a chic establishment, but also gives informal lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gags, when English offers a School of Rock-like espionage course.
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with his former suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a high-company girl role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of the Disasters for His Majesty's Secret Services are back in action, to meet the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling into the network of the charismatic billionaire of technology who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: leftist Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, set fire to a French restaurant; unleash hell by clandestinely entering the luxury yacht of Volta, and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a virtual reality mask to take home with him.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but no matter how clumsy and exuberant, there’s a lot of children’s TV throughout history.
Everything is fairly modest.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help thinking: could the British film industry not assign Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies being working on a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, even if they were paid for five.
The party would like the major companies to transfer the savings obtained by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an extra rest day.
In this way, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, keeping the same pay.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic agenda and with plans to incline the country in favor of workers.
The transition to a four-day day was endorsed by the trade union congress as a way for workers to benefit from the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “By the end of the year it is expected to announce a revision of the political line.”
"It won't happen from day to day, but a four-day working week is an aspiration in line with the party's approach to the rebalancing of the economy in favour of the workers, as well as with its industrial strategy as a whole."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week as part of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, such an aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not part of the party’s political line and is not currently under discussion.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to detail his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from “faceless leaders” and “speculators” in public service businesses.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also imply that current shareholders of water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock package, as the Labour government could implement “deductions” based on behaviors considered illegal.
He also confirmed plans to include employees in the boards of directors of companies and create funds for inclusive participation, so as to transfer 10 percent of the net assets of private sector companies to employees, who end up putting in their pockets annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises doubts whether the government agency's findings can influence or not any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to bring to light something that could make them change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said it while I was going to the hearing, I said, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, that came out of that charge, I said, 'Did you do it?'
It was resolved, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems to be carved in the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could resist a bomb-proof charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett vigorously denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“Anyone you name hasn’t been able to prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that sees the exhibition of a remarkable star basketball and has an equally remarkable mission: ending poverty in the world.
Arriving at the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people roaming the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also an awareness about the real purpose of the event, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a number of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other significant way that could help to clear their mind about it.
But, exactly, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival now that 12 years are left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a genuine way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another example of the so-called “clicktivism” people who feel they’re really making the difference simply by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters, operating for a lot of different purposes.
It says these actions have helped urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies of more than <0x24>37 billion, aimed at impacting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements from their shares, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been disbursed or used as funds.
The group estimates that so far protected capital funds have had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and executives, committed to “helping children grow to the fullest of their potential,” with the promise to provide Rwanda with <0x24>35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition become a footnote in history," the 2018 ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the crowd at a live conference.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions have been implemented calling for the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, he asked: “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and hard journey – sometimes we will frame and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of those who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy to implement "a blockade" and hinder Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington can, “if necessary,” use its navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate for energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern hub of Europe," he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that the nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, to implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as “a little versatile,” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to boost exports of its natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, an option that for European consumers is absolutely the cheapest.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of North Stream 2, a "inappropriate" pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the <0x24>11 billion gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, designed to double its pre-existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economical project.
The Kremlin objects that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said, following a meeting with the United States in September.
The U.S. position has triggered Germany’s negative reaction, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay out of the EU’s energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see as a big problem the fact that a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Take "Serious Consideration" to Candidate for President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take "serious consideration" to run for president following the midterm elections.
During a city assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he contemplated the possibility of applying.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and put our unruly government in place, and that implies having a woman at the top,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.”
During the city assembly Warren said his own about President Donald Trump, declaring that he was “bringing this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, by whom he was nominated to the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: “It is natural that there is a need for an FBI investigation before the vote.”
A poll published Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren’s own voters don’t think they should run in 2020.
58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not compete, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-three percent voted for such a candidate.
The poll showed greater support for a nomination by former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in support of a potential nomination and 48 percent against.
Other names of high-profile Democrats discussed on a potential 2020 nomination include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What’s going on, my son, what’s going on after I’m back, I can put it in relation to other families experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorders and some of the injuries our soldiers are returning with,” Trump told a meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and any other member of the army, have dedicated themselves to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a relationship for domestic violence and possession of a gun under drugs, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia Support the Challenge for New Asylum Policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia on Friday presented a memory amicus curiae in Washington to support an asylum seeker who contested this policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions appeal that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and her violent children members of the gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
It was put on a standstill in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing widespread gang-related problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals allowing applicants to file an asylum application for immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence.
On Friday, District Attorney General of Columbia, Karl Racine, said the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of particular circumstances and circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates that principle,” the Amicus curiae memoir said.
The prosecutors also objected that the policy banning the entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, stating the clear probability that they become entrepreneurs and “provide necessary labour.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer guarantee asylum for victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is accessible to those who leave their country of origin due to persecution or fears due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or for a political opinion," Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum has never been designed to mitigate every problem -- even every serious problem -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate attempts to recover in Palu as the death toll doubles in search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly desperate.
"There's a lot of tension," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, while comforting her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"At any moment there is an ambulance that carries the bodies.
"Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, robbing among their frail personal effects, in an attempt to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were scrapped.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, a victim of a shoulder and back fracture, rested outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continued strong siege shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he told the feeling of the violent earthquake that shook the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
“There was no time to save us.
"I was crushed in the rubble of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Making Prerogatives” With “Advertising”
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper, advertising the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to advertise.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the announcement paid by the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the highest-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge that China re-accuses.
Trump’s prosecution about Beijing’s attempt to interfere in U.S. elections noted what U.S. officials have reported to Reuters to be a new phase of Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an escalating trade war that has seen them adapt their duties to their imports.
China’s repatriation tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were intended to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, as Chinese and US experts have stated.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime Iowa governor, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, peasants and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “now increases those prepotences by publishing advertising on our free newspapers.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Conversely, in the street ecclesiastical here in Beijing you will find little dissident voices and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese people might have on China’s economic trajectory, as the media are under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has eluded the offer to publish" his article, although he has not stated which newspaper it is.
Republicans are alienating women's electorate before mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
Since many leading Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court and are on his side in dealing with various charges of sexual harassment, analysts have reported that there will be a negative reaction, especially by women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The agitation in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to proceed with a vote.
"These things cannot be withdrawn," said Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last-minute insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) on an FBI investigation would be enough to flatter angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it neither tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokeswoman for MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate, when Republicans controlling the Judicial Commission chose to continue with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats is going to the stars," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say they were already tall; it’s true.
But they could be higher, especially among the indecisive electricians in the peripheries and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote despite dislike the president.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which provided details of his allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts had hypothesized that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
“For the GOP it has become a confusing set,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the vote for the committee, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it’s also about the way Republicans handled the situation and the way they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, told the news channel.
In any case, Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to believe in as a result of the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a lower percentage in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one of the other prosecutors, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her as a Jew at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his genitals during a party during his studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that draws its origins from Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will be able to access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden intent behind Inrupt was to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data store" or POD.
It can include contact lists, things to do, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data warehouse is that it is entirely at the user's choice who can have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal enhancing through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to bring the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, some developers in the staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers around the world will be able to bring their decentralized apps to life using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not tell Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely detached from day to day.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann commemorates the ecclesiastical of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only Church of England ecclesiastical to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was commemorated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a knife and never knew he had achieved the highest level of British military honor.
On Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren inaugurated a memorial plaque.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning prodigy.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very fictitious fog, under the heavy fire of the camp and the war machines."
Then he hurried towards the fire line and with the "largest gallantry" made the line advance before running with a single-handed cannon and landing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never be high and something that makes him more humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "really honored to have a role in the parade" and added "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to him by a lot of people."
MMA fans have been standing all night watching Bellator 206, and instead they’ve kicked Peppa Pig.
Imagine, you’ve been awake all night watching the famous Bellator 206 only to then see the view of the main event denied.
The San Jose program included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was supposed to be broadcast in the UK overnight, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, TV viewers in the UK were stunned when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some remained grounded after being awake until the early hours of the morning especially for combat.
On Twitter, a fan described the transition to children’s cartoon as “a kind of bad taste joke.”
“Government regulation provides that at six in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so we had to switch to child programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," "yes."
"Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they will work on the programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think when I think of replay, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
“But there are six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for them.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it changed schedule a lot of messages came and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to limit it to five fights instead of six -- as we usually do -- and we've tried to get so much for the fans, and we've just discussed it.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Lower' Due to Sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his sexuality – but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he did not realize, until he got to high school, that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking in the first installment of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she had made her voice heard about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also stated that being a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the old-fashioned program, Kirsty Young, took a series of months off for illness.
Presenting himself as a marginalized in Laverne's first program, Daley stated that he felt "less than" anyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable that he liked both boys and girls."
“Today, the feeling of feeling less, and of feeling different, were the things that really gave me the strength and energy to succeed.”
He wanted to try to be “something,” he said, so that no one would be disappointed if they accidentally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medal at the Olympics became a high-profile LGBT activist and used his face at this year’s Australian Commonwealth Games to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man - the American director Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "has surprised me."
Daley married Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When it happens so much at a young age" - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The two became parents in June of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about the fact that ‘I had to win a gold medal’,” he said.
“You know, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be on this side so you can be in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I had not yet realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had a special meaning for him in the preparation for the Olympics and still makes him look like oak.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out-form put on the bench in Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to get back in shape to prevent it from becoming an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the two-year event for a record twelfth time, was put on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between cheerleading and working on his own game in the range, hoping to correct what torments him.
Having never been the strongest driver even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the unbroken track regularly punishes the wrong shots.
And if the path itself wasn’t discouraging enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces the precise champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who has collaborated with the novelist Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of their 12 single matches, start with a boring start, Mickelson’s match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, which he could not say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a kick on his shoulder, put an arm around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It’s a Hall of Famer and he added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn’t think he would play two games.
I had imagined more, but this is how it went and this is how we thought it would go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never even far from reflected the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven matches, although Furyk said his presence brought intangible assets to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, argumentative, he likes to play with people, and he’s a fantastic guy to have in the meeting room,” he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, something that was fun to watch.
He did much more than play.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can disappear soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows by experience that a considerable advantage in individual Ryder Cup final day matches can easily turn into an uncomfortable run.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 match at Valderrama where the team, captained by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point detachment from the Americans, reached the goal line with a minimum advantage, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"I keep repeating that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little," Bjorn said after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday for 5-3 and yesterday for 10-6, at Le Golf National.
"That's why the story will prove to me and my team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we have to make the most of it.
You have to go out there and do everything the right way.
It is not finished until the points are marked in the board.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world."
Happy with the way his teams competed in that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never have surpassed myself.
Tomorrow's is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performances, which is another thing.
It’s nice to be there with a teammate when things go well, but when you’re alone your golf skills are put to the test.
This is the message you need to convey to the players: tomorrow, you have to get the best out of yourself.
Then you forget about your partner because he too has to go there and get the best out of him.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek the best individual performance in his players more than a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself found himself on both sides in those big last-day matches, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing against the European "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every single word," he commented in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players to his head on the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start right now, just like we did in Brookline and Medinah.
When the game starts to take a certain bending, the pressure increases in the intermediate games.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the boys in the way we think it is appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counteroffensive and facing Rory McIlroy in the top game with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the road to the end," Bjorn said of his selection for individual matches.
Germany's new military ship has been postponed again
According to local media, the last German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the Cold War, but it will not be there until at least next year due to faulty systems and a cost imbalance.
The Rhineland-Palatinate commission, the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cited a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but worrying issues following the delivery have tormented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class ships.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic markings.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, as it should be possible to use the new freight ships up to two years away from the national ports.
However, the continuing delays imply that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its overseas power, will become obsolete when they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unlucky Type F-125 frigate reported last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media noted a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that made the ship useless if used in a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the staff of the oldest Bremen class ships.
In addition, it has emerged that the ship weighs significantly too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future updates.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to be twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is also becoming an important issue.
It appears to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems involving the new frigates become of particular importance in light of recent alarms regarding the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the parliamentary commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the navy "actually scarce ships capable of being employed".
The official said the issue has deteriorated considerably over time, as old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies the secret life of squirrels
New research carried out in a Scottish Highland estate aims to reveal the way in which cockroaches use sight to get food.
It is confident that the findings can shed light on the behavior of the only existing flying mammals and lead future protective activities.
The study of scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano whistleblowers, as well as the brown ears and whistleblowers from Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special registrars will be positioned in key locations around the property to track the activities of squirrels during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
The analysis of the sounds recorded by an expert will determine the frequency of whistleblower calls and how each species behaves.
They will then produce a habitat map and a report to create a detailed picture on a scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the findings will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to mammals and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of lawns, and how to best maintain forests for mammals and other related species.
The population of squirrels in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Pipstrells are at risk because of construction and development work that affects trenches and ruins the habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as well as moss paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to domestic cat attacks.
The squirrels are not really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than the eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-localization technique to detect insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the mermaids very seriously.
Ten qualified experts conduct investigations regularly, inspect the trenches, and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization has even established the first Scottish reserve for sharks only at Threave, in the Dumfries and Galloway region, which hosts eight of the ten species of sharks in Scotland.
The head of the estate, David Thompson, says that the property is the ideal territory.
"Here in Threave, we have a wide area for squirrels," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many centuries-old trees and a good habitat.
But there’s a lot about pets that we don’t know yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about their growth needs.”
It underlines the importance of checking the squirrels before conducting maintenance inside the property as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternal triangle can kill up to 400 females and small ones, perhaps sweeping away an entire local population.
Squirrels are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them, or destroy their trunks.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to contribute to helping.
“We still have a lot to learn about our mammals and for many of our species we don’t know how their populations pass by.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the charges of rape against him as “fake news,” saying people “would like to be advertised” with his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel that published the charges.
Portuguese Juventus striker Kathryn Mayorga was accused of raping an American woman in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel also announced on Friday the charge of paying <0x24>375,000 to keep silent about the incident.
In a video on Instagram directed to his 142 million followers, in the hours following the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo snapped the statements as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false,” says the five-time Golden Ball facing the camera.
“They want to be advertised through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by making my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and everything's fine," he added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on the charges, which he called “an unacceptable report of suspicions about the private sphere.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “moral damages to the extent corresponding to the severity of the breach of privacy, which is likely to be one of the most serious personal rights of recent years.”
The event would have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga would return to the footballer's room, where he subjected her to anal violence, according to statements filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga argues that Ronaldo would have stood on his knees after the incident, saying he was "99 percent" a "good guy" disappointed by "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sexual intercourse, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga also said she had gone to the police and hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a reconciliation agreement as she felt “terrorized by retaliation” and worried about the prospect of “being publicly humiliated”.
The 34-year-old is now trying to overturn the deal, claiming to still be traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and this summer he will join Italian Juventus with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: the UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK "may regret forever" the loss of its world-leading automotive status following Brexit, Industry Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "concerned" about Toyota UK's statements to the BBC about Britain's eventual exit from the EU without an agreement and the resulting temporary blockade of production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Minister Clark said.
The Japanese automaker claims that border delays, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, could affect workplaces.
The Burnaston factory, which houses the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO in Burnaston.
It raises concerns among other British automakers about exiting the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit, it will close its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain encountered by manufacturers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of the “just in time” concept, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and European suppliers for custom cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there could be border unrest that would lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of inventory value at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid these unrest at the borders".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the current success but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“The test, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a hugely successful distribution chain.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop, but in the long run, it warns that additional costs could reduce the competitiveness of plants and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the plant’s trade union delegates, says that workers are deeply concerned: “According to my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are no longer reintegrated.”
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House said.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "returned by a week" as the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction to justice.
The possibility that Trump could fire the deputy justice minister, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
Over the course of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a tie to record conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But he went to the White House last Monday and was rumoured to be leaving.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced for Wednesday, which was at the United Nations at the time in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid an overlap with the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of FBI interrogation on Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate’s final vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date has not been set, it could be this week, I guess it will be delayed by another week considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and continue to update the press.”
Some journalists may contest this statement: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Conductor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of briefings was not due to an aversion to television journalists “who show up,” although he said, “I don’t disagree with the fact that they show up.”
He then thought that direct contact between Trump and the press might be more frequent.
"The president holds more sessions of questions and answers than any president before him," he said, adding, without citing the evidence: "We have checked the figures."
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We try to do this, as in the last few weeks, and this will replace the briefings with the press and you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated the reason, by giving a free-wheel speech, and at the same time a strange one, in front of a group of journalists.
Minister of Health writes to European NHS workers in Scotland to express his concerns about Brexit
The health minister wrote to EU staff working at Scotland’s NHS to express Scotland’s gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months in advance of the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to addressing the costs of settlement status requests for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "Throughout the summer, there have been ongoing negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to decisions in the autumn.
But the British government has also prepared itself for the possibility of a scenario without an agreement.
I know this is a period of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and not only, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and communities to which we offer services.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly wish you stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie was operated on as a result of a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after reporting a head injury in Saturday's game against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost by 31 to 27, according to Mike Organ of the Tennessee newspaper.
Technical Manager Rod Reed told reporters that the accident that caused the injury occurred shortly before the interval.
"He approached the field and he disappeared," Reed said.
First-aid personnel and medical personnel delivered oxygen to Abercrombie on board, before putting it in the barrel and taking it away for further checks.
A Tennessee State executive told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "no news is yet about the type and extent of the damage" and that Tennessee State are trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five scorings before leaving the game, which brought his season total to 18 scorings.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, according to new Labour plans
The maneuver will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s initiative to attract young voters
Increased tax will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury Ministry plans to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for the purchase of property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
The maneuver will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s initiative to attract young voters with the promise to provide more affordable housing and higher incomes.
The increase in the stamp tax will be applied to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional resources will be in support of the Government’s initiative to combat the homeless phenomenon.
The surplus, which adds to the current stamp tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second houses and on real estate buy to beds (buy to be rented), could amount to more than 3%.
The Ministry of the Treasury expects the maneuver to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, raising prices and making it difficult for buyers of a first home to enter the real estate market.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas, especially in the capital, have become "fantasy cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the state.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson had demanded a cut on the stamp tax to help younger people with the purchase of the first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by acquiring land without using them and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up quotas on affordable housing to settle the UK’s “real estate misfortune.”
Mr Corbyn has announced a sparking series of proposals for housing market reform, including rent controls and the elimination of innocent waste.
He also wants to give the council more powers on the construction of new properties.
Prime Minister May said: “Last year I said I would be committed to restoring the British dream, namely that life should be better for new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if the purchase of a home was just as easy for people who are not residing in the UK and for foreign companies as it is for UK workers residing in the UK.
For so many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality.”
Jack Ross: "My greatest aspiration is to drive Scotland"
Sunderland's technical director, Jack Ross, says his "highest aspiration" is to sooner or later become Scotland's manager.
The 42-year-old Scottish is attracted to the challenge of bringing back the Northeast team that is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He landed at the Stadium of Light this summer after being the driver of the St. Mirren during last season’s Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I've been in Serie B and that's all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsound program.
I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it is something I will always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager.”
Ross' predecessors to Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic technician claims to have no anxiety about following such important names in an equally important team, having previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"Success for me right now is measured by the ability to bring the team back into the Premier League."
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I can get the team back on track."
Ross’s career as manager began three years ago, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as a deputy coach for the Hearts.
He then helped the Alloa save himself from the recession to the third level and brought St. Mirren from the edge of the recession to the Championship championship title the following season.
Ross claims to feel much more comfortable now than during his football career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls about the Alloa direction.
“I really believed that the role of manager was made for me, rather than the role of a player.
It sounds strange because I worked well, gained from living and had some good results.
But playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with weekly.
I still deal with them in terms of stress and pressure at work but the management looks good.
I’ve always wanted to lead, and now I do, I feel much calmer than I’ve never been in my life.”

According to one study, the right time for a painting is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heatwave has led to increased revenues for British pubs in difficulty and more concern for restaurant services.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s commercial advisory firm, put together the data and commented: “The persistence of the sun and the long stay of England at the World Cups has led the month of July to follow a path similar to that of June, when the pubs were above 2.8 percent, while the restaurants were harder.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurants in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which you mostly drink are the most solid, with a homogeneous increase above the decline of restaurants.
Even the pubs where you eat have suffered the heat, though not excessively like the restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out and drink something.
In pubs and bars, sales of beverages rose by 6.6 per cent per month, while food consumption fell by three per cent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s recreational and recreational analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remains the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent annual sales drop will be particularly heavy in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurateurs and only the weather can tell if the more moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary truce.”
Global sales growth between pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the drop in brand roll-outs.

One in five children owns secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
A survey reveals that one in five children, some only 11 years old, own secret social network accounts that hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake on Instagram” pages
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted in the background.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “principal” account to show their parents.
One in five children, some only 11 years old, create social network accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted in the background.
Twenty percent of students said they managed a "principal" account cleaned up to show their parents, while keeping a private one.
A mother who accidentally discovered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage girl urging others to "rape me".
The research, from the UK’s Digital Awareness and Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of private schools, showed that 40 percent of boys aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted to holding private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to Be 'Voice for Athletes' at Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive member of the Board of Scottish Athletics during the National General Assembly of the Administrative Body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete of lightweight athletics and President Ian Beattie described the nomination as a great opportunity for those managing the sport to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a deep respect for the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that in Scotland athletics could take a huge advantage by bringing it to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I can't wait to act as a voice of athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help drive the sport in Scotland."
The American, winner of the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and four Olympic Gold Medals, as well as currently a BBC opinionist, found herself unable to walk following a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time could tell if I was recovering and to what extent.
It was a exhausting job but I have recovered completely, he has learned to walk again and today I move with agility!
Thank you for your message of encouragement!”
Advertising of a stripper compares mothers and cows and shares opinion online
A company that produces a tick splits opinion online with an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers and cows that come up in the mountains.
To mark the launch of what is defined as the “world’s first silent and wearable pulley,” consumer technology company Elvie has launched an advertisement in the form of a joke music video to showcase freedom of expression as mothers given from the new pulley.
Four real mothers dance in a cow’s tent on a track that includes songs like, “Yes, I’m pulling my milk but I don’t have one” and “If I didn’t notice, these are not breasts but my tits.”
The choir continues, "Put him out, throw him out, feed the children, throw him out, throw him out, throw the milk to my ladies."
However, the advertising, posted on the company’s Facebook pages, has caused controversy on the network.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked different reactions among viewers, many of whom claimed it highlighted the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“It’s an unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their little ones are stolen from them a few days after their birth,” someone wrote.
The Elvie stripper wears discretely under a bra for moms
Another commented: “Comprehensibly traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a strip for mothers who will continue to hold their children?”
Someone else added, “It’s really a pointless advertisement.”
Others have defended her and a woman has even admitted to finding the song "fun".
"I think it's a great idea.
If you're still breastfeeding, I'd like one.
When I was wearing the pulley, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit irreverent, but it doesn’t get far from reality.
This is a great product,” someone wrote.
Another person commented: "It's a fun advertisement dedicated to moms who use scissors (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like "pumps."
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the domestic industry.”
In the end, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet pulley inserted into the bra.
The concept to which the countryside is inspired is based on the idea that many women who use the pulley feel like cows.
The Elvie pulley, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be threaded into a breastfeeding bra giving women the freedom to move, hold their children in their arms and even go out while they pull the milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and ECD commented: “Elvie is such a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative launch.
“By comparing women who use tyres to cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new tyres can provide.”
This is not the first time Elvie has made news.
During London fashion week, the mother of two children showed up on the walkway of designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved Silently in a Tent on Texas Border
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the tough rhetoric and political line of the Trump administration has made it harder to trust these children.
Most of those who took them into custody were generally clandestine immigrants who now fear to put at risk the possibility of staying in the country by offering to carry out such a gesture.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential trustees and other adult members of their families would be fingerprinted and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in front of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had offered to take care of children alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
“Almost 80% of people who offer to take care of children or belong to the families of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are foreign criminals.
We are therefore continuing to hunt these people,” Albence said.
In order to try to prosecute children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that some of them will have to appear in court within a month of the arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to who works at the reception points.
Many will appear in videoconferencing instead of in person, to file their legal case with an immigration judge.
Those who will be deemed unfit to receive help will be expelled quickly.
The longer children remain in trust, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or attempts to escape, according to those who work at reception points and the reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who hold this position claim that the likelihood that this will happen is even higher in a large structure like that of Tornillo where, precisely because of its size, it is easier for children’s signs of discomfort to be ignored.
They add that moving children in the tent without giving them time to prepare emotionally or salute friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war has reached its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces illegally occupy Syrian soil on the pretext of combating terrorism and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without putting any conditions," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 deaths and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
Damascus will continue to fight this holy war until it has liberated all Syrian territories from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and supporting the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the field in this country destroyed by war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions are favourable to their return and accused "some Western countries" of "instilling unfounded fears" that push refugees to stay away from their homeland.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
“What should only be a humanitarian problem is politicized.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted in Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a bearing zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "precise deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists, including fighters on the al-Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, which "will be eradicated."
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes he will soon be able to convene a new committee of members of the government and opposition to lay out a draft constitution for post-war Syria and prepare the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump Will Give Himself a Second Mandate
Based on this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers perhaps hope, his presidency should not end prematurely due to an impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidency final ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of flexion of the spectators.
Since 2014, the first night’s percentages have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News had an average of 2.4 million spectators in the first night, significantly increasing compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” program surpassed the network’s percentage by reaching 3.5 million spectators in the evenings with the most important news.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something explainable," said Neal Baer, a showrunner from ABC's "Designated Survivor" television series that tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an expert comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, “Why do you make me laugh?”
Chaos is a source of fun.
Naturally, unlike any other television program, the plot of Washington’s events can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade judgment, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite or not, and the state of health of the global economy.
However, stopping to follow the news is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes well beyond the duty of informed citizens to follow for the sixth hour in a row a group of experts discussing Bob Woodward's in-depth research for his book "Fear", from Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar strut skin jacket (“a dress full of discotishes” and comments from The Washington Post that involves Daniel Stortotanza.

"Part of the reason why it looks like a reality show is that every night there's news," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", about the advent of actors and the daily developments of the show's plot--that is.

This week I went to see Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and although it was a day of sunshine with almost 30 degrees, he was locked in his house watching MSNBC and while recording CNN.
He was unable to disconnect from TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Judicial Committee and faced with the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented, "I remember when we once did all those absurd programs and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

External cash inflow in the race for the tightest half-term elections
It is no surprise that in the 17th district there is an influx of money due to the re-alignment of a congressional district that has made two members in office now running for the same place.
The recent redefinition of Pittsburgh’s suburban district brings to the fore the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania that overtakes the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that in the old districts electoral colleges had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race to the 17th district triggered a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a measurable victory in the March special elections for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump has awarded the district for 20 points.
Political opinionists have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. thought to penalize El Salvador for supporting China, then changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, a rather friendly meeting was held between President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until his partners forced the Trump Organization’s leadership group to leave.
State Department officials have decided to bring back the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following the “recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” said Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert in a statement.
But the decision to impose sanctions was made only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received US<0x24>140 million in drug trafficking, development and economic support aid from the Americans.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on visa granting, would be of concern to the Central American country with a high rate of unemployed and murders.
After a series of internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials clarified that they intended to continue the conference, thus definitively waiving any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence was commissioned to chair the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving further messages of reproach or punishment from Washington.
A Bolton spokesman at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak, anonymously, of internal decisions.
What they said was confirmed by an external analyst near the administration who wanted to keep anonymity anyway.
You're studying history
In the report, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, which appears to be sufficient evidence.
According to what is said, Mueller’s investigation intends to shed light on Trump’s possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress passed to Democrats, Trump should respond to these allegations before voters and perhaps a jury of his peers as he prepares for a new nomination.
The inconsistencies are many and I do not intend to say that Trump’s fall is inevitable, as is not the case with his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight may take.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western powers had stopped him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
On that occasion, we failed to miss the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans at the moment have to deal with it differently.
What would happen if Trump decided to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein’s position has been complicated since this newspaper reported that it secretly suggested last year to subject Trump to interception by questioning his ability to cover up the presidency.
Rosenstein argues that the news outlet in The Times is not true.
“How will we react if the FBI’s new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or will be confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the credible charges of attempted rape and false testimony?
And most importantly, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to respond to his actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think that we will do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles with swastika.
With such a legacy, I can only be optimistic about the future."

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about meeting with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the compelling match against Villarreal in Spain, would give them great opportunities to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Although due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season just on the occasion of a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, he believes that this result could allow the Rangers to do great things.
"For us, it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team," he said.
“We faced the game convinced we were doing well and we brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extremis but, after all, the match is a fair result.
They were better in the first time, while in the second we played better.
As for Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult match because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will not be able to disappoint.
“Last year has certainly been difficult because of my injuries and changes at the club level, but now the sensations are positive.
The team is in shape, the kids have fun and the preparation goes well.
So we can forget the problems of last season and think about the future.”
Women Are Worried About the Cost of Long-Term Care
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of assistance they would like to receive, few have addressed the topic in their family.
About half of Nationwide’s respondents say they have talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% say they have spoken to their children.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of the insurance industry on Nationwide’s life, “people want to be a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t face this conversation.”
That's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family to assist you if you don’t communicate what you want in time.
If you have a consultant, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be decisive for costs.
Involve a financial advisor: he will be able to advise you on how to pay the expenses you will have to face.
Choosing a long-term assistance financing can include a traditional insurance policy or a life-saving hybrid policy to cover these expenses or continue to spend money on insurance as long as you are able to do so.
Prepare all the necessary documents to avoid legal battles at your death.
Appoint a health care prosecutor so that a person you trust can supervise medical care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes in case you were unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of a prosecution for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and make sure your accounts are paid in case you were not able to do so.
Don’t forget the details: imagine that your elderly parent is taken to the hospital urgently.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you are always ready.
"It's not just a matter of finance, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Get ready for any event.”

The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit to the chest, abdomen and one hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "random action".
The victim did not see his aggressor.
He is not in danger and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people have died as a result of a very strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
The communications were interrupted and the rescue workers were unable to get any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu near the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential data about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Central Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island and with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
When it was hit by the earthquake and the tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of support for the economy of the Sulawesi Central province and especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is concentrated mostly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by a tsunami in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami struck the western Donggala area in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the so-called seismic zone of the Pacific belt of fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a very strong earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries killing, along the Indian Ocean coast, 226,000 people, of whom more than half of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit the southern part of the island of Giava, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that exploded on the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 crashed near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
The victims were more than 1,100.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who recalled the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case there was no tsunami but more than 100 people died under the rubbish.
2018: A strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
According to a report issued Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting arrest.
According to the report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she smashed her handphone.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and his bail was set at <0x24>500, according to KTUU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "certainly innocent".
Palin is at risk of being charged with three first-degree crimes, namely detention for up to a year and a fine of <0x24>250,000.
He was also charged with a second-degree crime punishable with a day of detention and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal acts.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged aggression.
The case is currently under consideration by the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of obstructing the reporting of the crime and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in connection with the accident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her with a fist in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 for linking her child’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result of the period she spent in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are not working, and the victim’s budget is set to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck off Sulawesi Central, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, videos show the moment of the impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Extraordinary Capital Penalty for Suspects of Terrorist Attacks in NYC
New York's federal prosecutors demand the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the perpetrator of the terrorist attack that killed eight people: a rare punishment that has never been committed for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rented Home Depot van to plunge on a cycling track along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
Under the conditions for the request for capital punishment in the southern district of New York, to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and also "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries.
According to the court's document, both of these charges can lead to the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury issued 22 indictments to Saipov that included eight counts of crime-associated murder, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of automobiles.
The attack called for “true planning and premeditation,” the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
The preliminary notification states that "Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov has caused damage, insult and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Memiza and Pagnuja Ale".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the Southern District of New York prosecuted the last case of capital punishment.
The man cited in court, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and charged with passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg's husbands both died on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
Police said they were proud of what they had done in front of the investigators.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he had decided to complete the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As for the 22 chiefs of indictment, he declared himself innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt and the death penalty without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s group of lawyers had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of Parliament Tory Says Nigel Farage Must Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage today vowed to "move the People's Army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of Theresa May’s party MPs suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK’s Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK "would already be out of Europe" if Farage were the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenges May must face to try to reconcile her deeply divided party positions have been highlighted by Tory supporters who participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The prime minister is trying to implement the Chequers Plan among the attacks of Brexit supporters, of those who want to stay in Europe and the European Union.
The Allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and the “chaos”.
At the committee of the Leave Means Leave organization held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should be entrusted to Farage.
“At this time, we would be out of Europe,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I am for Brexit but we have to abandon the Chequers Plan.”
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be servile.
We want to be able to enforce our laws in our country.”
Bone rejected opinions that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in Europe is completely false.”
Parliamentary Tory Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexit supporter, also attended the courthouse and told reporters: “I’m just telling the Prime Minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it does not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who turn around the streets to hunt down votes to allow us to be elected.
Let's lose the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In an incisive message to the May, she added: "Prime Ministers can keep their seat when they keep their promises."
At the committee, Farage said politicians should be able to “feel the pressure” if they intend to betray the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"It's now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't allow it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
“We intend to mobilize this country’s popular army that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour commission in the city centre.
A sweeping number of activists pushed the Tory against Brexit flags after the group formed this weekend.
The Labour Party has left conservatives behind for the security issues they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can install IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus agreement, for borders without attrition and for borderless trade in Ireland,” he added.
It's all a joke.
A good Brexit does not exist,” he concluded.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says after the November election she will seriously think about running for president.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democratic Senator on Saturday spoke about her future during a city assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, often criticizing President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
The assumption that he could challenge Trump in 2020 was in the air for a long time.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump settled.
One participant asked her if she wanted to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it is time for women to go to Washington to settle the government, and this implies that a woman takes the highest position.
Arrest for murder of LSU Sims player
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday said they had arrested a suspect for the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 on ETNews.
On Friday, he posted a video of the murder asking for help in identifying a man visible in the sequences.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims reported a gunshot wound to his head that caused his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on 247Sports.
Wayde intervened to defend a friend and was hit by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the crime scene in possession of a gun and had hit Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained at the Parish Police Department in East Baton Rouge.
A two-metre junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games last season, 10 of which were to hold with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When on Saturday Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of fellow Lewis Hamilton, it was immediately clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would severely condition the race.
From the pole, Bottas left Hamilton to defend against Vettel's attacks in the first two rounds.
Vettel is the first to stop at the boxes leaving Hamilton in the group's tail traffic, a move that could be decisive.
The Mercedes makes the stop the next lap by returning to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtakes it after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari driver tries to prevent it from passing in, risking to finish out after a double shift to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen starts from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first round is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then drives the race for much of the race without stopping at the boxes for tyre change and tries to finish quickly to overcome Kimi Raikkonen by winning fourth place.
In the end, however, he must make the pit stop at the 44th round and in the remaining 8 rounds he is unable to increase the step and overcome Raikkonen, who arrives fourth.
“It’s a difficult day because Valtteri has worked very well all weekend and it was really nice to have me through.
The team has done an exceptional job of winning first and second place,” Hamilton said.
A bad example of body language
At a committee held on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence on not revealing the contents of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
During an election in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate proves that people are “machines, evil and liars.”
"What can happen and what is happening in the last few days in the Senate where people are angry, messy, bad and liars," he said.
“When there are obvious signs that the news is being disclosed and the perpetrators say ‘oh no, it wasn’t me.
I could never do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember his answer... you revealed the contents of the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it... No, we didn’t,” she added, imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was released in early September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion was pierced by her office.
"I have not concealed Professor Ford's allegations, but I have not revealed her story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential, and I did."
But his denial is not credible for the president, who during the Saturday evening committee commented: "I say it, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but this is the worst example of body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of attempted sexual crime by three women, the president has suggested that Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
“They are trying to regain power by whatever means they need.
You see the messiness, the evil. They don’t care who hurt, who have to move on to regain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after Friday's defeat in the Elite League game against the Belfast Giants by winning the return race for 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants went on to score two goals on Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to the finish line before Dwyer brought the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored the match for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen’s two goals decreted their victory.
It was the third loss of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men who on Friday night in Belfast had relegated and won the match with Dundee for 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times this season and the Giants have won the first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal at 3:35 on Kendall McFaull's assist, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assist.
In what was a first time animated enough, Sullivan brought the home team back in the game at the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt provided the match assistant to Cownie at the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer decreed the advantage for the Giants by scoring the second goal of the evening at the end of the first season.
The home team rematched and Bouchard regained the match after a strategic maneuver at the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action that brought Dundee to the advantage for the first time in the match at the end of the second time and decreted his team's victory by scoring the fifth goal in the middle of the last time.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will play their next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape from earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after being killed to allow an aircraft carrying hundreds of people to take off and save them.
More than 800 people have died and many have been displaced by a very strong earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong settlement shocks continue to affect the area and many are trapped among the rubbish in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, twenty-one-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his place in the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which fluctuated bitterly.
He wanted to make sure that Batik Air 6321, which was on the track, was able to take off safely.
He then threw himself out of the control tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It's really sad news for us," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of casualties could reach thousands and the national disaster countermeasures agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to increase because many bodies are still under the rubbish and it has been impossible to reach many others," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to 6 meters have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be carried out on Sunday.
Military and commercial vehicles are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets are plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s army men: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation activities.
Are you ready?", according to CNN.
During the year, Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people were killed.
Air Disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini Now Says There Is a Disappearance After Lagoon Accident
The airline of the flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after stating that all 47 people on board among passengers and crew members had managed to save themselves, now claims that there is a missing person.
According to Air Niugini news, updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger is missing at the call.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
The local boats allowed the other passengers and crew to be rescued after the crash as the plane was trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, seven people were transported to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events are not yet clear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy say the plane crashed into the lagoon because it did not reach the track.
Some witnesses claim that the plane has crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane has arrived at a very low rate.
"And it was really a fortune," Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, were able to reach the aircraft's emergency exits.
He added that the flight attendants panicked and shouted and that he was slightly hit to the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working in the vicinity to set up a bridge provided relief using a boat to transport people on the shore before the plane crashed into about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that over the past two decades 111 people have died in airline aircraft crashes registered with PNG, but none of these involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night of the burnt woman alive
The prosecution’s trial against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014 ended on Saturday.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
She explained to the jury how she used the cell phone data to reconstruct the movements of the twenty-one-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the nineteen-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have retrieved location data from several cell phones that show that, contrary to what he said, Tellis was with the Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with the Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that that day was not in the city.
When the public prosecutor asked him if Tellis was telling the truth stating that night he was in the Sanford truck, the latter confirmed that he was "menting because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is the fact that Tellis has claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
The cell phone data indicates that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“She cancelled her out of her life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its concluding argument on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to go to the jury no later than the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge that negative view by inserting positive messages into their songs.
Bristol’s The High Breed group argues that hip-hop has drifted away from its origins as it spreads political messages and denounces social issues.
Instead, they want to go back to their origins and make again a kind of conscious hip-hop.
Artists like the Fugees and Commons have recently returned to the UK thanks to characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York Dad Cites A Couple In Court For Dismissing Her With A "Rassist" Text
In New York, a dad cited a couple in court for dismissing her discriminatoryly after she accidentally received a text in which her mother complained that she was "another black."
The couple denies being racist by comparing the demand to a real "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that her new dad, Giselle Maurice, arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOO AN OTHER NERA," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman "shamelessly" fired Mrs. Maurice saying she was not happy with their previous dad, an African-American, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
He paid Miss Maurice the working day and sent her home with a taxi.
Maurice cited the couple in court and, to be fired, demanded a beauty compensation of <0x24>350 per day for the six months of full-time work for which she was initially hired, though without a contract.
“I want them to understand that they can’t behave like this,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the accusation of racism saying that Maurice’s dismissal was the only thing to do because they feared they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message saying something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you trust your children to someone you've been rude to, even if by mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so."
By comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had just given birth for two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
“You can’t sleep with a person like that.
It’s not very kind behavior,” the financial adviser added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has immediately denounced the spouses on social media criticizing them sharply for their behavior and the logic followed.
A letter reveals that Paddington’s publisher feared readers would not appreciate a speaking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter as follows: "It is not easy to get into the hands of anyone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It’s fun now that we know the great success Paddington has earned.”
Affirming that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before writing the children’s book inspired by a toy bear, would not react well to the rejection of his work, he adds that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication was a bit “sad” after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family" adds that the father was modestly proud of his success.
“He was a fairly quiet man, not a presumptuous person,” he says.
“But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved like when you have a son who reaches a goal: you’re proud of it even if it’s not yours.
I think he interpreted Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, it attributed the merit to Paddington himself.”
I had to say goodbye on the phone to my daughter who was dying
On landing, the daughter was transported urgently to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter wouldn’t have done it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then she called me to tell me she was going to die in a few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines that doctors had given her to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly swelling.
She died a while ago and it was the end.
I had to sit down and wait and know that all this was going on.
I couldn’t complain, cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it.”
Eventually Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, saddened by the loss of her daughter, got on board the plane with the other passengers ignoring what was happening to her.
“Nobody knew,” he says.
“I’ve been crying all the time with my head down.
It’s hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her.”
Billets of Two Painful Women to Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide commit to prevent others from doing the same gesture.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked on a bridge in Wales tickets with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel like I feel every day,” she says.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that he illuminated every room he entered.”
But before he died he left the job because the depression had taken him “to a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he had taken his life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid that a chain effect will occur."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can contact to talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don’t have to isolate themselves, they have to talk.”
Humphreys, who has been Davies' friend for years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother's death.
“You never said you felt down or depressed,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On Christmas day, he touched the bottom, and when the children opened the gifts, he avoided looking them in the eyes."
He says his death was a huge trauma they had to deal with: "He has torn the family apart.
He's broken us up.
But we had to go ahead and fight.”

The Future of Brett Kavanaugh Is Uncertain: FBI Starts Investigation
"I think if we could proceed as he requested, that is, with a limited investigation in time and within the scope, we could reach an agreement," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "losing calm" because of the blockade of rooted supporters.
Why don't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
There are only five weeks left in the midterm elections, on 6 November. If Republicans as expected get a negative result, they will be severely weakened in their attempt to elect the man they chose for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators by pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI completes your report?
It will be voted in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the lengths and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of political refugees "diminishes" with Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Koreans seeking political asylum in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un rose to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, says the refugees were 1,127 last year versus 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park explains that the main reasons are a stricter control of the border between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs asked by those who illegally exit these people.
Pyongyang has not issued public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually given South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often returns them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have significantly improved in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to talk about the denuclearisation negotiations that are in a stalemate.
This comes after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general to collaborate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized U.S. sanctions for lack of developments since then.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national security, and in such circumstances there is no possibility that we proceed with unilateral disarmament first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi defines Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and claims it is not suitable for the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi defines Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and says he is not characteristically fit to cover such a position.
The Pelosi expressed this opinion in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman had behaved in the same way, they would have called her hysterical," the Pelosi said on Thursday in a statement made by Kavanaugh before the Senate Judicial Committee.
Visibly excited Kavanaugh denied the charge of sexually harassing Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was prey to emotion, almost screaming and with his throat tight from crying as he talked about his family and years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s Democrats who have called the charges against him a “absurd and coordinated defamatory campaign” organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
The Pelosi believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proves he can't go to the Supreme Court because he has proven to be prevented against Democrats.
“I think he’s self-excluded with his statements and the way he talked about Clinton and the Democrats,” he said.
The Pelosi then raised an objection when asked whether she would try to put Kavanaugh on trial in case it was confirmed and whether the Democrats should reach the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I think if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not only not suitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he presides now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeal for the District Circuit of Columbia.
The Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh eluded questions about his intentions to reverse certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said: “You cannot send a hysterical and partial person to the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be welcomed in a positive way.”
And women have to use it.
It’s a fair diatribe, months and years of anger attacks from which you can’t get out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And she continued, "A woman who was a leader somewhere helped me a lot. She told me that she was crying when she was angry too, but she had developed a technique that when she was angry and started crying she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then it went on.
I thought his was a brilliant idea.”
Tears are tolerated as an outpouring of anger in part because they are basically not understood.
One of the most neat memories I have of a previous job in a predominantly male office dates back to when I once started crying for an access to anger. A woman older than me, an ice manager from whom I was always a little scared, took me to the ladder and dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't ever let you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re happy because they’ve got you in their hands.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in her presidential race.
In 1987, when on a boat called Monkey Business was discovered Hart's extraconjugal relationship that had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason she should not have tried to run for the presidency herself.
“It wasn’t actually a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing about 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and no one else was definitely needed.
Some people call it "The Seven Whites and the Seven Rabbits."
Since the campaign was already in an advanced stage, Schroeder was late with fundraising and swore that she would not be a candidate if she hadn’t raised <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost cause in the beginning.
She found that some of the supporters who gave the men <0x24>1,000 to her would only give her 250.
"Do you think I can get a discount?" he asked.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (thank you for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger for the sexual discrimination she was the victim of), that she was overwhelmed.
“It looked like you were on the verge of a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled thinking about the reaction of the press.
“Someone could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my rock.
"Maybe he's crying a lot."
How the U.S.-China trade war could favor Beijing
The opening blows of the trade war between the US and China have been fraught and, while the battle is all but over, experts say a contrast between the two countries could be advantageous to Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump has already issued the first warning this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on items for more than <0x24>200 billion (175 billion euros) worth. This means that taxes will be applied on half of Chinese goods.
Beijing has reacted every time with measures of the same type by applying tariffs from five to ten percent on <0x24>60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. strike-on-hit and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will retreat soon.
Because Washington gives up, he would have to give up on his demands, but bending publicly to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US can positively affect China in the long run by diminishing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions of an economic collapse in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what has been recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher studying Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is “ready” for return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation in the territory is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million still living in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he will not accept any aid subject to conditions or by those countries that supported the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europa team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the USA team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US have lost six consecutive times on European soil and have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
U.S. Champion Phil Mickelson, who has fought for most of the tournament, launched his tee shot in the water at the 16th hole of par 3 granting the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his turns becoming one of the four players ever to record a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was first played in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated with a score of 5&4 by the Danish player Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, surrendered for 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia who played eight, became the European player who won the most in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t do it today.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m glad I won the cup again.
It’s a win for the team and I’m happy to have made my contribution,” Garcia said after the European victory.
Pass the witness to his compatriot John Ram who beat the legend of U.S. golf Tiger Woods with a 2&1 score in Sunday’s singles.
"If I think I grew up looking at his matches, I'm really very proud to have beat Tiger Woods," Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now the count of his Ryder Cup matches amounts to 13 wins, 21 losses and 3 draws.
A strange statistic if you think you are one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, according to only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been searching for fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the Europa team.
We've missed this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players have behaved very well.
I'll work with the U.S. PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I'm fond of these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We've put it all together.
But they played better than us.”
