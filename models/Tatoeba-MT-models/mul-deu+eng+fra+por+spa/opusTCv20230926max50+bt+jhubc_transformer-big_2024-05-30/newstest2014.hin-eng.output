There's a black box in your car.
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of funds to improve the depleted highway system, many people are looking at its solution in a small black box, which fits cleanly on your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by a motor-driven vehicle and transmits that information to the authorities, is nowadays too old to finance America's major roads. It's too old to get rid of the old-fashioned system and to plan for the state.
In general, boring work such as highway planning has suddenly become a matter of intense debate and vibrant alliances.
Keeping the details of the miles driven by you, and possibly the locations driven by you - and then using this information to prepare a tax bill - went along with the Libertarian Citizens' support to allow the government to use these black boxes.
The Tea Party is a party.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned about raising various types of privacy issues.
While Congress could not agree on whether to move forward or not, many states were not waiting.
They are discovering how they can go into such a system in the next decade, in which the driver pays for every mile determined on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken a black box for the test drive, some of which are GPS monitoring.
This is a very important thing for our country.
"It's not a matter of whether we choose or not to choose," says Hasan Ikharata, who is the executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which is planning to start tracking every mile determined by motorists in California by 2025.
There will be a change in the way in which we pay taxes.
There is technology to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's highway trust fund has become almost Diwali, which is financed by the payment of taxes on gas pumps by U.S. citizens.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Now a gallon of gas drives more than a mile before.
Federal taxes have not increased in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Due to the high price of gas, politicians also avoid raising a money in taxes.
Lee Munick, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota, says, "Gas tax is not transportable at all."
His state has recently installed a tracking device in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "In the long run it will work as the most reasonable option."
Wonx calls it a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea looks good to urban liberals, because it can change taxes to change the way they drive, for example, which can help to reduce jams and reduce greenhouse gases.
California's planners are keen on this system as they are developing strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip. Bill Shuster (A.-P.A.) also considers the Black Box to be the most viable long-term option.
Free sellers in the Rijan Foundation are also in favour of paying per mile by the driver.
"""It's not the only thing that's going to go in the blind pits,""" the vice-president of politics in Rijana, Adrian Moore, said."
People are paying more directly for what they're getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. transport secretaries, who in their report in 2011 commended to move forward towards per-mile payments from Congress.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a <0x24>90-million test project involving 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural legislators, who were representing individuals who had to walk too many miles to go to work or to go to the city every day, the House leadership ended that proposal at the same time.
Yet many states and cities themselves are moving in this direction.
It has the most desirable oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
The drivers will soon pay the mileage fee instead of gas to the state.
Nevada has already completed the preliminary test.
The city of New York is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is testing with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 Alliance, which includes 17 State Transport Departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) with the Eastern Seaboard, is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea was not supported in all places.
In Nevada, where this device was installed on the cars of 50 volunteer car drivers a few days ago, the driver was very impatient to think that the government could monitor each step of theirs.
Alauddin Khan, who directs the strategic and operational management in the Nevada Transport Department, says, "The concern about Big Brother and other similar things was a major problem."
Itâ€™s not what people wanted.
As the test progressed, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It will be fairly easy to convert this device into a complete tracking device."
There is no need to develop a vast, unmanageable technology structure, which must be disseminated in order to keep records of each person's daily coming-to-go.
Nevada is one of the many states that is making every effort to get portable technology, with the help of which the state can get a detailed description of how many miles the car runs every day, but not where and when it runs.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
The company was originally not in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers had to pay based on their mileage.
But it's the device that's testing, it's good for highway planners, as it doesn't use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at a certain time interval.
"If you don't track people's pace and their location, they'll be more willing to adopt this method,"" said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage."
Some major mistakes have been made in these early programs of the state.
There are also very low-cost and low-interference ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are trying to give drivers different options.
They can choose the device of G.P.S. with or without G.P.S.
Or again, no one can choose not to take any device, but rather to pay fees determined on the basis of the average miles determined by the residents of the state.
In other places, it is hoped that this concept could be sold to concerned citizens by providing less and more convenience in the device.
In New York City, transport officers are trying to develop such a taxing device, which will also have the facility to pay the parking meter fee, will provide "save to pay to be paid according to your drive" insurance, which will provide "save to be paid" to the drivers, and timely to the other drivers.
The City Planning Document states, "Motors-drivers will be attracted to participation in it due to the benefits resulting from it."
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps the whole discussion on payments is a major distraction according to miles.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that by increasing Congress gas taxes, Diwalia could deal with the problem of highway trust fund very easily.
Additional one-time or annual fees may also be imposed on hybrid or other car drivers whose vehicles do not use too much gas in order to pay their fair share.
The Commission's Director of Legislation and Public Affairs, Randy Rentsheller, said, "When it is possible to work with aspirin, what is the basic need for a surgical procedure for it."
If we do, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, his death was due to drowning.
Alabatta, his friend has been detained by police on charges of concealing the goods of the deceased with him.
The police have submitted the final report of the death investigation in the court.
On 26 August, police recovered the body of Jahid Ikbal, who lived in Padshahi Garden in Zhelam Daria.
His relatives had accused him of murdering his friends because he was missing his cell phones and other belongings.
In the report, the police said the deceased's phone and SIM were examined and found to be being used by a woman in the sauna.
The woman said in an interview that the phone had been given to her by a relative, Rohal Gauhr.
Ruhiel also lives in the parish garden and he was a friend of the late Jihad.
Ruhail was born in Zhelam with Jahid after prayer-e-jumma on August 25.
Jahid opened his clothes and put all his belongings on the edge, while Rohal went to the other side to drink cigarettes.
When he came back, Jahid wasn't there, he was just dressed.
Rohal searched for Jahid, but he did not find him.
He picked up his mobile phones, watches, and other items and kept them for use.
He didn't tell anyone that Jahid had drowned.
The police told the court that the death of Jahid was due to drowning and it has also been confirmed in the post-mortem.
Alabatta, Rohal has been detained under section 404 for concealing facts and belongings of the deceased.

Former Prime Minister of Italy, 77-year-old Silvio Berlusconi, has married a 28-year-old girl in a highly intelligent manner.
The announcement was made by his family friend Marthel Polanko.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been Prime Minister three times, has married former TV anchor Francisca Pascal in his private chapel.
Francisca's encounter with Balusconi was when she was a teenage activist at the Forza Italia Party.
It is Francesca, whose relationship with Balrusconi has been said to be a demonstration of his relationship.
Berlusconi's close friend and Bungalow-Bungalow girl Marthel Polanco has revealed that she was also invited to this intelligence wedding.
The ceremony was held three weeks ago.
In an announcement on Italian Radio2, when asked what would happen if the two were to get married, Polanko said that the two were already married.
It was not a public ceremony.
The wedding took place in a private chapel in the house of the former Prime Minister.
No one can say anything other than that.
However, she did not get married.
He has sent his congratulations to the newcomer.
They both got married about three weeks ago, i.e. on October 8 or 9.
About 8 months ago, a 50-year-old 28-year-old woman was engaged to Francesca Pascal.
In order to avoid Kirkiri, Barlusconi had laid the groundwork for solitude behind this decision.
In the lower areas, the rain continued to stall between the sun's eyelids and the sun's rays.
With this, the whole plaintiff has started cold weather.
The cold can be estimated by the fact that the minimum temperature in Srinagar has reached 4.8 degrees Celsius, -0.2 degrees below zero in Gulmarg and -1.8 degrees Celsius in Leh.
It was the coldest in the whole state.
At the same time, the Srinagar-Leh National Highway has closed for traffic, which is strategically important due to rain and snowfall.
Heavy snowfall has taken place on the Jojila dairy.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall in the hills of Kashmir.
Due to the activity of western whistle-blowers, the storms began rainy seasons in the high mountain areas of the plaintiff and in the lower areas, which continued until late evening.
The general population was also affected by the cold.
People were stranded in the houses to avoid the cold.
In the meantime, power supply has also been discontinued in many areas.
The maximum temperature of the day in Srinagar was recorded four degrees below normal at 13.7 degrees Celsius.
In Jammu and Kashmir, the temperature has also increased due to heavy rains.
In Jammu, a minimum temperature of 16.6 and a maximum of 27.0 degrees Celsius was recorded.
According to the Meteorological Department, the impact of western recession has occurred and will improve in the weather from Friday.
According to Sonam Lots, director of the Weather Department in Srinagar, the plaintiff is likely to stay dry in the weather from 1st November to 7th November.
Asaram, who was imprisoned on charges of sexual harassment, was once again disappointed by the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage filed on behalf of Asaram, he is being presented as a children's blood-drinking dracula, but the court rejected his request to stop the media coverage.
Chief Justice P. Satshivam's back, refusing to order the media to stop running news about Asaram, said that he has seen every word reported in the media and there is no reason to interfere with it.
When the police and other people are getting information, how can we stop them?
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer had accused the media that he was showing up-and-coming news about them.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They filed a case against whom, but the back was not affected by these allegations and, refusing to intervene in the case, said they had other options.
Earlier, the court had once demanded a halt to Asaram's media coverage.
The department officials claim that this is the largest case of TDS theft so far.
The Mall's group director paid the relevant financial institutions by cutting TDS, but did not pay it in the government treasury.
In doing so, the TDS was depositing Rs.
On 17th October, the Mumbai-based exploration team took action in conjunction with the Jaipur exploration team.
The same tight investigation found that this merchant had cut the TDS but had not deposited.
For this reason, the TDS team on Thursday initiated the action of the Income Tax Survey on the group.
The risk of account sealing had been printed and surveyed on the group of the mall manager about 15 days ago.
Angry at this action, the trader has made it clear to the Income Tax Department officials that they are not ready to pay the TDS to the Income Tax Department at the moment.
The Income Tax Department is continuously targeting them.
The investigating authorities in this case have clarified that the recovery action will be taken by sealing the account in the event of non-payment.
The demand for sweets is increasing with the view of Diwali.
With this in mind, sales of fake and fake goods are increasing.
It is used to make sweets and chemicals bright, colorful and sweet, which are dangerous to health.
The Department of Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against fake mava and chemical sweets.
The department seized 70,000 mawa from Madhya Pradesh and 5000 from Quetta Colony.
The demand for sweets in the market has also increased as well as the demand for diminishing demand from Madhya Pradesh.
Zhtia Mave, who was put in the garbage, was informed by the department of bringing Nagpur from Madhya Pradesh.
Nagpur is being transported from Mave Garage to Khepe Nagpur.
The department took possession of this tax, which was declared at Rs 70,000.
Fear of action did not allow anyone to claim it.
The Department destroyed it by comparing the unclaimed (unclaimed) property.
The department has recovered nearly 5,000 sparks by printing on the Gitendra Caters in Quetta Colony.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulphite was used to brighten and last for more days.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
S.S. Deshmukh, Co-Commissar of the Department, said that the campaign will continue to capture chemical sweets and nuts and fake mave.
In the next few days, the campaign and information on speeding up has been provided by the Department.
These sweets can also be poisoned by the intake of these sweets.
The department asked the sweet businessmen to make good milk, mave sweets.
The appeal has been made to the people on behalf of the Department to be cautious of fake sweets and mave.
42 senior leaders of the BJP, who were elected by the BJP, gave their strong condolences at the airport.
It is noteworthy that Modi has come to Bihar for a condolences visit organized by the BJP.
The Sanjayna Journey is an event for the families of the people killed in the blasts in Patna, BJP said.
It should be noted that a total of seven blasts took place in Patna on 27th October during Narendra Modi's hurricane rally.
Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts had been rallied during the Bhagdadar rally, so that more people would be evacuated and become the atmosphere of terror in the country.
The terrorists were not successful, but six people were killed in the blasts.
All of them have been declared by the BJP as martyrs.
The party's leaders have been taking asthi-kalsh from their village on Thursday.
On November 5, all of these weapons will be flown together in the Ganga in Patna.
As a part of this journey, the Consolation is the organization of the journey.
The main character is Narendra Modi.
They will go to the village of the people killed in the blasts at 7 a.m. on Saturday and meet their families.
During the meeting, they will also provide the families of the deceased with a check of five to five rupees.
The announcement of this financial aid has already been made by the BJP.
The Indian team, enthusiastic for the batting victory in the previous match on Saturday when M Chinnaswami will land in the seventh and final ODIs against Australia at the stadium, will have to take on the series with a win.
India had recently won the Nagpur ODI to remain in the series after two consecutive ODIs after being dumped due to the rain and his batsmen beat him the record, giving him a 2-2 draw in the series.
In the series, India have scored the goal of over 350 runs twice, and once again the team will be responsible for crossing the naia over the batsmen.
Indian batsmanship is at the extreme at the moment and a bigger goal is also being proved to be a buzz in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in strong form, but the team will also have special expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Rana and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as the question of opening is concerned, Rohit and the team as the summit have found a salute pair that is facilitating the work of the rest of the batsmen from a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had given Virat the opportunity to play without any pressure while making a great partnership in the opening.
Kohli is considered to be Sachin Tendulkar of the future as the third-placed Virat.
However, many cricketers have given them a better deal than Sachin.
Virat has won 17 ODIs over the 25th anniversary of next week, with India scoring 16.
While pursuing the goal, his average is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the best finisher.
The top three batsmen in India are in strong form, but there can also be a loss for the highly dependent team on these three.
Rana and Yuvraj were badly flopped in the last match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open accounts in two matches in the series.
In this way, the Bengaluru ODI will be able to work a good 'Lifeline' for him.
As far as Australia is concerned, his batsmen, especially Captain George Bally, have been impressed by his performance.
He is also demanding to join the Test team for the domestic Ashes series against England.
Australia has the best batsmen to the ninth place.
In addition to Beley, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Vogs and James Fockner have played well in the series.
However, Phil Hughes and Aaron Finch did not leave any effect in the opening.
The shortage of Michelle Johnson in the bowling match could be severe for Australia.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly so far in the series, has been sent home to prepare for the Ashes series.
Dr. Jitendra Singh, a member of the BJP National Executive, said that Pakistan is working on a new policy to invade terrorists in the wake of this demonstration of peace.
Referring to a report by intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here on Wednesday that Pakistan is pushing for a high-risk summit to invade nearly 2,000 terrorists prepared in its training camps.
For this reason, there will never be peace on the border.
Pakistan has also been devastated by the massive failure of separatists to exacerbate the situation in Kashmir.
Referring to last year's Pakistani visit of separatists, the BJP leader said ISIS chief Lieutenant-General Jahir Ul Islam, Lashkar, Hezb's Shahikan Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahudin had believed that in 2014, Diyakwa
"Pakistan is committed to the fulfillment of this promise.
The killings of soldiers on the border, the suicide attacks in Samba, Herangar are part of the same strategy.
The BJP leader, calling for the abolition of military privileges in the state under such circumstances, said it is counter-productive to do such things until there is a lasting peace in the state.
These are the anti-government elements.
He stressed that the army of leaders, the morally degrading statements of the security forces should be stopped.
Snow Dan ready to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. borders
Edward Snow Dan, the U.S. intelligence spokesman, has announced that he is ready to travel to Berlin to testify to parliament in Germany if he is in the U.S. National Security Agency and his director, Keith Alexander, about his activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Stroh Belle met Mr. Snow Dane on Thursday in Russia, where he was given shelter to talk about the testimony in Germany.
"While the results of my efforts are demonstrably positive, my government considers disagreement with the party as a means of change-promotion," Shri Snow Dane said in a letter presented to the media in Berlin on Friday.
However, to tell the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Dan said he believes that the support of the international community could appeal to the U.S. government to bring criminal charges against him.
The allegations filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include theft from intelligence and government property.
Hans Peter Frederick, German Interior Minister, told online Zeit: "Mr. Snow Dan is ready to talk to German officials, so we will have to find ways to make it possible."
Relations between the U.S. and Germany have come under pressure as the NSA has claimed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone has been mistaken.
Thomas Operman, MP who is the chairman of the parliamentary committee, supervises intelligence. He said that if Mr. Snow Dan had the opportunity to listen as a witness, "should completely destroy relations with the United States," even without putting them in danger.
Mr. Belle, a member of the Green Party of Germany, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snow Dan on Twitter feed.
He said he was on his trip to Russia with two German journalists.
Mr. Bellene said, according to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, if he left Russia, Snowden would not be able to return to Russia.
If Snow Dan testified in Germany, he would be "safe" there where he would need assurances, the MP said.
Mr. Snow Dan said in his letter that "they had to face cowardice and constant campaign" because he had to be forced to leave the house.
However, he said that the world is happy and impressed by the widespread responses "to its work of political expression."
U.S. Citizens, as well as senior officials in the world, have assessed the discovery of an irresponsible system of a comprehensive public service surveillance.
The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with German officials "when the problems of the humanitarian situation have been solved."
Frontier Airlines Carry-On Baggage Charges
Frontier Airlines plans to charge <0x24>100 to carry luggage for passengers on board their aircraft - on-store.
A cargo-on-bag at Frontier Airlines is scheduled to start charging for <0x24>100 and it will charge <0x24>2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday announced that passengers can keep the entire box.
New Carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, so, small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said it would charge <0x24>25 if paid in Advances, <0x24>100 would have to wait if passengers wait to pay until they are at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said that <0x24>100 percent of passengers have to reach to take care of the charge in the advans.
"We don't want to charge it," he said.
The airline started charging for the first and second check bags in 2008.
This means that those who are trying to avoid the passenger fees are filling up as much as they can in the carry-on baggage that is stacked in the overhead drawer, this often means there is less space in this drawer.
There is a way to reduce the fee on board for passengers.
O'Malley said it's not really about raising new charges.
Itâ€™s become increasingly difficult for the most loyal customers about Frontier to find a place for overhead bin.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website do not have to give it.
This means that the next person in the line may have to give <0x24>100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in the line at a front gate can get a bag for free.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and checking these processes are being changed to ensure that passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate.
The new charge of the Frontier - on fees, will not begin until summer although a date has not been set.
Passengers often show dissatisfaction about baggage fees and other fees, but the airline service likes them.
They argue that the money is spent on handling the luggage, and that those who want passenger service should pay for it.
The fees of luggage on Wall Street are seen by many as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
Most of the carriage-on-bag fees are not even touched.
Spirit Airlines Inc. first launched Carry-on-Tax three years ago, and partner Discounter Allegiant Air later.
Along with such a fee is another airline of Hungary's Wizz Air, which airline advisor J Sorensen said, and which tracks the add-on-on fees.
He said Spirit's Carry-On Fee brings <0x24>50 million a year, which was estimated in a December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former official of Midwest Airlines, recently flew to Spirit and was surprised to see passengers carrying them on the gate face an unusual baggage fee.
"The boarding process that I saw in my airline career was easy," he said.
I was hoping to grind my teeth and look out at a battle gate.
"The wind was full and he said it was lickety-split."
Frontier is also following the Spirit's <0x24>2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier well that those who take soda, or juice can keep the whole box, and it will give free coffee only for once.
It will still remove the water.
U.S. Airways briefly tried to charge for beverages in 2008, but seven months later after passengers complained they withdrew and no other major airlines followed after being there.
If Frontier's passengers do not purchase directly from the airline, then Carry-on is Frontier's step to charge the fee on its own website is its freshest attempt to operate its own customers.
The airline pays the online travel seller the <0x24>10 to <0x24>25 for each ticket sold for such <0x24>10 to <0x24>25.
That's why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from those people, rather than to go through an online travel agency.
The frontier, however, has progressed in this area.
In September, many often paid off flights at a distance of half the mile for customers who had purchased from these individuals from an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the Mileage Award to 25 per cent of the trip mile.
So, a 1000-mile Frontier Trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn a distance of 250 miles.
It also allows only passengers to choose their seats in advance upon purchase directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business is declining and it is losing money.
Revenue has fallen by 9 per cent and its flight capacity has declined by about 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republican airline is trying to decide the finances of Frontier as part of the sale.
The NSA accused the website of "internal error" instead of hackers for crashing the website
The secretive National Security Agency said on Friday that due to some technical shortcomings, our website had shut down for a few hours, not because of hackers, as some claimed online.
"The NSA.gov was not in reach for several hours tonight, which was due to an internal error occurring during the pre-determined update,"" the intelligence agency said in a statement.
Tonight, this problem will be solved.
It is not true that this obstruction, distributed denial of service came due to [D.O.S.] attack.
On the evening, online server trackers found that NSA's website was closed for at least six hours, and the site is not yet accessible to some users.
A spokesman for NSA told ABC News that there was no "absolutely" deal with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesman said that no classified information is at risk.
At least one hacktivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA's website by D.D.O.S. attack.
The D.D.O.S. attack is designed in such a way that the target site sends so much traffic until the site is closed due to server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively undeveloped and the aim of the attacks is not to discriminate against the internal network of the system.
K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K. K.
Due to such a growing controversy over the agency, following the incident this evening, such disclosures were made that the incident was the result of the targeted cyber operation.
A beautiful expression was presented in accordance with the narrative 'A and Dronacharya', which shows consistency in the times and circumstances of today.
It has been shown in what fleets in today's outlook a guru is bound to walk on the wrong path.
The opening of the theater was held jointly by Chief Guest MLA Prabhupadayal Walmiki, Deputy Chairman Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Council and Shakti Singh in the House of St. Joseph Inter College.
The play reflected the dronacharya of the Dupar era and the prevalence of the circumstances of a professor Arvind at present.
Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bachchan, Hemant Goyal, Borda Samar, Vanishidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc.
In the play, the lighting system was designed by young colour worker Jitendra C. Raj and set by Hemant Kumar.
Various awards were given to literary, cultural contributors on behalf of Apta at the subsequent ceremony.
Dr. Asalam Jamshedpuri, Senior Journalist Shambhunat Shukla and Colorist Jitendra C. Raj, were also awarded the award.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rijvi, etc. contributed to the success of the event.
Decrease in Bombardier's profits as the delivery of the aircraft, decrease in orders
Canada's aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc. reported a 15 per cent drop in net profit as pressured by aircraft orders and deliveries in its railway unit in the third quarter and less on contract issues.
The Montreal-based Bombardier has also not presented an update on the issues of releasing any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or completing its ambitious program to go into commercial service from next September.
About one and a half months after the first flight of the test aircraft, it has been flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test stage is on track.
The result fell below the forecast and was sent to more than 8 per cent for sliding on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
A stock analyst with Cameron Dorsen, National Bank Financial, has reduced its rating for "area performance" from "matt" on Thursday to "area performance" over the next one or two quarters.
"We were mostly expecting weak aircraft deliveries, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transport," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive a new order for the Bombardier CSeries as the progress of the flight test program.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, it is doubtful that the market program will be squeezed.
Bombardier expects the aircraft family can now cut it off at the low end of the supermarket of Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after a month of delay.
Potential buyers are awaiting the flight test results to validate the company's claims on new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings, but as for CSeries, the insurance order is up to 177 mediums.
403 complete orders and commitments are available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boudoin believed that Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet comes into commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was running according to the schedule.
"The test aircraft remained on the ground longer than anticipated," Boudouin said in a conference call, adding that it was also determined during the landing of the aircraft's testing and software updates.
Each manufacturer creates schedules in a different way.
We had decided to make a first flight and an update period and said what we have done.
That's why everything will be done through the flight program.
The other remaining part of the five test aircraft, with the following shortly after, is expected to fill the flight in the coming weeks, the company said.
However, analysts believe that customers are doubtful that they can start a CSeries aircraft operation after their first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier has said that the entry service (EIS) schedule has been evaluated and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow speed of the flight test - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - confirms our view that the service will be pushed into entry in Q1/15," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ending September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to <0x24>147million a year ago, or 8 cents per share, <0x24>172million, or 9 cents per share.
The adjusted income per share was unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue decreased from <0x24>4.2 billion to <0x24>4.1 billion.
According to analysts Thomasson Reuters I/B/E/S, 10 cents per share and a revenue of <0x24>4.56 billion were expected.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said 45 aircraft were delivered below 57 a year ago, during the quarter.
Pure order dropped from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The backlog in the aerospace division was <0x24>32.9 billion on September 30, no change since December 31.
"Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the consumption of the following order and overall market situation were a disappointment," Boudoin said.
A 13 per cent drop in aerospace revenues to <0x24>2 billion.
Bombardier said the world's largest train manufacturer had increased revenues by about 11 percent to <0x24>2.1 billion in the division.
The order in the transport unit was backloged to about <0x24>32.6 billion on September 30, up slightly from December 31.
Some major contracts in the margins of the transport department were also affected by issues of execution.
Executive officials said the new guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, in which Google Inc's chief financial officer Patrick Pichett announced joining the board, were also down 8.5 percent at C<0x24>4.83 in mid-afternoon trading on Thursday.
Brazil's Embrayer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest rival to Bombardier, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
New research has found that we work with complete honesty and dedication in the morning.
You don't lie to anyone and you don't think about stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our minds change and we begin to keep the ideal on one side against the rules.
Researchers from Harvard University and Utah's David Eccles School of Business have given a number of interesting facts.
According to the researchers, when there is no stress at work in the morning, we tend to set moral values, but when there is fatigue or more pressure in the evening, honesty decreases.
Researchers have made two experiments for this.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people were told that the point is higher on the left or on the right.
The participants were told that if they give the wrong answer instead of the right answer, they would be given money.
In this experiment, it was seen that the people who were used between 8 a.m. and 12 a.m. did not make any mistakes and answered correctly.
While using people between 12:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., it was found that he deliberately misrepresented his recoveries.
Researchers have been able to prove that our honesty does not matter with the passion of money in the morning, but at night we stop giving up morality.
This research has been published in the latest edition of Psychological Sciences.

Shri Big is imprisoned by the usual lawyer of Cocaine who gave secret information about the police investigation
42-year-old Bashartha Ditta reported to the famous criminal Neil Scarborough
The lawyer thought that people might be aware of his secret drug addiction.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
The defense's top lawyer, who told Mr. Big about the Chief Police Investigation, because he was afraid, will tell people about his secret addiction to his drug addiction, has been sentenced to three years.
The 42-year-old Barashat Ditta, after compromising his cocaine addiction, provided the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough with sensitive confidential information about the investigation of his drug-trafficking activities.
This lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash", and whose criminals praised as "top brief", was arrested from his home in the year 2011 following the police surveillance operation in Scarborough. Protestant was arrested from his home, which he had not been charged with
Officials had seen Scarborough, 32, holding three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancaster, while she had gone out for a law society dinner with her colleagues.
After finding cocaine particles in Detta's hair, wallets, and credit cards, the investigation found that Detta was a "regular user" of drug addiction of category A.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain illegal information on the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough and his associates.
All four suspects were being monitored by police at the time as part of the main investigation of the heroin and cocaine group operating in Lancashire, Kumbria, Merceside, Burkeshire and West Yorkshire.
It included 32 other people who were sent to prison after being seized more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash and costing <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million in heroin and cocaine during multiple imprints by the police.
The 42-year-old Detta provided information to criminals because she was afraid that people would not be aware of her cocaine addiction.
Detta, who worked at Firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty in two cases after a three-week trial in the Liverpool Crown Court, after being found guilty of obstructing the way of justice
He had agreed to keep cocaine in the hearing before.
The bad time for the lawyer began when police found out while investigating Scarborough that he had been in regular contact on the phone with Ditta since February 2011.
Two spies chased the suspect and saw him coming to the house of Detta and keeping the drug with more than 60 percent purity under the bar of the lawyer in the Black Golf Glove.
The drug was regularly contacted by phone with Scarborough Detta, who had gone out for dinner at Blackren Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park after being kept.
Upon arriving at the house, the lawyer found out that the drug was stored there and that there was a nine-time conversation between them.
He was found to be a "regular user" of cocaine in the trial when a drug of category A was found on Ditta's hair, wallets and credit cards.
Detta was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine and said he was talking to the suspect dealer because he was his client and said his discussion was about "legal privileges".
During his arrest, Detta tried to remove a lot of credit cards by withdrawing his wallet, but he was seized, and his hair was sampled.
He said in a police interview that he was running offices from his workplace as well as from his home, and his client was calling at his home for legal matters.
After being told by the arrested main persons what the spy knew about them, the court said in the hearing that Ditta Nashili was calling the chiefs of the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously filed a case.
On behalf of the prosecution, Annie White said, "The criminal lawyer should know best about not breaking the law."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, of being too much associated with his specific client.
We are not talking about the relationship of a regular drug dealer, but rather about a dealer who is providing drug to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly be legal without any doubt, as he was a lawyer.
But he went somewhere beyond his limits of the lawyer-client relationship.
He interrupted the police investigation as much as possible so that they were able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Detta was not respecting his profession, but was insulting.
He made a lot more close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed him to negotiate with his independence.
Detta denied any wrongdoing and claimed that: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I want to inform Mr Scarborough, I do not wait for 15 hours, but I do it immediately.
But after the hearing, Lee Hallstead, Superintendent of Lancaster Police, said: "Sri Detta, at the time he started receiving drug from organised criminals, at the same time he turned himself from criminal prosecutor to criminal prosecutor."
Due to his cocaine addiction, he made an excessive compromise and became too weak for the purposes of the leading members of organized crime groups, who used him to receive important information related to the police investigation.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of truthfulness, and should fill in trust and self-confidence in people.
Shri Detta has cheated with this belief and has tried to avoid his profession in the dirt.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lankashair examined Mr. Ditta, in which he was also found guilty of three incidents of keeping him cocaine and now obstructing the path of justice, which is our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals that no person is beyond the reach of the law.
We will take you out of the investigation and present you before the Court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of drugging for supplying heroin, cocaine and bang.
Fifty other members of the group were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug offences.
On his website, Detta gave a session of questions and answers about himself, in which he said that his fantasy job would be to become a lawyer for a client with the death penalty in the United States, to be Mohamed Alina's dinner guest and inequality for his work.
Kenya's press on controversial media law is outraged
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional, saying, "This is a terrible place, and it is legitimate to ask: What is to prevent Parliament from depriving the judiciary of its independence tomorrow?"
Capital Group - which is the director company of the most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM., Sirs Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group, said, "This is a law that is cruel and very depressing."
He said the new media court "will always remain pro-government because it is a member of the government" and said that banning the subject matter and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.
"""I hope that the President will listen to our speech, and we appeal to them to send the M.P. people back by rejecting this bill,"" he said."
According to The Star Newspaper, the new bill will provide the government with "strict control over the media," while DiStandard said that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "has collapsed" and described the bill as cruel.
The bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security following an attack by Islamic gunmen at the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenya's media had broadcast the security camera footage of the raids sent to the attacking site, in which he had shown intentional looting of the mall, causing officials to be angry with Kenyan media.
Police chief David Kimyo had sent the summon to two journalists and a media worker for interrogation, although the sum was taken back after the media harassment.
Under the new bill, 2 crore Kenyan shillings and 10 lakh Kenyan shillings may be fined on media companies under the new bill and, furthermore, "removed from the list" or the official press is not accredited
If the penalty is not paid, the Court also has the right to seize the property of the offender.
According to the Daily Nation, "A single sentence is enough to move the foundation of most FM stations."
It also said that these measures could have the devastating effect described in Kenya as the "living blogosphere".
Politicians know by shutting the mouths of the media that they can do their will.
The nation's journalist Mutuma Matthew Kenya writes describing Kenyan media as the main source of control and balance in public life, "Nobody will ever know."
"""If left to the rulers, they will bring us back to the era of hunting and depositing by diwaliating the country."
In the past, Kenyan legislators have faced the anger of the people.
In May, he had voted in favour of rejecting the cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission, and had recovered about 532,000 shillings per month, tax-free flat wage, which is considered to be the world's highest.
The birthday of the world's richest Indian Mukesh Ambani's wife is one November, but as soon as the clocks played on the night of October 30, the entire Jodhpur Nita started to sneak out of Ambani's birthday.
Earlier, the atmosphere of the celebration had become entirely the performance of the team of AR Rehman.
Rehman presented his signature sangs at this musical night beginning at 8 p.m.
Priyanka Chopra was on the stage for the beautiful colours of the dance.
Nearly 32 charters arrived in Jodhpur for the guests who participated in the Barth Day of Nita Ambani.
Due to reduced parking space at Jodhpur Airport, the charter was parked in Jaipur, Delhi, Udaipur and Jodhpur.
Similarly, 135 luxury cars, including BMW Luu and Jugarr, were transported.
"""The cleanup system in the city, street lights have completely failed,"" Sood said."
No steps are being taken by the Municipal Corporation and Huda to run the city centre of Panchkula.
He has demanded that Panchkula be completely terminated from home.
Speaking to a press conference here on Friday, VK Sud said the city has received new mayors and mayors after the elections, but they do not have the power to work.
As a result, the mayor of the city has become a dammit and the officers are working on their own account.
"""The City Corporation has been holding millions of rupees, but all the money is being recovered by depositing it as a FD in the banks,"" he said."
However, no action is being taken to invest in the development of the city.
VK Sood said the problem of the dumping ground is the most serious.
People living in the Ghaggar cross-sectors are forced to live a narcissistic life over the past several years due to the creation of doping grounds in Sector 23.
City Corporation officials have been talking about shifting the doping grounds in the village of Zhurywala for the past several years, but people in the Barwala area are already getting two to four from the serious problem of the butterflies.
"""The state of health services and education system in the villages has deteriorated completely,"" he said."
To date, no work has been started to provide facilities to people in the rural area.
The U.N. has set new targets for addressing poverty.
The United Nations will immediately begin work on a new set of targets, which will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to address global poverty.
To replace the M.D.D. ending in 2015, the Australian diplomat launched overnight in Rio de Janeiro to advance the "Consumer Development Goals" just before the Consumable Development Summit.
They were included in the final format of the document, which will be supported by world leaders including Ms. Galard during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the evening summit that the time has come to rise above national interests.
"""I am very pleased that the Member States have agreed to initiate the process to establish the Global Sustainable Development Goal and take ownership of it,"" he said."
These SDGs will be based on our development under the Millennium Development Goals, and they will be an integral part of the development framework after 2015.
I will make every effort to implement the mandate given to me by our member countries to meet our far-reaching goals of MDGs based on the success of MDGs.
Mozambique's security concerns are growing as powerful personalities clash
With a statue of President Samora, founder of Mozambique, who was rolling down on them, thousands gathered in the Central Maputo for peace talks in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back, we want stability," said Vanesa de Susa, a chief executive of an investment company.
Fearing the future of his country, he changed his corporate outfit from "We're asking for security" in Acapulco and joined the crowd of the capital's Freedom Square on Thursday.
The conflict between the government forces and Ray Namo has been reported almost daily for two weeks, more than 20 years ago from a peace deal.
Ray Namo was once a notorious rebel of the movement backed by the white-run Rhodesia and South Africa governments, as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely to return to the country's full-fledged struggle, but recent events have confounded foreign investors and locals.
Bets are high for the fast-growing economy of the West's massive offshore gas stockpile and coal stockpile exploration could bring some of the companies including Rio Tinto, Brazil, Eni from investments of more than <0x24>50bn next year.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the leading political power since 1975, and Ray Namo have blamed each other for tension.
Rae Namo says the government launched the latest fight by launching attacks on its members in Sofa la Province, a traditional Rae Namo Gharh, on October 17
The attack on the former insurgents and the rise of government forces has attacked the Renmo sites and told the Financial Times about attempting to kill the spokesman of the group, Fernando Majung, and Re Namo.
The government accuses Ray Namo of attacking the troops and blames the clash for triggering the attack.
President Armando Jibuzhan has underestimated concerns about volatility.
Mr. Gibuzhan told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "here" "anything has remained to try to prove his armies that he can implement his own decision on the government."
Free Limo and Ray Namo both insist that they want to avoid the war.
Shri Mazhang was quoted as saying that Ray Namo had cancelled the 1992 peace agreement but later became the subject of concern.
He told the FT that the agreement is not being honoured by Free Limo
"Our vision is to come back for the compromise negotiations, but seriously," said Mr. Mazhangane.
The last talks between the two sides did nothing special to reduce the tension of a series of conflicts this year.
"This is about two big men fighting together (Gubuzhan and Dhakama)," said a lecturer and Mozambique expert at the University of London Open.
None of them are good negotiators, nor do they need to be willing to make a kind of concession.
Ray Namo, who is pushing for election reforms, had already said about the expulsion of the municipal corporation elections in November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force as an attempt by a patient movement to win concessions from the government and financial looting.
Ray Namo's share in the vote has been declining since 1992, while a new party, created by a former Ray Namo member in which Mozambique's Democratic Movement (MDM), is expected to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Mazhang said Mr. Jibuzhanko - who is leaving office at the end of his second term next year - wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He doesn't want multilateral democracy, he doesn't want to leave the presidency because he doesn't want peace, he doesn't want transparent elections," Mazhang said.
What kind of capacity Ray Namo has not been clarified, but it has been a major north-south highway and a disruptive hit and run tour on police stations and vehicles.
Most of the clashes are in the province of Sofa la, several hundred kilometres north of Jomaputo, with hosts of Bera ports that rely on mining, coal exports including Rio Tinto and the Valley.
After threatening to attack the Ray Namo line, the railway suspended its experiment for nearly a week in Rio in June.
Ray Namo was Mr. Mazhangvinit when asked whether or not to repeat this threat.
"The things that were not going well in Mozambique that wanted to bring attention to the international community," said Shri Mazhang.
The government of instability has further increased the slums, called Fernando Lima, a media copy, which is the head of an independent media company, many are also concerned about the recent flood of corruption, slow development and abductions.
"People are the people responsible for the country's future to the government and the president, and think he should be one to find solutions to the problems," they say.
Omar Sultanate, an exhibitor, people still need sustainability.
"No one cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the streets," he said.
Children should be taught "as a model for the author of a way of life ",myths and myths.
Thor's stories could have shown "there is no rivalry of all subtle forces in creativity," while the importance of having a dream in the economic era reveals.
To teach many of the myths, it would also be "unsuitable to teach even wild and in some cases it would not be appropriate to teach it in porn and schools," Cross Lee Holland advocated "Cautionary selection" of one of the appropriate acts of age.
"I think it's amazing, in America, myth and folk music are already part of the field of education," he said.
I've been doing this as a plan for twenty years.
He has called writers and teachers "more inspiring" and this "is a new twist" for children, while the messages are being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who has translated the biowolf from Anglo Saxon, along with the writer of the Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk tales, said: "You may have a lot of intentions but out of sight."
Perhaps an adult writer's writing and an adult writer's writing require some meanings of a big difference of hope for an adult.
Everything has to come to a simplified or a pleasant end, because it is a simple sense of good and evil.
And he said that the submission should be submitted, rather than said to be revealed through a story.
The old base is not showing.

Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People can argue that New York City is the birthplace of a stand-up comedy in the United States: nearly a hundred years ago, humorous playwright Frank Fee, who served as the master of the ceremony in the Palace Theatre in Broadway, sat down in the crowd.
Fe's discovery has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
Established and run by Caroline Hersh, founder of the Caroliness Standup Institute, the festival celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, which included more than 60 shows in small clubs and big theaters.
Hirsh says, "Most of them appeared in the Carolines, and became a very big success, to the level at which they became too big to play at the club."
We have created this celebration as a way to continue working with them.
This year's program includes the presence of Vanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual music and comedy benefits for military retired individuals in Madison Square Garden, the "Stand Up for the Heroes", the "Williams and Comedy," the "Stand Up for the Heroes"
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many comedians participating in this year's festival have come from non-traditional media, such as comedy central, F.X. and shows coming on small networks like Spike.
Nick Kroll reached the top spot from Deep-Cable Citycom (F.X.'s illustrious Ronchi Fantasy-Football Theme "Di League"), and now has his own comedy central sketch show.
Jenny Slate is the cast member of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," although she is best known for her viral video series "Marshal Di Shell With Shoes On."
Other young comedians with different sounds, including Cruel and Slate, are Anthony Jessellnik, Despicable, Ethnic-centered Producer W. Commando Bell, American comedians with completely different voices of disappointment.
One of the main attractions of the festival will be, an interview: David Steinbergâ€™s Larry David Speaking:
Steinberg had started working as a stand-up comedian, but he has become a nominee for television and film director, as well as an illegitimate comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted the show "City Down Comedy With David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the centre of Manhattan, in the Town Hall.
"The city is definitely in the D.N.A. comedy of all Larry's actions,"" Steinberg said."
They were telling me that when they were here, sometimes they would go to the gallery between the two buildings and thought to themselves that if I ever lost all my money I would stay here.
Oil continues to fall to <0x24>96 per barrel
An offset report on oil prices, which continues to fall on Friday, is showing concern over increased supply as China's starving power-building sector is growing stronger.
The benchmark for December delivery on the U.S. crude New York Mercentil Exchange was <0x24>96.24 per barrel down to 14 cents in electronic trading in Europe until late in the morning.
The contract has fallen 5.8 per cent for the month of October, falling 39 cents on Thursday.
Adequate supply of crude oil has increased in prices in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the past five weeks, the supply has increased by more than 25 lakh barrels.
But a suggestion from Izafa in the activity of strong demand has revealed that two reports have come on Chinese manufacturing on Friday.
This also shows that developments could continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after lowering 7.8 per cent in the third quarter of a decade to a third quarter.
A benchmark for international crude oil used by U.S. refineries also fell from <0x24>108.58 per barrel on the ICE exchange in London by 26 cents.
The court has blocked action on disruption and sports policy of the New York Police Department
A federal appeals court on Thursday demanded a judge's order for the New York Police Department's disruption and sports program to block the changes and remove the judge from the case.
U.S. Circuit Court Appeal 2 and Judge Shira Shindelar have said that the judge will suspend the outcome of an appeal by the City.
The judge in Nagar had ruled in August on the violation of the Constitution in the manner of preventing people and expulsing them from their interrogation program.
The Police Department of the City also includes the decision to allocate an oversight to its policy and associated training programme to help change, its findings and its therapeutic order have appealed.
The Court of Appeal heard the plea on the trip on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal has said that because he should have made the necessary arrangements for a judge to avoid the presence of a party in a series of media interviews and should have been prosecuted by the American Judges for the prosecution, this misconduct should be altered from the Code of Conduct
The judge heard the verdict that the police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its disruption and sporting program.
He has appointed an external monitor to monitor major changes in policies, training and supervision, including financial reforms, and he has ordered a pilot program for testing body wear cameras in some campuses where he is most closed.
In August, New York City agreed to terminate the practice of storing names and addresses of those whose cases were dismissed after a police arrest.
An oral argument on the appeal of the city is scheduled for some time after 14 March 2014.
Disruption and sporting exercises have been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The break and sports policy has been in some form for decades, but most black and Hispanic men, have dramatically increased under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to raise all the time in 2011 to 684330.
A suit was filed by four men by all minorities in 2004 and became a case of a class action.
The supporters of the change in the NYPD break and sports program have said that the end of improper behavior will have to be a more reliable and effective police force and may affect the use of the policies of other police departments.
Opponents say the change will reduce the morale of the police, but crime, money wasted and not solve a widespread problem of a police force under pressure from thousands of officials over the past decade.
The judge has noted that the break and termination had not been set for the athlete, which is constitutional, but had improved the implementation of the NYPD stop.
The training included a large number of participants from Godda, Pakud, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribag and Chatara districts.
During the seven-day period, all participants were informed of several universities including tent pitching, flag pole.
The training is being carried out in cooperation with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
All the participants are expressing a sense of unity by engaging in prayer.
Camp Principal Vipin Kumar State Training Commissioner is providing special assistance.
Colson used phone hacking to verify the secret information.
The former editor of News of the World, Andy Coleson, has been accused of being the home secretary of Charles Clarke while he was in charge of a so-called "secretary of secret information" in an attempt to "confirm" his famed relationships.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis QC told Old Bali that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was meeting her "attractive special advisor" Hannah Polby.
The court said the newspaper had appointed private investigator Glenn Mulcair to hack Polby's voicemail and "watch" the man, but Colson also called and left his voicemail.
Mr. Addis said, "The prosecution suggests that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of N.O.T.W., is not supposed to be standing outside of people's homes, but rather keeping an eye on them."
He said that N.O.T.W. used three methods to investigate cases: phone hacking, monitoring, and face-to-face.
The third one included the editors themselves.
Of course he knew the other way, namely Nigarni, he certainly knew.
What about the first one?
Did you know about the phone hacking?
He says, no, we say, "Yeah, he knew."
The rumors about Clark's prolific relationships were first presented by the AOTW's feature desk at the time, when a sexually avid source in Mrs. Polby said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
From home from Mulcair in August 2006, at least three voicemail tapes were seized from Mrs. Polby's phone.
The investigators also found the computer of the private investigator on which Mrs. Polby and her sister were named as "Project".
During the period during which he was being investigated, Mrs. Polby's grandparents were asked for information by telephone anonymously.
During this time, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Wederap watched Mrs. Polby's coming-and-go surveillance.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told him via a voicemail: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow, which I'd definitely like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Addis said that Colson's involvement in the case is in the same battalion with other important individuals, such as former Home Secretary David Blanket.
The court heard on Thursday that Colson had talked to Mr. Blankett about the relationship between a married woman and her husband, while he was looking at the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks who were married at the time.
Colson and Brooks refused to interfere with other people for hacking phones between October 3 and August 9, 2006.
Mulkier, Thurlbeck and Wederap have accepted phone hacking.
Promote corporate fears by revealing the NSA on state surveillance.
In August, late on a quiet day, a German police helicopter landed at the U.S. Embassy in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
Under the direction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the mission of the German Home Intelligence Agency was to take a picture of the roof of the U.S. Quarter, which is less than 5 km away from the European Central Bank and Foundation Bank.
The German media asked BfV to express hope to identify the presence of Lissing Antenna and indicated an exchange action between the U.S. and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, stressed that the U.S. has "stealed foreign companies' trade secrets of its foreign intelligence capabilities and has not repressed U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness."
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has made a whistleblower, began revealing the treasure of his secret to U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure if the director will not keep his word.
The U.S. National Security Agency has spying on Brazil's oil company Petrobras, and our cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have expressed concern about the government's surveillance.
The last thing came when it became known that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly a decade ago.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then certainly the leaders of the trading world are also potential targets.
Snowden has made the deep cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible for these data to be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany should wake up," said Oliver GrÃ¼n, president of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by the German firms' council, the U.S. has almost now become a major risk, such as China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
In all the documents leaked by Mr. Snowden, however, there is so far no evidence that the United States has gone to the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the lack of internet capabilities of the European Union. And it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
The leaders of the business world are skeptical of this.
"Someone in the German Parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"This is not a way," said Huso Platoner, chairman of German commercial software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, then he shouldnâ€™t have let it die 20 years ago.
In Germany, everything is discounted. From coal, to cars, to farmers.
The IT industry is everything.
The revelations made by Snowden about U.S. technical sophistication and espionage access have proven to be a disaster for some companies that were previously believed to be China's biggest surveillance threat.
A major shift is taking place in the cloud computing area where European officials are more aware that the data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore have become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey released by a business organization Cloud Security Alliance, some 10 per cent of non-US members planned to use an U.S.-based cloud provider after disclosing data about the Prism Mining program.
Jim Snabee, chief executive officer with SAP, said: "We saw a new question that customers didn't come up a year ago â€“ that is â€“ my data said is stored? And can you guarantee that it will stay in that jurisdiction physically?"
Many German officials argue that the latest report is just confirming what they already knew: that the powerful state wants to steal their most invaluable secrets and data, and for this reason it should be outlined at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is an economic spy.
It has always been there.
"This has been a subject for many years, and through fundamental current discussion, nothing has changed," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
The U.S. spies on us at the commercial and industrial level and we do so, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
Corporate leaders are generally unwilling about the defense system and it is an advantage to the attacker.
For large companies, messaging records have been going on for a long time, whether leaving a home in business is misunderstood by taking a USB stick, or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is misunderstood to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of car manufacturers Audi, says,which is a century old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings because their use could not be as remote hearing devices
Germany's BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile when smart phones are compromised due to risk on foreign tours.
Prepaid mobile phones were later discarded.
However, it is a matter of concern that small and medium-sized companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, it has a number of companies in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often warn against lack of experience, staff and unauthorized access to financial resources in an effective way to protect corporate secrecy," BfV warns in a report.
The United States has warned of the economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence named in February, according to the French Washington Post, behind Russia and China, for the economic notification, to a second layer of the criminals involved in hacking.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company when it comes to economic espionage, "France is the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview: "The services know well that all countries, even if they go along in a non-terrorist battle, are spying on their colleagues."
The U.S. spies on us at the commercial and industrial level and we do so, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
No one was fooled.
The parents of a Georgian teenager who was killed in a 'unique accident' believe that his son was murdered
A Georgian teenager whose body was found wrapped in a restaurant mat in his high school gym believes that his son was murdered, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, G.A., was found trapped in a mat directly standing behind the bleachers in his high school gym on January 11.
London County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson had died in a 'unique accident', but the 17-year-old's family denied it.
Benjamin Crump, a lawyer presenting to Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News Dot Com that "they fully believe that their son has been murdered."
Sheriff has no confidence in the way she was told to die.
"They believe that this is beyond the logic of physical rule and general wisdom,"" Krupp said."
They believe that this conclusion is an excuse for the safety of the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
"He sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned in a body bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Maulre said on Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, considering that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Is his murder due to a crime?
Mure said the matter at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, they will take us wherever they go.
My goal is to bring the truth forward.
"I think there is a reason for the environment for a formal investigation,"" he said."
Moore told reporters that the ARM test finds signs that Johnson's death was the result of "situated breathing resistance."
"According to Murray, a different cause of death was discovered in a second body test."
"There are so many questions that should be answered or confirmed,"" he said."
Moore also said that if he finds sufficient evidence to prosecute a criminal in the case of Johnson's death or to investigate civil rights, he would ask the FBI to do so.
The representative was not immediately available for comment from the office of the Landez County Sheriff when contacted on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the judge of South Georgia ordered officials, investigators, to release all surveillance videos reviewed by the investigators.
The boy's parents say he hopes that the video footage will find some indications of how his death occurred.
The CDC has issued guidelines on allergies to children for schools.
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines for controlling food allergies in children at the school.
Such guidelines have been issued by the U.S. government for the first time, as the number of children who go to school is increasing with food allergy.
Now, one in every 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
CDC found that between 1997 and 2007 there was an 18 per cent increase in food allergy cases among children.
This guideline informs schools how to inform teachers and employees about the food allergy of children, and how to handle it in the event of any allergic reactions.
Schools have also been advised to keep stock of apenephrine to cope with potentially known acute inflammatory disease (anaphylaxis) - which is the auto-injector of the appen brand most commonly used.
The State Assembly has recently updated the rules, making it easy for schools to keep stocks of apenephrine in larger quantities.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from allergic reactions.
Kids can say, "Something seems to be bumping into my tongue," "It feels like there's hair on my tongue," or "It's getting messy in my tongue."
Intersex Kidsâ€™ Parents May Choose Their Childrenâ€™s â€˜Ling Undefinedâ€™
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to grant recognition to the third gender for children born with vague genital mutilation.
Newborns will no longer be designated as men or women in a sustained manner.
Under the new law, parents are not required to declare gender for such children, the law allows them to declare gender â€˜unspecifiedâ€™ or â€˜unspecifiedâ€™ on the childâ€™s birth certificate.
The aim of the new law is to reduce the pressure on parents who can make gender-specification decisions related to psychiatry for newborns in a hurry, and to fight against discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex person said years later, "Not so I'm a man, not a woman."
I'm going to keep the wounded, stingy bandwidth made by doctors.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children a year is a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions, which comes under the examination of disorders of sexual development, it is a collective term that is abnormal in the uterus, genitalia (angina or ulceration), or abnormally used.
It may be that Walis Simpson was having intercourse.
Gender identification is not yet properly understood, but most experts in the U.S. believe that it is better to use the best available information to specify gender when gender-determination may not be possible. Prevention of prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment, if not
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Dresser, who is an expert on gender-identity issues, said that Germany's new law "seems like a good thing."
Intersex children create moral inequalities.
"Some people are in a situation like a life-crisis that requires saliva therapy, but it doesn't happen with most children,"" he said."
You can only specify the gender without saliva-therapy, and then see how the identification develops.
What kind of sex will develop in a child, the science of this is not very accurate.
No one can give a reasonable answer to why this is happening.
It's a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
The report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as being different from transsexuals or transgender people, since their status is not related either to gender or to gender, but rather to their biological composition.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual impulses, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breasts and length; in primary sexual impulses such as genital organs and genital organs; or in genital organs.
The report provides a synopsis of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of employment, as well as of harassment, violence and biased crimes.
There are now special camps for non-conforming sex boys.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adult individuals to label men, women, or "third-party gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie Me-Walby became the world's first recognized "languageless" person after winning the legal appeal to maintain "unspecified" gender status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passport will also have a third specification as X for intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to a news report on France 24, gender issues in the neighbouring country in France are still controversial.
In the year 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country have signed the petition to go back to the school's "lang theory" from the books.
The U.S. Catholic Online website has also objected to this German law, saying, "when the world is going in a state where gender is the choice itself, but is not going into sexual activity," we are two more pillars of civilization.
The mother of the newborn in Maryland also told the baby zone that she would like to see the children specified gender at the time of birth.
He said on the website about the upbringing, "The upbringing is very stressful without additional limits, especially if you don't even know what your baby's gender is."
Kids need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genital warriors were called Hermaphrodites (Ubhilangi), who were named after the beautiful Greek deity who were Bilinguals.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered sex as a slate that could be erased and then written.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of psychiatry, they are understanding that gender recognition is a complicated task, and sometimes there may be mistakes from therapists, who will not know what to do about their gender specification when children grow up.
"In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Dresher says.
When these babies were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called the psychiatrist.
The existing theory on the treatment of children with vague genital mutilation was presented by Dr. John Money of John Hapkins University, who considered sex to be constructive.
He argued the composition of the word "language recognition" and how social and environmental signs - how parents raise the child - determine by interfering with the child's genes and hormones whether to identify him as a man or a woman.
But in a case of the year 1966, known as "John/Joan", his theory became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose sex was accidentally sexed during the lingagrarchram-ukhedan (working session) to remove her ankles by fully binding the child and to act like her lazy girl.
"Many presented the case as a successful case of the status quo, but it didn't happen," Dresher said.
At the age of 15, the child turned himself back into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresher said that some doctors are still "following that pattern."
But with the advent of the Internet in the aftermath of the 1990s, these individuals who underwent gender psychiatry began to face up to "not happy with the consequences."
The same was the case with 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce of Montana, who was born with X.Y. male fertility, but her gender was unclear.
Doctors did not clearly understand that her gender was small, or her boss was large, but they were sure that she could never live a "satisfied life" as a man.
So in the year 1976, some time after her birth, the outer organs of Bruce and the anus were excreted and she looked like a virgin girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn't happy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At the age of 18, she was about to have a vajinoplasty with him.
But feeling depressed and some discomfort, he demanded medical records.
This led him to find out the terrible truth.
At the time of birth, I was bound - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from producing sufficient amounts of testosterone, causing his genitals to fail to develop properly.
After discovering the truth, he returned to be a man, took a testosterone supplement, and removed his breasts.
She was disfellowshipped due to medical treatment.
Today, she explains to people about intersex individuals in an organization called the Interface Project to make their perceptions normal.
But, California-based Legal Group Advocates for Infomed Choices Executive Director Annie Tamer-Mattis expresses concern that Germany's law "invites chipping and clamping."
They say, "Most activists think that the law of Germany will inspire parents to make quick decisions and to designate the child as "indefinite."
We are afraid that this will encourage the intervention.
We think that instead of waiting, it is better to specify the gender of a man or woman.
But we don't know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamer-Matis said his organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be identified in the third gender," according to the report.
"""Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal sex,"" he said."
The law of Germany relates to specifying it at the time of birth.
It is not a ravage that is currently being fought by newborns.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their body.
But Pittsburgh breast radiologist Dr. Erlen Baratz, whose daughter has a sexual developmental disorder, and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that Germany's law allows both parents and children to "behave."
Baratji's daughter, Kate, was born with male chromosomes, but she was a DSD called full androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Since her androgen was flawed in graha, female excitement developed in the cat.
It has a vagina in its body, but not the uterus or dental.
Katy, 29, is now married and is a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is pregnant, she expects to adopt or become a mother through hospital surrogacy.
"This law allows parents to make sure that they don't make any decisions for themselves in a hurry,"" Baratz said."
It provides them with time and understanding in a proper way by some test before writing 'male' or 'female'.
In this way, you're fine - raise the child, love the child.
You have a beautiful baby and have fun with it.
We don't need to do a surgical procedure in a hurry that can't be restored.
"It brings children into the decision-making process and frees parents from the enmity that implies that they don't believe they're okay,"" he said."
Finally, the child will determine which gender he is more comfortable with - and that will be a very good thing.
This enables children to make their own decisions for themselves.
A legal awareness camp was held on behalf of the Tahsil Legislative Services Committee of Ramanagar under the chairmanship of the committee and all the judges of Ramanagar, Sandeep Kaur.
In which information was given to students and others on the right to education and the law for economically disadvantaged people.
Advocate ML Gupta, Rohin Bhardwaj, and Sarpanch made the people aware of the matter in the camp.
A large number of villagers were present in the program.
Report: Consideration of the Biden Dumping Obama Campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers of President Barack Obama have silently considered Hillary Clinton's ticket for 2012 in Biden's place because of the post of Vice President.
The most notable explosion in the mystery is the 2012 campaign tom, "Double Down: Change the game 2012," highly anticipated by Mark Halperin and John Heleman.
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and on Thursday evening told the president's top advisers to organize "extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011" to find out what the drop in Obama's election hope could help dumping biden
According to the Times National Political Reporter Jonathan Martin, the book reveals the full details of the efforts of the Chief Officers' campaign and puts the bill on the former White House Post to change the name of the White House, which is the main bill of the former White House Post Office staff, to find out.
The potential switch was a very secure secret within the infrastructure of the Chicago Campaign and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the presidentâ€™s close advisers â€“ including Dell, former Obama campaign chief Jim Masina, and former White House senior advisers David Axlrod and David Palloufe â€“ have changed.
The "Double Down" claims that Dale attempted to change Biden despite his personal skepticism before finally making a decision when his information was telling that Clinton's label would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"I looked at the whole scene and said, and one of them, it was," Dell told the newspaper.
You remember, when the president was in danger at the time, we were in a situation like this, "Holy Christ, what else shall we do?"
While Dale described the research as "cautionary," Martin had told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding how much this claim would benefit from being Pole.
"The campaign doesn't spend on voting and focused groups like money until they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was looking for change.
Martin told the CNN that he had asked him if his boss knew about the possible change in the field.
While Dale said he "doesn't seem to know the president about the possible change," former chief of staff thought it was "possible" that he knew Obama.
"Double down" sure: Will not the political inquiry reach Obama's desk?" Martin said.
Cooper asked Martin if he didn't know about Obama's biden dumping ticket research that he seriously thought.
"Maybe," Martin said.
Do you like glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glo-in-the-dark ice cream - jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken the plethora of marine animals in order to develop the best breakfast.
He came to this idea after reading a research letter on the jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists made use of chemical gloss on the re-glossing of the protein.
Ice cream will increase the pH level of protein by reacting with the tongue and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says that the ice cream is illuminated by reacting with the heat of the mouth, i.e. the more you win, the more it will be illuminated.
Charlie, founder of IM Delicias Ice Cream Company, said: "It's unbelievable, but the production of the early days will get me about <0xC2><0xA3>200 from 2 grams of luggage."
The protein we use in the ice cream will react with the neutral pH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth warms, the protein will increase the pH level and the ice cream will glow.
We've been exercising for the past few months and it feels perfectly right to share it on Halloween because it gives an amazing bright effect.
This will probably be the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the gloss of the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So the cost of each scoop brings me around 140 pounds.
The taste of Iska is very good.
Charlie's Bristol-based experimental company is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf apne.
But his next composition has proved to be even more ambitious.
"""I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream,"" he said."
It's naturally impossible because of the ice crystals that make up the glaciers, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice Cream is the utility of the anti-inflammatory properties of a jellyfish, which has been synthesized by Chinese scientists.
The entire market was closed to the customers in the Queen's Garden market.
Recently, people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy the dishes.
This was recently in the central market of Wajirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar, and Prashant Vihar.
Some of the same were also seen in the surf shops of Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Model Town.
Here, too, people bought gold and silver intensities and coins.
That is why other markets, including the outer ring road, have also been jammed.
However, people who left the office for home had to spend hours in jail to get home.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was young, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay silent late and play dress up for the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I've become more of a lobbyist.
I haven't signed up to give out candy from my apartment for the last two years, and maybe not this year.
But the data indicates that there is a black sheep when it comes to halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating <0x24>158 million Halloween this time., <0x24>6.9 billion will be spent on clothing and decoration.
One of the things I've always wanted to do is to keep up with the trends of Halloween.
The total cost of the dress is estimated at <0x24>6.9 billion, according to the NRF, at <0x24>1.2 billion.
This year, everyone is angry with the inanimate objects.
Women don't have to have sex, because they also have sexy foods such as pizzas, hamburgers, and gazebos.
A lot of zombies in hopes for Murdo, and thanks to moving Murdo's space movement will make our Instagram feeds for men this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after dresses will be zombies, batmans, robbers and witches.
I don't think there's anything wrong with traditionalism.
Last year we wore a dog dress and we weren't alone by surprise.
According to the NRF, Americans will actually spend <0x24>330 million on pet clothing.
That's why there are a lot of hotdogs with dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't look around.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend <0x24>1.9 billion this year.
Hairy bars, lollipops, milk dudes, twitters and Clark bars are around <0xC2><0xA3>600 million.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, it is good news that 41 million tricks have taken part in our neighborhood.
But in fact, we, and those who are having fun, will buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
According to the Confectioners Association, one thing we won't use during Halloween candycorn, but it will also cost about 35 million pounds.
That's about 9 billion of Macca's personal wealth.
This is a mystery. So far to solve
There is nothing more elemental than the halloween ghost house.
They are the best names, "The terror behind the wall (which, in fact, is a prison), "Chikh-o-chikh" and were like "House of Shock."
In fact, according to the U.S. government, it's an officially approved 1200 ghost home in the U.S. that generates 500 million revenues. And it's a terrific good photo that puts your friend on Facebook and that guy who looks like you.
Finally, letâ€™s talk about cows.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a jack-o-latin carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - that's something we've done since we were little.
For us, the "baby in a pumpkin trend" was the flaw of the penthouse that just started last year, so most of us are digging out these gardens and not living with them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau this year, the U.S. will spend around <0x24>106 million on pumpkin.

The dream of the stranded merchants to do business in the Patakha market located in the Transport Area was not fulfilled.
Patakha merchants have been trapped in Mazdar after an order by the High Court.
Neither can they now trade in the temporary patchcha market created in Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licenses for business in the Transport Area.
The commission, formed by the Punjab and Haryana High Courts, declared the temporary Patakha Market on Ranjit Avenue unsafe during its visit.
Amritsar's deputy commissioner was also fined Rs 10 lakh due to lack of proper management.
The High Court, in its order, has summoned Amritsar's administrative officials, saying what kind of administration could not solve even a difficult one of the merchants for nine years.
They couldn't find a place in the city.
Subsequently, the merchants were asked to issue licences for business only in the market located in Najagarh.
Even after the order, the merchants were happy, but on their happiness, the police poured water on Friday.
The team of the police licensed branch arrived at the Pattaya market and sold the farm there by putting a counter on it.
After that, it was impossible to meet the conditions that were stated to them in one day.

Firefighting team called to rescue a lost pope on the mouth of a catastrophic mountain 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cocker Spaniel Ruby fled after arriving in a small road crash
Three days later, he was seen trapped in a mine by a dog walker.
Firefighters dropped the front part of the rock under the rope to save the dog from the mouth of death
After being trapped on the mouth of a catastrophic mountain 50 feet above the ground by the Pope, he was lucky to have been called to the firefighters.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby had fled after arriving in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
His owner Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Bakey Hall, 20, Denham, Ruby were in a flappit mine in West Yorkshire to meet up again, and he gave the West Yorkshire Fire and Defence Service.
After a small accident, he had searched as crazy for his lost dog, and posted an appeal on social networking sites.
On Wednesday at 2.15 p.m., a quick-looking Dock Walker saw Ruby on the mountain in the mine at a height of 50 feet from the ground.
A technical rescue team arrived at the scene from the Collequin fire station and dug down the rope to save Ruby and used a belly tube to bring him down from the rock.
"Technical rescue officer Andy Clayton said: """He was in a critical situation."
He was in the middle of the front of the rock, up and down 50 feet.
He did not act a single act during the defense, he remained a stone.
But now he's good.
After that, she ate the biscuits.
It was a very unusual call for help.
It's unbelievable to see a dog.
Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said: "Ruby has survived in a fortunate manner."
He was likely to be severely injured or even in a worse condition.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where he was found well in addition to fatigue and dehydration.
Mrs Hall, from West Yorkshire, said: "It was terrifying to see the defense work."
At first, I couldnâ€™t believe how he got there.
It's amazing to get him back in his hands.
The veterinarian said that if he gets too tired and falls, he will definitely fall down.
The firefighters have done a great job.
What he has done is really a brave work.
We're happy with them, and they were all the best.
Mr. Elderson also told Keegle, "We were afraid that he might fall, but he stayed there."
The firefighters did a great job.
I can't believe how he got there.
Mick Jagger says when Katy Perry was 18, she didn't hit her
During an interview with this week's Australian radio show, Pon Starr said that he sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Day Hard."
Perry said that he had dinner with senior rocker, and when I was 18, he hit me.
"It's getting old, and she's treating me well,"" he said."
A 70-year-old Jagger representative said in a statement on Thursday that he "clearly refuses to ever strike on Katy Parry."
The representative also said: "Perhaps Pari is talking about them in another person's misunderstanding."
Pari was one of the guest singers on Rolling Stone's tour this year.
His new album "Prizm" reached the top spot this week.
George Kerewan: The European Union's disintegration gives Scotts an option
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that free Scotland will be required to join as a free travel area throughout Europe as a condition of membership of the EU.
Passport control on Barwick and the contels on the walls of Hadrian indicate the boundary of the wire.
It is true that the Strathclyde Paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although - predictably - it was not described in the headlines.
No one has described that E.U. members spend most of their time changing their formal rules according to their requirements.
Since Scotland is no longer the Schengen region, Brussels will be a cheap discount for Brussels in return for getting what it really wants from Scotland, in return for continuing non-compliance.
So, then, a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a
And the thing that has been trapped for so long has been accumulated. First of all, I heard the basic news about "freedom means passport control" about 40 years ago.
However, this interesting old story has lost an interesting point in rehearsing it.
Why should we expect to be bidding to Europe from independent Scotland anyway?
Why buy-and-sell for London's yokes, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great post-war plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the euro crisis, the project has officially died in Europe.
Dedicated teams across the EU are gaining strength to oppose the EU or close the euro as the same currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany Party - which was founded this year alone - suddenly came to the federal elections in September and received nearly fifty lakh votes, and thus the Liberal Democrats (our own Liberal Liberal Party).
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has proved to be a fundamental change.
As well as the strict rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people have had to think that the project has gone too far, due to the obstacles imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency.
The euro crisis did not play much role in the excessive budget deficits of national governments - that was true only in the case of Greece.
Instead, the euro system stabilized its members' currency exchange rates in favour of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency depreciation, southern Europe finds itself in a state of inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only way is to reduce wages and public spending - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
The current budget and currency problems are in the midst of a deep European productivity patient.
To provide discounts on consumer spending to French and German energy firms - as a result of the "reduced" energy policies imposed by Brussels, the European industry is twice as expensive for electricity and for gas as compared to the United Nations.
This is the cost-effective loss that we have already seen at Grandmamuth.
Even if all wages in the world are frozen, the European petrochemicals industry cannot be saved from being affected by cheap U.S. shell gas.
As a result, the feeling of rebellion in the people was inflaming, especially in France, which was once a major fan of the E.U.
After the war, France's top politicians saw the U.U. as a means to keep control of Germany, and Paris as a means of providing equal billing to Vancouver in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has applied its own economic policies to Europe, causing Franceâ€™s economy to collapse.
Result: The anti-National Front of Mary Le Pen's South Panther, E.U., has won by pushing the ruling Socialist to third place in the recent sub-election.
At the moment, the front in France is the most popular party with 24 percent of the vote - it's a timely warning to the British Labour that they can't walk on the standard that dissolution for the left will benefit the right itself.
What is Le Pen doing with his new acclaim among French blondes, working class?
The party wants to use the next year's EU elections to form an anti-EU anti-monetary group in the European Parliament.
If, as much as possible, the anti-EU party performs well in these elections, then this type of group could affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My point of view is this: soon in Europe, the union of anti-EU and anti-euro sentiment will end the euro.
The euro will not end completely, but it will come back in a form like the "(sovereign) Europe of the nations" which will be supported by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its fertile economies may maintain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I expect the U.K. itself to stay away from this project in hopes of increasing proximity with the U.S.
However, the growing interest of Vancouver in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the Cold Atlantic.
What's going to happen to Scotland?
We can choose to remain the region of Little England (necessarily).
Or we can protect our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels to be separated at the right time.
I think that Scotland can perform better in the smooth European order, provided that we keep our own currencies.
It will be easier to work together with other countries of the same mind in Europe by non-EU nations.
Otherwise, we should consider preserving our economic freedom by walking the way of Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland has been the most successful anti-competitive political campaign in Europe - notably - which has been proposed by Laber's Chancellor Alistair Darling on the basis of the 2011 (and implemented) budget cuts.
Voting for independence for Scotland at this time would be absurd, as in that situation it would have to accept the rules of mitigation imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Pre-Time: Getting Older
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls are getting younger in age than those of their own age, according to the study.
Physical change does not mean that youth is near
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals may be defective.
Experts believe that a swelling outbreak can be one of the causes of adolescence at a young age
Premature adolescence is not as effective in boys.
Former CNN reporter Pat Ethereum is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter starts developing breasts and developing genitalia at the age of 7 or 8?
This week, at the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, Pediatric Endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplowitz has clarified that these are the initial ideals for physical changes, this is not common among American girls.
Caplowitz says, "I spend a lot of time trusting parents - that generally does not reflect rapid progress towards a full-fledged adolescence."
Direct symptoms of development such as breast constipation, genitalia and nail hair, and physical odor are seen prematurely in girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very slight change in the age of the enlightenment (first month-religion).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years to develop first," explains Caplovitz, who are also the authors of "time-to-earth adolescence in girls: a guide to addressing this common problem."
The most accurate test of youth development is the time.
What is the beginning of adolescence, there is debate about it, but when breast development increases before the age of 8 years, two call it "baby-adult."
In most cases, this process will be slowed down or stopped - which can be closely monitored by the pediatrician.
In the case of more rapid progress, an endocrinologist may be required to examine the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or systs.
There are treatments to slow down premature menstrual periods and other consequences: premature ageing of asthma, which can result in unpredictable growth and decreases as adults.
The structures for drug or hormone treatment depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth, and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovix is savvy about drugs but admits, "Pressing youth can increase behavioral issues, and girls may seem to feel separate from their peers."
The second big problem can be understood: Parents just donâ€™t want their underage daughter to have a monthly religion.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain hygiene," Caplowitz said.
A woman, whose daughter had started menstrual dysfunction at the age of 10, recalls, "It was a stroke."
Although there were symptoms of this and we also talked about monthly religion, he was not emotionally prepared.
She was afraid of her school and returned anxious that she had begun her first menstrual period in her attendance.
There are many prevailing theories about the causes of untimely youth.
However, there is no continuous evidence that hormones, chemicals, or sexually transmitted messages in milk or other foodstuffs can be accused in the environment.
Boys - just like girls - are getting old-fashioned youth.
Caplovity rules that the main cause of this is the outbreak of swelling.
She helped conduct a study on 6 to 9-year-old girls in the year 2001, which combines body fat with adolescence.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it as well.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to have teenage births before their age.
There is a lot of explanation for this.
Globally, the image of time-to-earth youth, from economic conditions to weather and jeans, seems to be affected by all things.
Other puzzles: Although the boys' faces and genitals are getting hair at a young age, the course of the adolescence in them is not as clear as the girls.
Other doctors present at the A.A.P. conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see hair of mucosa and genital mutilation.
Dr. Laurence Silverman, a pediatrician endocrinologist at Goreyeb Childrens Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey, says, "We need to be careful about it." As the real beginning of adolescence
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their pediatrician to get an opinion on how to talk to your children.
Caplowitz advised, "This could mean to talk before the expected time."
If you are calm, your child will usually respond correctly.
Prematurely developing girls need to be assured that even if it is prematurely occurring, it is part of normal life.
The temperature was down by 3.1 degrees Celsius on Friday.
The rain and cold weather on Wednesday night made the people feel very cold.
In the meantime, the people went to the markets and to their destinations.
During the first winter rains, people have also removed Rajai.
In the morning, people were also enjoying the sun.
As the weather changes, there will be a lot of relief from the disease, etc., but after that, the sunshine continued to be cloudy throughout the day.
The children also came to school wearing a sweater.
According to the Air Force Meteorological Department, the maximum temperature on Wednesday was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7 degrees Celsius.
It was raining at 7.8 millimeters.
According to the weather department, clouds will remain in the sky.
Controversy over large orders of jet manufacturers for seat width.
A hurdle has been set up for the fight for this month's Dubai Arsho among the leading aircraft manufacturers for the breadth of tourist-class seats for long-haul flights
The controversy focuses on the breadth of the economic class seat in the aircraft of long flights, not as always given by airlines but whose assigned location efficiency is Latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing company has the key.
The Aruba Economic Cabin is expected to have at least 18-inch (46 cm) wide seat this week, but it should be decided by the airlines, according to its head-to-head rival Boeing.
The controversy between the aircraft manufacturers comes when a large version of the twin engine of the long-distance arcaft was sold out of the possible order recorded after the incident of 17-21.
How is the previous section of the aircraft made--especially whether the seating 9 or 10 is equal to more capacity claims are being designed to mini-jumbo jets being prepared?
Boeing says it has created the "777 X" that will put 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 logos in a row.
Airbus said it would take 350 people to a seat equal to 9, leaving 18 inches behind, while staying with the A350.
Aircraft carriers often engage in trade on technical issues through advertising in the commercial press.
Now, the Airbus 777 X is expected to dominate over 100 orders at the Dubai Air Show, which is further appealing to the public.
Recently it is being seen that the beginning of the War of Vigilance is something that is showing this to Finnsero, will you accept it at a restaurant with three at a time?
"Airbus sales chief John Leigh is also offering long-haul flights to cancer sites from the Boeing Regional Turbo," he said.
As a change, people are getting bigger, but the way the plane is sitting hasn't changed.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Health, between the 1970s when the Boeing 747 was defined as a modern long-term ki travel tha, and between the ages of 40-49, the average American male to me weight increased by 10 percent.
According to U.S. health statistics, the average U.S. man's waist is 39.7 inches in the 21st century.
Airbus says that its rivals have adhered to a seat concept of 1950 when the new name "Jet set" was the average periphery of the machine.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission that suggests an additional inch of 53 per cent improvement in the width of the seat.
Boeing disputed the statistics on the seat measurements of the airbus, saying it does not depend on the decision of the manufacturers on how the airlines make the balance between rental and facilities.
It is also said, that research shows that the width of a seat depends on the experience of more than one cabin.
Boeing Cabin Expert Kent Crawer said, "It really tells the airline in providing flexibility and on the things they believe they need to do in order to succeed."
"They don't want to tell us what their advantages are."
He knows his business better than anyone else's.
For flyers it's about the elbow room, but for suppliers it's a quick issue that can affect income.
The trade of at least <0x24>700 billion behind this controversy is estimated to be sufficient in the coming decades to tip the scales of the competition of the aircraft order to American and European exports.
Reuters reported in July that for the first time, whether the seat layout is really a battle issue between the new jets.
Airbus and Boeing claimed to have 20 per cent workload per seat in their new twin engine design, the leader of that segment, compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300R.
The performance claim of the Boeing depends on the 10-inch 777 x 9-inch original 777 design.
The unit cost has now been compared to 10 equal to the profit.
Kevin Keniston, head of Europe's Airbus passenger facility, said "Bing's plan is to occupy more seats to make their aircraft more competitive with our products."
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-row cabin suggests for the existing 777 S that many passengers are on the side of the denser layout, which can go along with cheap rent.
Cabin interior expert My Carby, founder and editor's runway girl network said "the eighteen-inch seat width will be great for passengers, but the reality is that this airbus is under threat by the threat of the 777."
Airbus and Boeing seats are not supplied but a list of suppliers to choose from is provided for the airline.
Jet vendors from all over the world also take precautions to check out these layouts.
While relaxing, all builders are also providing low-cost jet aircraft services and high-density layouts for regional travel.
Airbus is giving a 10-equivalent A350 but says it hasn't been sold yet.
But until recently, the Airbus has emphasized extensive cabin seats on some of its jet planes for the need for more cabin facilities.
It is unlikely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers of modern jet aircraft, but it could distract from the wave of sales of the 777X.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine May End the Pleasure of Smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can end the fun encountered by smoking.
The same dosage of the vaccine was able to keep the rats safe from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
The test on humans requires further and testing, which may take several years, but Ronald Crystal, a professor at the Upper Cornell Medical College in New York, said the aneurysms are positive.
Professor Cornell said, "We very much hope that the strategy of this type of vaccine can ultimately help millions of smokers, who have used all the methods available on the market today, but who have tried to quit smoking by using more of these methods."
The new vaccine has a harmless virus, which has been prepared to deliver genetic information with the aim of creating anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus, selectively infects the liver cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, and by deactivating them before they reach the brain, they prevent nicotine from swelling within the smoker.
In the test, the vaccines given to the mice that were later given nicotine were performing their normal activity.
The researchers say that but the rat that was not given the vaccine "feels good", it was a sign that nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in the journal Sciences Transnational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to be dosed on a regular basis, in order to maintain the level of antibodies, but it proved expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be high, as the liver cell will become an antibody factory.
Prof. Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children, before the urge to try cigarettes, which would save them from nicotine addiction.
But it is likely to be used by people who smoke tobacco to quit smoking.
"They will find out that if they start smoking again, they won't get any pleasure from smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help them get rid of their habit," he said.
British scientists found the finding interesting, but warned that much more research was needed to be done.
Even after the post-mortem, the curtain could not rise due to the real cause of the death of the tiger.
The Forest Department is responding extensively to the death of the first-visited tiger.
On Thursday night, the forest staff of the Ramnagar Forest Department had found the body of a tiger near the Pawalgarh Knighti Nile Reserve.
There were no signs of injury or injury on the body, as well as all organs of the tiger's body being safe.
Vibek Pandey, Deputy Director of CTR, Saket Badola, DFO Kakasha Nasim, SDO GS Karki in the presence of CTR's veterinarian Bharat and Kotabag veterinarian Hema Rashwar
According to sources, during the post-mortem, the terrorist body of the gang is reported to be deteriorating.
This did not reveal the real cause of the tiger's death.
On the death of the Tiger, the police officers responded to the attack.
However, IVRI Barely has been sent to the internal organs of the tiger for confirmation of poisoning.
West Circle Forest Guard Vivek Pandey said that the death of the tiger can only be called natural.
There were no signs of poisoning from the body of the tiger, etc.
However, the Bisara investigation is being sent for confirmation of the poison as well as the surrounding area is being investigated for it.
We refuse to be influenced by the Tripod Obi-Wan.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joa Tripod will be investigated by State Karpson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joa Tripody has denied the denial of the policy at the request of his political guru ed Obaid, the former conservative of New South Wales ed Obaid, whose government-controllers
The Independent Commission on Anti-Corruption (ICAC) on Friday detailed the investigation that,whether Mr. Obaid has violated the policies of several state ministers for violating the waistbands of the perpetrator? Where the two restaurants and cafes owned by Obaid were later in 2005, without the ribs
Following the evidence provided on Thursday by Lin Ashpole, former Deputy Chief of Staff, this was aware of the hidden self-esteem of Mr. Tripody Mr. Obaid's allegations.
During the years of talks in 2005, the government pressed for the launch of public tenders for belts.
The bandits were against it and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the Circular Enterprise for the Belts, which earned Obi-Wan <0x24>2.5 crore a year, was renounced from the Tender of the Belts.
Shri Tripody, who was the Minister of Gates from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of the Public Tender.
But he refused to change at the request of Shri Obaid , Shri Tripody had called for a change in the government belt policy
Imprint presented in a telephone call at ICAC in August and September 2007 by Mr. Obaid and Mr. Tripody and Mr. Steve Dunn, a senior official who had come to Mr. Obaid's Department of Health after working at the Ministry of Ports
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi. "Was the development of the commercial belt policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the case?"
"No," said Mr. Tripod.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obi-Wan.
According to officials, Israeli fighter jets were flown in Syria.
Israeli fighter jets targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administrative officer confirmed by Fox News.
The officer did not say what the purpose was, but there was at least one purpose needed.
According to the Associated Press, the Russian Target was a SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel has already launched aerial strikes against missiles inside Syria.
Foreign employees on 457 visas can pass the "authenticity" test
The government is considering a "certification" test for foreign employees on 457 visas, as its purpose is to extend a strict procedure.
If this test is adopted, it is applied by means of a standard established in Australia with the aim of preventing 457 to be used for the purpose of filling or transferring incompetent positions to family and friends in a disqualified manner.
A government discussion letter was issued today, condemning the government's vocabulary on foreign workers, former Laber M.P. McCain said today that it could anger the neighboring countries of Australia.
He told the U.S. India Institute today that "foreigners are reaching the end of the line" and the strong statement about "Australian people first work" is a very unpleasant repetition at a time like this, while the Union is a safe one."
Historically, it meant that white workers should have been provided security - and if some people in the area had seen the backbone of that historical evidence, I wouldn't be surprised.
The discussion letter outlines 12 measures, which were first considered by Former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen, said in a statement.
Immigration Minister Brandon O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials about people who were smuggling, has implemented five archival changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criterion is adopted, the examination of the visa applicant may be carried out on the basis that "What is true in circumstances in which the nominated person, the owner of the person sponsoring the visa, or the person in conformity with the person."
Businesses may need to count the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees employed hundreds of people.
During this time, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker, died of a suspected heart attack following arriving on a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man's nine-year-old son had come to Australia on a trip with him, and on Wednesday, after the death of his father, an adult cousin tied him to the frame, which was on the same ship.
Australian officials have taken the person to the Icelandic hospital on Christmas Day, where he died on the same day.
The study has been announced by the British government to increase Scotland's benefits from the HS2 Rail project.
The work by HS2 indicates high-speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kremer said the project would "become a United Kingdom."
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said they are very "interested" by working with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
Upon completion of the second phase, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of building high-speed links between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland transportation, instructed HS2 Limited to consider the possibilities of improving rail capacity and travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of three hours or less of possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
According to Baroness Kremer: "Our goal for HS2 is a real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer."
We are moving forward with HS2, because its benefits will be very high.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capability of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 cities in the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will connect well due to HS2.
"Today's announcement is good news for Scotland," said Scottish Secretary Elistier Carmichael.
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael for Scotland's "clear" return to the HS2 network.
"Scotland is likely to have a heavy economic benefit from high-speed rail, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the whole case of high-speed rail across the UK," Brown said.
Therefore, we are excited to work with the British Government to bring high-speed rail to Scotland, to create benefits for all, and to explore options to meet the Glasgow-Adinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is already building.
I am looking forward to reviewing the Inquiry Report with the Ministers of the British Government next year and taking a decision together on further action.
Aircraft Electrical Equipment Regulations Will Be Effective In Australia Now
The move to soften the equipment in the U.S. regulations will continue to shut down its tablets and smart phones when Australian airline passengers take flight and take off the aircraft.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the option open to U.S. aviation service companies to change their processes, so that passengers during the crucial stages of flight will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices.
Passengers can still do this during many flights, but many people donâ€™t seem to be able to access their e-books when filling in and taking off on a plane, etc.
Australian air service companies are considering this decision, according to which U.S. air service companies will have to do a lot of work to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they do not have an immediate plan to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it is considering the announcement, but stressed that the ban on the use of electrical equipment in the critical stages of flight in Australia is still effective.
"Currently, CASA has no specific regulation controlling the efficiency of electrical equipment in the aircraft," the Authority said, "This issue is subject to regulations, which are subject to the provisions of which the airline is subject to the provisions of the Regulations or the provisions of the Regulations, which are to ensure that the operators of the aircraft"
Virgin, who is already in talks with CASA about expanding the use of her in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but she has asked for further action on the direction of the legislator.
"We will welcome the review by CASA in the case of allowing the use of electrical appliances, because we really think it will provide customers with a better experience, because now we have our (wireless in-flight) standard," the spokesperson said.
Quantas said it will follow the current rules at the moment.
"In accordance with our current policy, electric devices cannot be used during the filling of flights and landing of aircraft, and we have no immediate plan to transform it,"" he said."
The FAA decisions apply to U.S. allergens.
By the way, we are always interested in developments that can benefit passengers and we will certainly consider the FAAâ€™s decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different for each U.S. airline and will depend on the age of its aircraft.
Aviation service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio equipment from mobile devices, as well as they will be able to provide brief details to passengers in their own rules books, training materials, carry-on baggage programs.
"After verifying the tolerance of their aircraft by the airline, the FAA will allow passengers to use lightweight electrical equipment, such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones, holding at all heights,"" the FAA said."
In cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off their equipment during the flight.
The group has also suggested that heavy equipment should be safely placed under the seat during filling and landing during the flight or in the upper boxes.
PONBROCKERS' SILVER CAN BE DIFFERENT BY THE MEDIATE CLASS IN SINGAPUR
Janani Amirathlinga is taking cash to pay her daughter's school fee at a Ponshop in Bendemire Shopping Centre in Singapore, giving her gold collars, rings and skulls.
"""My husband and I recently bought a house, so all our money is trapped in it,"" she said."
They say that, although they earn <0x24>3,000 as a Singaporean administrator (2,400 U.S. dollars), and their husbands also work, the monthly income of the family remains insufficient.
In fact, the same demand in parts of South-East Asia - where domestic debt is growing - is on the rise - at ValuMax, where they are doing their trades, this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Jewelry is not the only way to get cash - in the case of Mrs. Amirathlinga <0x24>1,300 - but almost unsafe bank loans are as cheap as they are.
In general, the Ponbroker in Singapore takes interest of 17 per cent per year, which is slightly higher than the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, which is a local lender whose branch is in the same shopping center.
However, Ponbrokers have the advantage of not having a credit check or salary certificate required, and they can make loans available faster than the bank.
Millions of people in the area are facing Ponshop due to the increasing cost of living by families and the rise in domestic and consumer loans due to difficulties.
After five years of strong growth after the global financial disaster, and cheap credit due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are struggling to meet their needs due to the downturn of their economy.
This week's rating agency, Standards Angels Puyers, described rising domestic profits as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks, mainly due to rising mortgages.
He said that Asia has the highest domestic debt in relation to GDP in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer loan in Thailand, which has emerged slightly from the tech shutdown this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a steady decline in exports and consumer demand.
Economist Song Sang Won, at Malaysian Bank, CIM, said, "The key point is that with rising prices, people coming from [income scale] to the lower class will increase their income in every possible way."
Historically, high prices in gold prices over the past two years have motivated people to keep personal assets down, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to value their familyâ€™s jewelry.
70 per cent of the items deposited in the 200 pound outlet of the city-state in Singapore are gold.
People are saying, "The feeling of gold is good, let's put Grandma's gold chain down, and we'll take it back next month."
Thailand's largest Ponshop manager, Egimani, has seen a 20 per cent increase in the number of customers using its outlet in recent months.
There is so much growth in the holding business that outlet operators in Bendimir and 15 others like it in Valumax and Singapore, not only in their neighbourhood, are planning to expand the workplace in Malaysia, where there are four stores, but also in the vicinity.
The company will use 60 per cent of the <0x24>66 million received in this week's listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange to finance it.
While some discount landers (lenders) have been criticized because of the high interest rates, but Mrs. Yah says that keeping a deposit is not only an inexpensive rate compared to other lenders, but it does not directly incur in the loan.
They say, "Customers hold down on items they already have, and squandering personal assets does not increase domestic debt."
The social acceptance of Ponbroking is increasing in order to obtain short-term and secure financial assistance.
It's not that the Pan-Brokers are only used by financially weak people.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use the ValueMax outlet, they hold gold bars or Rolex watches that can get up to 60 percent cash payments of their purchase price.
We have clients from all sections of the society.
"""These include rich people who need loans for a short period of time for business ventures or investments, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow requirements,"" she said."
Sometimes they just need money in a very short time.

<0x24>325 million package for Tajik's health
The federal government has stressed that the <0x24>325 million bailout package for Tasmania's diseased health system is also linked to tough conditions that will ensure that the state government cannot waste money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the National Assembly, the island state's elderly population, high rates of starch diseases, and "immediate action" are taking to address the existing crisis due to the limits of the system.
The decision on the funding for four years, was taken after consultation of the government with the independent MP of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has brought the Emergency Defence Package, which we believe will solve the special challenges facing the state,"" Mrs Plyberseck said."
The <0x24>325 million package also includes an alternative surgical plan of <0x24>31 million.
A total of 2,600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and thoracic surgeries, will help to resolve the previous cases.
In it, the Walk-in Clinic in Hobart and Lonhesses, better care after going to the hospital, training of medical professionals, mental health services and local hospitals.Including personal electronic health records systems.
"These investments are in line with the best practices told me by leading doctors to improve Tasmania's health system,"" Mrs Plyberseck said."
The Minister stressed that the government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability governance.
The state must maintain the current financial-nutrition level in order to receive the funds from the Commonwealth, and report every month on where the additional funds are being spent.
A three-member commission will be formed to ensure that the service is provided as effectively and efficiently as possible by the State.
Mr. Wilkie said that <0x24>325 million will not mean much until "until real improvements are made to bring the public health system of Tasmania to a more transportable level."
"However, he commended the Government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought before the Prime Minister in early May,"" he said."
Mr. Wilkie said, "I hope that the federal aid package will prove to be very helpful in separating the state's entire public health system from the crisis-harvested list."
According to the State Government, these additional alternative processes will lead to largely pre-emptive cuts made in recent years.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is "Band-Aid solution."
He told ABCTV, "We are here for this reason because the Labour State government has taken <0x24>430 million in its health system.
You can't think of the <0x24>300 million being taken by the state government and given by the Commonwealth as a day of good news.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Mrs. Plyberseck be given a guarantee that not one single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on additional employment.
The best production design and time period in the transformation by Giloum Niklaux of Denis Dederot's novel, but it's been far more than it should have been.
This novel, which dates back to 1760 in France, recounts the sad story of the young man named Suzan Reis, sent by a member of his family to the Convent.
When she rebels, she confronts the hands of the voluntarily stubborn mother superior with extreme cruelty, and becomes the object of an erotic attraction for the other.
This movie never goes into eroticity or sensuality - and that's the problem.
Due to the seriousness of the storytelling, it also risks becoming a boring film for the audience.
CSA vice-president Dr. Munna Singh has decided to charge the entrance fee due to dirt spread in the garden.

The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed its ability to make chemical weapons, the report said.
The monitoring group said on Thursday that Syria had destroyed critical equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas war materials, while a fierce conflict erupted in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the site of the poison.
On Thursday, the Syrian movement group said that nearly 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, which began nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before the end date of November 1.
The organization, based in The Hague, had designated Damascus to destroy or "make ineffective" the machinery used to merge chemicals in all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and fill in war materials.
Mainly completing the initial phase of destruction, this ambitious event is a significant milestone aimed at destroying all the chemical weapons of Damascus by the middle of the year 2014.
Destruction of the device means that Syria can no longer build new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the existing weapons and collections.
It is believed that Syria currently has 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including master gas and nerve agent sarin.
The situation in the United Kingdom Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that the announcement occurred at the time when the conflict in the city of Safira on Thursday escalated, which experts believe is the same as the chemical weapons production unit.
The movement group, which details the number of deaths through the movement's network in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have been killed.
Of these, 6,365 children, including 61,067 common citizens, he said.
On behalf of the government, 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad's military, 18,678 are fighters in favour of the government and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
The death toll also includes 2,202 army battalions and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that nearly 100,000 people had died in the fighting since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
Nearly 20 million people have been forced to leave the country as a result of the conflict.
Assad's army had been fighting with rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of whom were associated with al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said that people on both sides were injured, but clearly did not say anything.
This war reflects the threat faced by inspectors of chemical weapons, who have a mission to end toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war in a very short time frame.
The statement on behalf of the OPCW, which co-operated with the United Nations, said that its team is "satisfied and has confirmed this - and has seen all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/releasing equipment - as being destroyed."
It also said, "No further inspection activity is being planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said that they had completed the first stage of the confirmation work at 21 of the 23 centers declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to go to two centers for security reasons.
On Friday, OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centers "are given over and ... chemical weapons products placed there were delivered to other declared centers, which have been inspected," the statement said.
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira was one of those two centres, where the O.P.C.W. was unable to go to the inspector.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW next month.
In a comment issued by OPCW, General Director of the Monitoring Group, Ahmat Ujumku said, "I congratulate you on the strength and courage shown by the people in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization."
The civil war has been going on for three years, mainly between the government of Assad and its security forces, which include members of the Al-White Panth, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
Rami Abdurrahman, head of the observatory, said on Wednesday that a massive explosion had taken place at the air defense center in the Syrian coastal region of Latakia.
The cause of the blast is not yet known, he said.
The police have recovered photocopies of the detained registers, detained stamps, detained laptops and detained registers.
The Moti Nagar police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Parmajit Singh Gil said that Rajiv Agarwal of Chandra Nagar in Habowal is among the detainees, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Kumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Ghaggi of Koha and Gurindhar Singh Ghaggi of Khumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar Office (East) has escaped the spot.
According to the police, the accused, along with the Clerk and Recorder of the Registrar's Office, Balbir Singh, was taking out paperwork from the records of empty and old lands and was subsequently buying new stamp paper.
This was not the case with the real registry that had since disappeared into the registry record.
Subsequently, the accused sold the land for Rs.
At the same time, they borrowed these papers.
Subsequently, the real owner of the land was held accountable to the police and the administration.
The accused, who prepared the jali registry, had special care for the lands of the NRIG.
Because there is no one to oversee the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell those lands that are grounded registers.
Police Commissioner Gil said the accused said in the interrogation that he had prepared some 150 records so far.
According to the police, there have been cases of fraud and theft against the group in the past.
Convicted of conspiracy to detonate a bomb in Bali
The families and relatives of 202 people who were killed in the bomb blast in 2002, angering the convicted conspirator of the bomb blast, said Umar Patek should face the fire team.
Patek, who had been running as one of the most wanted individuals in Southeast Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years yesterday for his role in the construction of the explosive device used in the bomb blast.
When the passport is issued, it can be released in 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many wounded.
He was also found guilty of many other allegations related to terrorism, including a serialized bomb blast in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors had demanded life imprisonment, although they could also demand that the death penalty of the person known as the "destructive person" as the master person who made the bomb be the death penalty.
The decision revived the painful memories of June Cortin, a woman living in Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a decade ago in a destructive attack by Patek Patek and her co-operatives.
Stopping his hopes, he said that Patek should have been given a death warrant.
I really feel that he should have received the same punishment as other horrendous terrorists.
Ms. Cortin told A.A.P., "She should be standing in front of the firefighting team."
I have to live every day without my grandparents and my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, just after 11 p.m., the name of the club was removed following the explosion of the bomb loaded in the van outside the entire club.
Peter Hughes was in the pajamas bar just 20 seconds before the explosive bagpack was exploded by the suicide bombers.
They went into a coma for a month as a result of the explosion and died three times during their stay on life-saving devices.
Mr. Hughes says that Patek should have received the same sentence, which three other members of the Jammah Islamiyah terrorist group responsible for the genocide - Amaroji, Mukhalas and Imam Sedra - had been sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be given the death penalty before someone else.
There's no reason to keep him alive, there's no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless people, it is not enough to get a 20-year sentence.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of the Bali bombings.
He had been avoiding being arrested for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in Abtabad, Pakistan, in January 2011, where the U.S. Army had killed former Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the F.B.I. Agent had presented evidence that the report found that contact between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaeda was reinstated in an attempt to meet Bill Laden.
Mrs. Cortin says, "She did not surrender."
Even today, he doesnâ€™t really feel the pain of suffering so many people mentally.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"""This year will be a lot of tears,"" Mrs. Cortin said."
Patek is still able to appeal against his sentence.
F.A.A.: Air passengers can now use gadgets in the air (but can't call from cell phone)
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic device to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music from entering the gate. But they won't be able to talk to their cellphones - by the wayside - by the wayside on Thursday.
But passengers should not immediately expect these changes.
At a news conference, F.A.A.'s administrator Michael Huerta said how quickly these changes are implemented, it will be different for each airline.
F.A.A. will have to show F.A. to F.A. how their aircraft, new guidelines are met, and the training manuals of the members of their crew to show the guidelines. Such as the rules for the collection of devices.
The F.A.A. has already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic devices on the plane, he said.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already presented the plans.
"Based on the status of the project, we can very quickly approve the expanded use of the electronic device," the F.A.A. said in a statement.
At the moment, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the aircraft's doors are closed.
They are expected not to turn them on until they reach the altitude of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and are allowed by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their device again when the plane is landing, and do not turn it on until the plane is fully landed.
"""Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic interference can fill their passengers by plane,"" the FAA said, """in accordance with the new guidelines, they can fill their passengers by plane, while flying the aircraft, while accompanying the use of the device during takeoff and taxiing.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Most of the new airlines and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Gleding, president of the Association of Professional Flight Atendents, has welcomed these changes.
"When the policy will be safely implemented - and we will work with airlines to do so - it will be a win-win for both sides," Glading said in a statement.
When it comes to this issue, we are bored by feeling like "hall monitors."
The agency said, however, that surfing the Internet at a height of less than 10,000 feet, exchanging emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still be prohibited.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversation with friends, a game like online scrabble, which is associated with the famous event that when actor Alec Baldwin, while staying at the airport at the door, was playing on his smartphone while he was staying at the airport.
And heavy equipment such as laptops etc. will still have to be collected because their exit will worry about hurting the other person in the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be banned during the flight.
The Federal Communications Commission has the legal rights related to telephone calls, not the F.A.A.
F.A.A. may remove restrictions on some electronic devices during the flight of the aircraft and during the landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenken, the National Transportation Safety Board's national transport security expert at CBS News, said the cell phone is still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are actually a serious issue, not only because they may potentially cause interference in the navigation-related device, but also because they may cause interference in cell phone towers when in the air,"" Rojenkar said."
In order to investigate this issue, the Industry World Advisory Committee, set up by F.A.A., last month established that the government should allow more use of individual electronic devices.
The F.A.A. has been under increasing pressure in recent years to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics like Sen. Claire McKaskill, D-Mo, have said there is no legitimate reason for the ban.
The implementation of these restrictions is becoming even more difficult because the use of the device is widespread.
Some studies also show that nearly a third of the passengers forget or ignore the instructions to shut down their device.
The F.A.A. began to prohibit the use of electronic devices by passengers in the year 1996, when the passengers took F.M. Radio and the high-tech gadgets of the time. Recipe of interference in navigation and communication equipment was received.
New airlines are more dependent on the electric system than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by the F.A. to be resistant to electronic interference.
The airline has been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes from passengers for many years.
The aircraft modified for the Wi-Fi system is also more resistant to interference.
Huerta said that most airlines should meet the eligibility criteria for more use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, the airline said.
Today's electronic devices emit very low-power radio transmissions compared to the previous-generation electronics devices, the company said.
For example, e-readers, there is a transmission of absolutely nominative during page rotation.
But when the data is downloaded or sent by the device, the transmission is dominant.
Amazon.com has also been on the side of reducing restrictions on the use of the device by passengers.
In 2011, the company's officials loaded all of its kindle e-readers into the airline and flew him to test for problems, but no such problem was found.
The F.A.A. Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks associated with the use of the device.
"National Aviation Passengers' Union's Douglas Kid said he believes that the violation of the device is real, whether the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said, there are only reports described by the pilot in support of the device being disrupted in the aircraft system, most of which are too old.
However, the members of the committee held that the F.A.A. pilots were allowed to order the passengers to shut down the device when the aircraft landed in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and it is a common knowledge facility for people who are traveling in the latest round of technology.
C.E. Do, of the U.S. Travel Association, said that we are pleased that the F.A.A. recognizes that the passenger who travels with joy is not incompatible with defence and security.

The bird was left back in the jungle by air transport to protect itself from North C Rig
The bird found landed on North C Oil Rig has been left back in the jungle by air transport.
The water-rail bird was sent back to its Aloe-based rescue centre by the Scottish SPCA by a helicopter before recovering.
"This water rail was probably the winter migratory bird of northern Europe, which came to the fore of the strong winds over the North Sea," said Center Manager Colin Seden.
It seems that the bird was tired and he took refuge on the oil rig.
He further stated: "It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help."
The water rails had been well and repaired before leaving.
Is the high class of Europe ready to do business with the UK?
Business for the UK was launched in April and it was pledged to bring the business together and to determine what changes we want to see in our relationship with the UK's employment and prosperity maker E.U.
For it, we conducted the largest and most comprehensive surveys of UK business leaders, asking them what they think about the UKâ€™s business with the E.U..
U-Gov has raised the minds of 1000 business leaders, who represent the UK's business size, regions and locations.
The results of this survey can be surprising to many people.
We found that a large proportion of businesses now want to export out of Europe, and want to focus on those countries that are becoming modern and growing, while the E.U. member countries are becoming impulsive.
They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than interfere in the long-term and vicious process of reforming the secret institutions of the EU.
When asked about specific policy areas such as monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive qualifications should come back to the Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market could very easily be seen, businessmen say that the price of regulation of Brussels is far more than the benefits of being part of the European trade area. The 40-year-old was even a huge businessman who was traditionally
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that, a large part clearly wants to move forward on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change with the UK, rather than politics.
This finding, seen at the levels of the major business groups, showed that the business is driving towards a "profitable change" that will bring the U.K. back its lost power.
Its price is very high - the issue of treaty changes for the UK and getting a better deal changed by 16 per cent in favor of staying in the U.S. in the vote-gathering.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: it is the survey respondent who supports his plan to negotiate the terms of Britain's membership in the United Kingdom, the U.S.
It has also shown that the businessman expects the current power balance to re-examine a significant change in favour of the U.K.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and very quickly it is becoming mandatory, as the eurozone, the related economy, and the fiscal union are taking a step forward.
The priority should be jobs and growth in the UK itself, as our survey findings show that this means for businesses a new focus on business and a new focus on the regulatory approach of Brussels. Based on the regulatory approach.
Gazprom's Alexi Miller announces the start of a new round of pipeline in Bulgaria
The head of Gazprom said the arm of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the arm of Europe's largest energy projects.
"Today, a historic event has taken place: the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gas Pipeline has been constructed, which is the largest and most important project in Europe," said Gazprom President Alexey Nagar Nagar in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream will provide diversity in Russia's export routes to Europe.
Officials said, Ukraine, where Russia has the bulk of gas for Europe, poses a risk to a dispute over the conventional routes between Gazprom's counterpart and Gazprom's contract.
Miller said that a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means the end of the geo-political risks associated with the transit countries "for the sake of peace."
Bulgarian customers will receive gas at discounted rates from the South Stream after the entire project has been operationalized in 2015.
Gazprom said that construction should begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for the annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

The Royal Commission has heard allegations of sexual offences against two employees of the YMCA prior to the charges against Jonathan Lord
Before being charged against Caringbah childcare employee Jonathan Lord in 2011, two employees of Y.M.C.A.N.S.W. have been charged with child sexual offences.
But in a statement before the Commission, it said it "never faced a case of child sexual harassment within its organization," the Commission was informed.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Greene was asked about the case in which an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography crimes, and another case in which the YMCA Carringbah Instr.
Mr. Greene, a lawyer assisting the Commission, said he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also admitted that the statement of the YMCA before the Commission that "the external investigation of the YMCA has been undertaken and he has found the YMCA to be at the forefront in the case of child safety" is also not accurate.
It is evidence before the Commission that the YMCA was notified, and it received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Greene, who has been associated with the age of 21 years with the YMCA, admitted that the appointment of Lord has failed to manage "self-including me", and it has failed to ensure that the employees have failed to comply with the child protection policy violations
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences with 12 children during a two-year term in the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr. Greene rejected the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in the YMCA, due to which the employees did not report the violation of the child safety by Lord.
Employees gave evidence of what they saw about the violation, whereby Lord spent time alone with the children, personalized babysitting them, sitting them in adoption, telling them that he loves them and letting them play on his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the supervision of Lord, and she was speaking for the training of hair safety, because she was concerned about her behavior, testified that the M.C.A. Carringbah Hair Service Management was the only one who was in charge of the Lord's supervision.
C.E.O. said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not easy to inform above their manager.
He said, rather than his friendship with Lord, his decision to inform him was misleading.
Mr. Greene said that he had provided the Y.M.CA.N.S.W. to the Church with his view that the text from "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not giving notice" to the organization.
Mr. Greene said the decision to sign the Privacy Agreement by the employees only immediately after the indictment was made by the child service manager of YMCA, Law Whitele.
Its purpose was to avoid the combination of evidence, he said, but it was not "extremely" and correctly executed.
Stephen Smalbone, Special Professor of Child Sexual Exploitation at Griffith University, said that during his stay at the work of Jonathan Lord between 2099 and 2011, the YMCA was not a secure organization.
He said there were "serious problems" in the appointment, accompaniment, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been postponed until December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to the UK
Tony Blair said they would like a chance to become Britain's prime minister again - but they believe there is no chance of a return.
In an interview with the Prime Minister on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving office in June 2007 after a decade as a leader, most of his remarks were limited to his role as a representative of foreign affairs and the peace founders of the Middle East group. Mr. Blair debated the British policy
Asked whether they would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair was presented by the London Ewing Standard newspaper saying: "Yes, of course, but it's not likely that this will happen, so..."
He urged leaders not to ignore the trading community after the financial crisis, he said.
When the crowd of experts who performed the horse for the best horse of the year gathered in Cardiff, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even now going to school and a few months away from taking her first step, this little child and her Palut Shetland Tuttu Taffey easily completed three stages and won the top prize - she won her 30-year-old contestant.
In the annual competition held by the Suneback Equestrian Centre in Cardiff, the pair that can't be separated - which is the same length - was highly appreciated for the appearance, behavior and style of the Sk.
In front of the beautiful men and women wearing a baller hat, he shaved his flat hat at the alder angle and took his two-year-old cup of tea to the ring.
The decision-makers praised Fenton for his natural ability to control, which is far ahead of his age.
And Toffee got the highest score for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given toffee as a gift on his third birthday last March, and he has practiced with this turtle from Shetland every day since.
Her 30-year-old mother, Dona, said: "Fonton and Toffee are a great couple."
They had to face the challenge from all the contenders, but they both won the Gold Cup and the Rosette.
This was only the second chance, when he participated in a competition with Toffee, and we are all very happy about his victory.
The most distinctive in this landscape, he felt all so amazing that they wanted to stretch the photo with him.
This young child of the Nantiglo village near Ab Well, South Wales is walking in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells who has been performing horses for more than 10 years.
"""The whole place was full of excitement, and everyone was celebrating happiness and playing the ball,"" Mr. Howells said."
He was running on the blue in all the colors, and even though he looked so small, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is a breeder of animals - he loves horses, tractors and farming, and he has two hens he cares for.
He's going to be in the best horse show of the year long ago - and I'm confident he'll perform very well.
A spokesman for the annual Horse Exhibition said: "Fonton is only three years old, but he comes to control his turtle."
They are a very good couple.
The decision-makers scored, taking into account the manner in which Fanton and Toffee performed and the way in which they were presented in the show rings.
He saw the good team work between Tuttu and his rider - in this case, Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm completely convinced that Fenton's lovely clothes have helped him, he was actually looking very different.
The Chinese newspaper's "Germany" is going to be
A Chinese newspaper that had made an appeal on the homepage to leave a reporter guilty of homicide would be sabotaged, a press official said.
The New Express newspaper of Guangdong had given a viral public prosecution for the release of journalist Chen Yongju.
But after him, Mr. Chen admitted on television that, he had taken a bribe to write news about the state-owned partially owned company.
Vinyamak said that the New Express now has to go through a "complete reform."
The order of "Sudhar" came from the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express of Yangcheng Ewing News Group printed a lot of false news about the listed company Joomlain in the period from September 2012 to August 2013.
Viniyamak said in a statement that "New Express's editorial management was unstable."
He said it had taken the decision "to impose an administrative penalty by cancelling the license of the reporter of Chan Yongju."
It "instructed the Yangcheng Ewing News Group to complete a reform of the New Express, in New Express the structure of investigating the people responsible for it and immediately revising the leadership team of the New Express."
Mr. Chen had written in the New Express many articles blaming financial irregularities in a construction-equipment company called Joomlaline.
Following his dismissal, his newspaper issued two main-page appeals for his release, saying he supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after him, Mr. Chen agreed to come to state television, writing and publishing false stories for money.
He told State Broadcaster CCTV: "In this case, I have detrimentalized Joomlaline as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win people's confidence."
I did this mainly because I was passionate about money and fame.
I am aware of my mistakes.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express issued a homepage apology, saying it had failed to properly inquire into his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have admitted to the fault transmitted by the TV.
Experts say that from time to time a strong acknowledgment of guilt is made, despite the fact that at the end of this year a law had prohibited the authorities from compelling a person to be guilty.

U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel found its own railway
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels has been found between the U.S. and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
U.S. officials have described the four-foot-three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes discovered so far.
The tunnel is equivalent to the staircase length of about six football pitches, which connects the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is filled with warehouses such as one, which makes it easy to hide the truck that is being filled with drugs.
Officials said it had been shut down before a drug passed through the tunnel.
According to the Court's records, officials have seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the discovery of the tunnel.
Three people, of whom officials said they were acting as drivers, were accused of being detained with marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distributing.
If convicted, he may be sentenced to 10 years in prison to life imprisonment.
Traders in Nogales, Arizona, benefit from huge underground drainage ducts.
This tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Diego since 2006.
In October, some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after the marijuana crop in central Mexico, which enables drug mafia groups to present the challenge of how they can quickly deliver the product to consumers.
In 2010, officials found a track of about 700 gauges equipped with rail tracks, which had spread from the chimney of a house in Tizana to the San Diego warehouses.

British police sent a notice of extradition to Assange
The British police sent a delivery notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange today, who has taken refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that he has sent a "delivery notice" to the 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he will have to be present at the police station, as well as saying that he would have been arrested if he failed to do so.
Assange is facing extradition in Sweden as a result of allegations of sexual offences, as well as his choice under British law expired at the time while the Supreme Court had filed an appeal against the extradition earlier this month.
Stokeham would take him to the U.S., fearing that he would ask the South American country for political asylum, had applied for asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19.
A spokesman said Scotland Yard had "sended Assange, a 40-year-old, a self-dedication notice for which he needed to be present at the police station on the date and time chosen by us."
He is in violation of the terms of his guarantee.
The embassy refused to comment on the notice given to the police.
Asanje fears that due to the release of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on a privacy-anti-WikiLeaks website, the U.S. will be transferred from Sweden to face potential espionage charges.
Penalty of 1000 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) for driving a car at 130 miles per hour with hot drinks between the feet
On the driver, he was fined 1,000 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) for driving at a speed of 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) by putting a hot drink between his feet.
Tiptry, 35-year-old Andrew Hove of Aces was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Brantrie on May 27.
When the police stopped them, they found a tech-avenue drink on their feet.
Hovey has admitted the prosecution of negligent driving in the Kolchester Magistrate Court.
He added seven points to his license, which resulted in a six-month driving ban on him.
Hove was also ordered to pay a fee of 90 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>90) and a surcharge of 100 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>100).
Taxes on foreign property owners will end London's artificial status.
The Finance Department has consistently calculated the CGT measures, but is awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osborne, who has put more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million in the 2012 budget at a cost of <0xC2><0xA3>7 per house, and a person who is a private individual
The stamp duty, which was obtained from residential properties in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Church in 2012/13, was <0xC2><0xA3>708 million, which was already in Northern Ireland, North Yorkshire, North Wales, North Wales, and North Wales.
"After the increase in the stamp duty of high-value houses and the introduction of associated anti-evaodens legislation, it is very difficult to argue that there is no such thing as a fairly low tax on high-value property," said Shri Cook.
"But this move could make some foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London and reluctant to sell to current owners," he added.
The top 5 to 10 per cent of the housing market, which has spread from Fullham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8 per cent last year, according to the price in Dharma South-West London.
According to Saviles' research, prices in central London continued to rise by 5.6 per cent each year, but the rising "domestic market" seemed to be slightly less than looking at, as the southwest (6.5 per cent) of the city was in the east, (7.4 per cent).
Scientists have also highlighted the relationship between the behaviors of the dog's tail and its mood.
Recent research has found that happy dogs move their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while non-church dogs move their tails mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that companion dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of the tail and express their reaction to it.
The study has been published in the journal Korant Biology.
Professor of Neuroscientists from the University of Trento, Georgia Wellartiga, said: "In humans, it's all well known that the left and right parts of the brain are stimuli that involve different stimuli that are negative."
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He noted that even in dogs like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for the movements of the left hand and the opposite order, and the two goalkeepers played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to unilateral beatings by other dogs, the researchers looked at animals watching other dogs' movies.
He measured the heartbeats of the pet dogs and analyzed their behaviors.
It will probably not take us much longer to understand why their duo sometimes moves on one side, sometimes on the other.
Prof. Wellartiga said: "We introduced the dogs with dog movies - in a realistic version or in the shadow-picture to deal with other issues that confuse, and we could only see the action of the tail" and squeeze the tail more or less.
When the animals saw a senseless dog pushing his tail to the right (from the dogâ€™s view), they were completely at ease.
But when they saw the tail turning mainly to the left (from the dog's sight), their heartbeat increased and they looked unconscious.
According to Prof. Wellartiga, they do not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these actions.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from their experience what behavior they should be concerned about and what not.
"If you've met several times with other dogs, and if they constantly move their tails one way, it's related to more friendly behavior, and the right side presents less friendly behavior, you react on the basis of the same experience," he said.
The researchers say that these findings can provide better information about the emotions of animals to owners, veterinarians and trainers.
Felo, a guest of the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said that this is not the first study to check whether the left or right part is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that when dogs see an aggressive dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the right when they see a happy dog.
In another study by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Unlike the Italian study - when the dog's tail was pushed to the left rather than the right, the dog's tail was closer to him than to being unconscious."
He said the difference was due to the fact that in various studies, dogs in movies did not fully understand animals or robot dogs breathing.
He made it clear that studying the way dogs can react to real dogs can help in this.
"While there has been sufficient evidence from various mammals that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information remains to be obtained - and there are no exceptions to dogs in this case," he said.
However, considering how easily their behavior can be recorded, it seems that it will probably not take us longer to understand why their thumb ever moves on one side, sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys Suspended Glasgo Gig Due to Alex Turner's Disease
The Arctic Monkey Bank has suspended the Gig in Glasgow after suffering from his lead singer's constipation.
The Sheffield Group was scheduled to perform at the hydro site in the city on Friday.
But his lead singer Alex Turner's illness forced him to re-establish the date of the show.
The band's announcement came at a time when they were obliged to postpone Gig in LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: Following the decision to postpone the show at LG Arena in Birmingham tonight after taking medical advice, Arctic Monkeys will also be taking part in the event on 1 November in Glasgow Highway.
"Alex Turner was found to have been congested in the investigation, and they are not sadly able to perform."

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February
The Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term of office on February 22.
Cardinals have the highest-ranking pastors in the Catholic Church, their posts are only below the Pope, and that is what people choose the Pope, so Francis will take over the first group of his individuals, who will eventually help to choose their successor.
There are currently a total of 201 cardinals.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the election of the pope - it comes in the group of 120 "cardinal voters".
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the celebration of the promotion of the new cardinals, a meeting of all the existing cardinals will be held, which is called the Pope's Council.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to hold the Pope's Council of February in advance, so as to simplify the planning of other meetings involving the Cardinals from different countries of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero, of the Catholic Voices, said that by February the number of cardinal voters was likely to decline.
In general, the number of cardinal voters as few as 120, the cardinals as they wish, and the cardinals over 80 years of age as they wish, he said.
The next year's Pope's meeting will be important, Valero said, as it will be the first pope's meeting after the election of Francis in March this year.
At the moment, there is a kind of prejudice towards Europe and Italy in particular.
"It would be interesting to see if the new Pope nominates Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of the Roman Catholics in South America, but their number in the Cardinals is very low.
Cardinals Council by Francis - a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, whose work is to seek ways of reforming the Church, will also be the first cardinals to be elected after being formed.
Before that, the Pope had made his own decisions.
"Right now, France has chosen these eight cardinals to help," Valero said.
He said it is "possible" that Francis Cardinals should seek advice.
But we're not in this situation before - it's completely new.
Valero said that in general the pope gives the post of cardinal to bishops of major places, but Francis was "completely surprising - so we don't know whose name they will announce."
G.M. recalled pickup trucks in the U.S. to correct seatback
According to a statement from U.S. Auto Security Lawyers on Friday, General Motors Company, its brand new 2014 Sheaverle Silverado and GMC Sira pickup trucks are hand-wrapped in a 19,000-car seatbag in a
In some trucks there may be a reduction in the front seat rotation system.
As a result, the seatback, the union failed to comply with the auto safety standards regarding the head-restaurant.
According to a notice posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, "If the vehicle is trapped from the rear, it is possible that the head restraint, the driver cannot properly protect, thereby increasing the risk of injury."
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1st and September 10th.
The truck of G.M. began to be dispatched in June and, after the 2009 Diwaliapan renewal, it represents the most important car launch for the top U.S. automaker.
G.M. had informed the truck owners of the fault in late October.
N.S.T.M.A. was unable to review the owner notice due to a 16-day government detention, which had prevented the increase in auto sales in October.
G.M. said on Friday that the sales of Silverado and Sira trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, had an increase of 20 per cent in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, G.M. sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sira pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, G.M.'s shares on the New York Stock Exchange were up by 1.4 per cent.
Obama's voters are disappointed.
I voted for Obama twice in anticipation of change.
He says Obama's major efforts have been disrupted due to GOP's blocking policy.
The blocking policy cannot excuse the abuses of the Obamacare website, the drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign commemorates things that could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books today.
This is a book about which I think it will stimulate my enthusiasm during my second year of medical school poisoning and awaken the ray of hope in me.
It's called "the courage to win," and it's the memory of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I find the brilliance of my patientsâ€™ particles at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a circle where politics had inspired millions of people and speeches could have stopped you from breathing.
Elections were unilaterally proven, and news speakers had paused to reflect the historical importance of the time.
My colleagues had a sense of joy in their eyes, and my parents kept all the newspapers they received.
A group of young people were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
When he became President of Obama in 2008, he had an approval rating of 82 percent.
And then I closed the book.
The reality of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to remember a distant, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
After the vote for the first time, there has been a real change.
To put it simply, none of this could have been imagined.
"I credit Obama with many achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the return of our army from Iraq to the end of the "Don't ask me" until Osama bin Laden is killed.
In addition, I believe that the policy of opposition has prevented many of our country's efforts to move forward: including immigrant reform, public options for health services, shutting down the airport at Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But the countless times when I take my side in front of my colleagues and colleagues the Obama administration - I have an answer that ends because I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
The anti-republican policy is not a response to the espionage of foreign leaders, nor is it a response to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the collection of data about the privacy of ordinary American citizens by the National Security Agency nor can it respond to the prosecution of people exposing misconduct by the government.
This could not explain the cause of the murder of a US citizen Anwar El Avalaki without a trial, nor the public funds and spending limits were less during the president's campaign.
It cannot respond to the findings of the report, saying that the White House's attempts to silence the media "are the most offensive to date since the Nixon administration."
And most recently, this cannot excuse the failure of designing a simple website even three years after it was signed into the Act of Infortable Care.
I don't know if I had hoped for it.
If, at the age of 18, I should have assumed that the governance system could mingle the political campaign that would bring it forward.
It is clear that the elected office is not a predictable path, as anti-political parties and incidents such as Newtown assassinations will give shape to our public discussion.
However, as I have pointed out above, most of them seem to be self-selected by the administration.
This is what bothers you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his prospects.
Mitt Romani presented a confusing and uncertain option, which did not appear to determine his policies or his posts.
I thought that a second term for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hopes that we have been hearing about for a long time.
However, while Obama's approval rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return in the year 2008 through that book.
When I see him, I remember the promises he made.
This week, a part of the book was reading, describing how much Clinton suffered as a result of Obama's losses in the Pennsylvania Premiere.
At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his submissive employees that they need to return to the patriot, and that they need to remain true to their goals.
"""I want to get my mojo back."
We need to remember who we are."
Today, five years later, Mr. President, I can no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are of Nathaniel Morris.
P.M. Tony Abbott's interest in patriotic holiday scheme has been claimed by Clive Palmer
Prime Minister Tony Abbott's interest in the paternity holiday plan is a conflict as his daughters may become pregnant, and may benefit from it, said M.P. Clive Pammar.
Maharthi of the mining sector, who is in dispute over the <0x24>6 million carbon tax bill payment, has claimed, while he has tried to answer questions about the conflict.
The PAM may control up to four votes in the United Party Senate, which may be important in determining whether to reduce carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only the ministers' interests can be conflicted, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from policies.
"Mr. Pammar said, """She may have a significant conflict of interest in the case of paternity leave, because if any of her daughters are pregnant, she would have a direct interest in whether or not she got a leave."
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes after the fall again.
Mr. Pammar called for the acceleration of the electoral count to speed up the process.
Tony Aut's daughters, Fransez and Bridget.
Should the results of the election come two months after we have voted?
"""We should have a better system,"" he said."
Why can't we have a system in which we fill out our statement on the computer, vote immediately, and we have a result at 6:30 p.m.
Mr. Pammar also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballots.
That's because if someone doesn't like him, can they delete him?
The use of pencils in today's cycle is quite absurd.
The Electoral Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint presentation letter with New Zealand, a spokesperson for the Electoral Commission.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his policies include the construction of an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and they take their new work "very seriously."
Public posts are for public service.
"We don't need any other award except the award of history that we can serve the community at this crucial time,"" he said."
This led to problems for the contestants.
Speaking at the meeting on the occasion, Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed his intense anger at the deteriorating law-enforcement in the state.
"""The fast-growing attacks on lawyers and their families show that the criminals have become fearless,"" he said."
There is no fear of the police and the administrative system on them.
Referring to recent incidents of this kind in different places, he said that when the advocacy society is not secure, the security of the common man can be easily predicted.
RBS has suspended two forex traders.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has deposed two traders of its foreign exchange department, two experts from the case have received this information, it is another indication that the currency is a suspected herphere in the market. By lawmakers and lawyers
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Dutch Bank and RBS, have confirmed that the world's largest financial market, with <0x24>5.3 trillion in exchanges each day, they are collaborating with politicians in the investigation.
The two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been postponed as the investigation of a case that appears to be a recurrence of the Libor Interbank Loan Harfer Cond moves forward.
Refusing to comment on the extension, the bank has confirmed that the bank has received a request for information from the legislators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, "Our investigation in this case continues, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators."
Last month, experts from the case had said that RBS had sent the former trader and sent the archives of emails and instant messages received from them to the UK Legislative, Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader named Richard Eusher had left RBS in 2010, and it is believed that he has been discharged from his current position of European head of Forex Spot Trading in J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramachandani, head of European spot trading in the city, went on vacation last week, while the previously senior Karency trader in Barclays and UBS was postponed by the standard charter this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Experts from the case said that Mr. Eushar's quick message group includes bankers from Barklaz and Citigrup.
UBS said, after being told by Swiss lawmaker Finma that he is investigating the suspicious harfer of the foreign exchange market in many Swiss backs, this week he has taken action against some of his employees.
Globally, at least six authorities - European Commission, Finnish Competition Authority, Switzerland's Vico, FCA, U.S. Department of Justice, and Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are being taxed on bankers for their favourable discounts on the foreign exchange market.
The acquaintances of the case said that HSBC, Citygroup, J.P.Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or have received a request for information from the legislators.
Banks have been investigating fast-paced messages and emails for several years in search of a bug of misconduct.
The news about the investigation-crawling, has given havoc to traders in the region, who have been one of the most profitable major individuals in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but are facing the challenge of this year's low-risk because of the fact that they are the main beneficiaries in the trading unit.
Some bankers have tried to suppress the case by saying that it is impossible to harfe in the very large and extremely liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say it is not necessary that this is true.
The senior trader said that despite the overwhelming volume of foreign exchange purchase-sales, the distribution of liquidity between different trading platforms and the accumulation of taxes by banks can mean the increasing use of their own platforms "
The news came the same day that Credit Suisse announced that the trader would be serviced from its London-based exchange fund desk this week, which had lost nearly <0x24>6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its legislators.
"We believe that the trader had done the job alone, and he has been controlled,"" said Credit Suisse."

We can't do our job without money.
Life is one of the greatest needs of money for life, but it is not in our interest to take it all.
We celebrate Krishna Triodshi of Karthik Mass.
Dhanteras is worshipped by the god of wealth Kuber and the deity of death Yamraj.
We have an important place in our religion and in our lives.
No money is good or bad.
We have a positive attitude towards money-making.
No other thing can be more valuable than the wealth that came from the work of the welfare of mankind, but it does not make any sense to that which has caused the dishonesty of wealth.
We must earn money for the sacred purpose and spend it for the sacred purpose.
Earning money for the family is the duty of every person.
Some parts of it should also have a sense of spending on society, but the inexhaustible collection or the tendency to earn Yen-Ken-performance money destroys our conscience, personality.
The feeling of giving should always be in mind.
A portion of the money you give can also be the basis of someone's life.
Many people in society are living in a terrible shortage for them, we should all think for them.
In fact, the meaning, the religion, the work and the moksha have been given equal importance in the men of life.
Everyone wishes for wealth and success, and according to their masculinity, they also get wealth and success.
It is the same property with which respect is associated.
No matter how wealthy a criminal may be, he can neither consume it properly nor do the work of another.
If you have any other money, don't get it.
True wealth is the one who has made the way to flow in the innumerable hands of wealth.
There can be no more use of money than the creation of employment for others.
Money isn't just a currency.
It was also as much as your health, character, love for others.
Try to be the owner of this money.

BJP Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who arrived in Pune to inaugurate a part of Dinanath Mangeshkar Hospital, attacked Congress on Friday addressing an electoral assembly.
"""Sometimes a coalition government was formed in many states and centers of the country, sometimes a government of Congress, sometimes a government of Communists, sometimes a government of BJP."
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call on the political leaders and economists of the country.
There are a number of parameters to be determined in the country.
What the team did.
If there are comparative results, the question of whether or not the BJP government should come before the country will not be raised.
Wherever the BJP government is to be, there has been an effort to meet the public aspirations.
The country has witnessed low prices in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man had two hours of food.
But when the Congress or its backing government was formed, the poor man was not forced to eat full.
A single Congress leader, a single UPA leader, is not responding to what he has done in nine and a half years.
Even the media in our country can't reach them.
The Congress has been disrespected.
They don't even respond to the media.
The election is from the Lok Sabha, you answer the people.
"""In 2014, when the people bless the BJP, they will present their work in front of the public every year,"" Modi said, addressing the attack on Congress leader Kapil Sibal."
Democracy in Delhi should not be a ruler, but a servant.
There must be no slave in Delhi, there must be no slave in Delhi.
Friends of Congress are leaving the balls on the day.
So, my friends, we've already passed the exam 10 months ago.
Democracy is the only way for the people.
In the case of Northel patents, an economic case has been filed against Google, Samsung, Huai.
The group, which owns thousands of former Northtel patents, on Thursday filed many patent lawsuits against Google, including cell phone manufacturers, which it had dumped in the Northtel Diwali auction.
Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., HTC Corporation, Inc., which had purchased Norettel patents in <0x24>4.5 billion, has filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, BlackBerry, Erikson, and Sony.
Google has been accused of violating seven patents.
The prosecution said that these patents also include the technology that combines the search words on the Internet with the words from consistent advertising, which is the main part of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huai, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is strongly opposed to Apple's and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of <0x24>900 million for Northtel patents.
Google has finally offered <0x24>4.4 billion in bids, several times increasing in bids.
After losing to Rockstar in Northtel patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for <0x24>12.5 billion, one of the main reasons for which Motorola had a long list of patents.
The prosecution said that "Despite losing attempts to acquire patents in Nealami, Google has also violated, and is consistently violating."
Rockstar has demanded an increased compensation against Google, as according to the allegations, the infringement of patents by Google is irretrievable.
He believed in the first independently elected president of Egypt.
Mohammad Morsi has sworn in his post, but his victory day could barely end the political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammad Morsi vowed to "new Egypt" when he took the oath of office as the country's first independently elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who had been deposed 16 months ago.
On his formal inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi was the first independently elected Islamist president of the Arab world, and the fifth nation of Egypt after the abolition of the Republic nearly 60 years ago.
He took an oath on his seat in front of the court's 18 judges with black beards on the banks of the Nile River, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
During the official ceremony shown on live broadcast on National Television, Morsi said, "We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and another republic."
Muslim Brotherhood, who has spent 84 years as an illegally declared organization since its founding, and who has been on the mark of previous governments, is a U.S.-trained engineer, 60-year-old Morsi, who has been a part of the party.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building and arrived at the small carsâ€™ cabins shortly after 11 a.m., according to local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to congratulate the new President from the time of Mubarak. Traffic was also stopped for a short time, so that the caffeine of his motor would normally remain the same as that of the city.
Brotherhood's non-Christian "empty tyre" has grown considerably in the personal prestige of Morsi, who has been blasted as "empty tyre", and his speech on Friday made him not only an Islamist, but a candidate for all of them.
"""Today, Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern,"" Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, took the oath of office in front of the judges sitting in a wooden panel room.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
After him, Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he had to give his inaugural speech.
The military band was officially welcomed by the national dhun, while they were standing in the currency of caution.
Military Governor Field Marshal Hussain Tantavi was also present.
On their arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university welcomed with the tale that "the army and the people are one hand."
Established in 1908 as a wall of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a wall of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahrir Squair, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's massacre last year, and was removed from his post by the military council, which had been removed from the nation.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court instead of traditionally taking Parliament's capable oath, they leaned in front of the army's will, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
The speech of Morsi in Thahrir Squair was filled with dramatic popular currencies.

Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that in some cases the U.S. spy has crossed the border.
He also claimed that innocent people have not been harassed under the Intelligence Monitoring Program.
Kerry's acceptance came to the fore during the addressing of the annual summit of the Open Government Partnership held in London via video link.
Kerry said I trust you that innocent people are not being abused in this process.
However, in some cases inappropriate methods have been adopted in an attempt to obtain information.
Meanwhile, an important committee of the U.S. Parliament has approved a bill limiting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
Its purpose is to make monitoring more transparent and restore the belief in people who have been hurt by the disclosure of large-scale phone tapes.
The move has been welcomed by six U.S. companies, including Google, Yahoo.
The NSA has also established a partnership in the data centers of these companies.
The Senate's ruling committee passed the Foreign Intelligence Monitoring Amendment Bill (FISA) by 4 votes against 11 on Friday.
This bill mentions a number of restrictions including prohibition of unilateral telephone tapes under the U.S. Patriots Act.
The intentionally unauthorized collection of data under the FISA will be considered a crime and its use will be deemed criminal and a ten-year prison sentence has been provided for it.
The bill will become a law once both the House of Representatives and the Senate have passed the House of Representatives.
The chairman and senator of the committee, Diane Festin, said the NSA's phone recording program is under the law and I believe it has made an important contribution to the security of the country.
However, there needs to be more transparency in this.
This is not to say that the protection of public privacy should also be taken into account.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have been outraged at the unveiling of NSA's Internet Surveillance Program to support the bill.
In a letter to senators, these companies have said that we welcome the proposal of MPs who insist on recording NSA's phones on a large scale.
It is essential that the curtain is removed from the documents issued by former CIA employee Edward Snowden from the duties of the NSA.
Special anger in the international community has been revealed after the NSA's oversight of talks on the phone of the presidents of 35 countries, including Germany and France.

So you thought the travel agent of the last century, would you say thank you to the internet?
The flight center is moving forward with this move.
The company has increased its full-year profit forecast, and is expecting record-breaking profits from Hollywoodmakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company expects that the pre-tax profit will be between <0x24>325 million and <0x24>340 million, compared to <0x24>305 million and <0x24>315 million in previous forecasts.
If the target is achieved according to current guidance, the record earnings in 2011/12 would increase by 12 to 17 per cent in profits of <0x24>290.4 million.
Managing Director Graham Turner said that the flight center has gained 8% profit in the first half, and has made a good start in its second half, especially in Australia and the U.K. non-business trips.
"""So far, our 10 countries are in earnings, and many countries are on track for record-breaking full-year income from interest and tax contributions,"" he said."

A recent media report said that the NSA had flown information from Yahoo and Google's data centers for espionage.
The Washington Post has revealed this on the basis of documents collected from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
According to the report, NSA was the name-master of this program, which he ran alongside his British counterpart-GCQ.
Both agencies have stolen data from Yahoo and Google's massive fiber optic cable networks.
The Washington Post said in the wake of a top secret document dated January 9, 2013 that more than 18 crore documents were collected in just three days of the start of the program.
They also include email, text, audio and video messaging.
According to the Washington Post, the operation was run out of the United States and an anonymous telecom provider helped NSA to make access to this information.
According to the newspaper, it was much easier for NSA to run the program outside the U.S., as there is a need for court orders for such campaigns in the U.S..
NSA Chief General Keith Alexander said, denying these allegations during a press conference in Washington, D.C. - as far as my information is concerned, this has never happened.
The NSA has always collected all information within the scope of the law.
The NSA had recently become a target for the espionage of the German Chancellor.
The United Nations said on Wednesday that the U.S. administration has assured its communications system will not be monitored.

Schools planned to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students must read at least one play of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and the contemporary British story of after 1914.
The exam will also include "unseen text" to encourage more reading.
A joint English Literature and Language Course will be completed.
From 2015, students will have to take a separate G.C.S.E. in the language, and will have a lot of motivation to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new course for English and Mathematics tomorrow - these will be the first two topics in which there will be revolutionary change.
It will also change in other major topics next year.
In a separate step, the exam will show the changes in the structure of the G.C.S.E. with the legal ophthalmology, the new rating system, and the lower course.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gow said that "There was a lot of consensus on the fact that, in order to restore people's confidence, we need to improve our testing system," he added, "GCSE is more challenging, more challenging."
Studies have found that English schools devote less time in mathematics â€“ 116 hours a year or â€“ 3 hours less during a session than most countries.
According to the comparison, Australian Schools provide an average of 143 hours per year to students, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While, there would be no formal requirement to give more time to mathematics, the coalition sources said that broad mathematics was encouraged to provide additional education in schools from being combined with subjects for more weight in the GCSE - League table.
This course will focus more on "real-world problems," including financial mathematics.
The Supreme Court has refused to stop media reporting.
The Supreme Court said it could not tell the media that it would not report on information received from the police or any other source.
Asaram's lawyer said that Asaram is being called Drakula in this case.
There is a guideline for reporting in this case but it is not being followed.
On this, the Supreme Court said, you have many other treatments that you can use.
Asaram's lawyer said there are thousands of news papers and 100 news channels across the country, but there are two channels in particular that make them more difficult.
These people are damaging their image and are reporting unilaterally.
In this case, the right of Asaram should be protected.
The court refused to stop the media from reporting, but told Asaram's lawyer that he has other legal treatments that he can use.
Wind Bensall, who was surrounded by opposition questions at the rail gate, put a spot in the opposition saying that he had not seen a woman in 15 years.
Everyone was surprised to see where the woman's story came from.
Possibly the bansal point was towards a great leader of the BJP and the domestic relations of a parliament.
Turning the case to the other side, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had plotted to put a woman behind him and complained that it had failed during the last parliamentary election.
In a conversation with journalists, Bansal said the CBI had questioned them in the Rail Rishwat.
If they were made a witness in the case, would they be made after the entire examination?
"""The booth scam they're talking about was written a letter to only one person in need,"" Bansal said."
If this is their sin, then they will always be guilty of it.
He said that although the House of Commons did not have the constitutional right to raise the issue, he asked the opposition itself to speak.
He said that as far as the question of telling about development works is concerned, the opposition will be given a list of 15-year development works for this.
The way Chandigarh is evolving or going to be, these people canâ€™t even think about it.
There was an exchange of welcomes between the two at the meeting of the Cabinet.
When the meeting ended, Singh congratulated the Chief Minister for his address to responding to Narendra Modi in the Referendum camp.
He also said about his speech that he had no other sense in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
We need to address the new challenges.
The Chief Minister also had the same feeling on his face that he took Singh's speech in a positive way.
It should be noted that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to respect the workers in the contemplation camp and to protect them from alleged harassment by the officers.
However, they also said that they are also ready for resignation from the Cabinet to keep their talk.
By the way, after the opinion raised in the contemplation camp, there is a fresh outlook in the case of dismissal of the workers in government posts.
JDH President Vashishta Narayan Singh said that the nomination of the workers will be announced soon in 20 Sutri committees.
He also pointed out that the list is almost ready.
It is reported that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will now make a list of his own level.
They will also examine whether the opinions of MLAs have been taken in making the list.
If necessary, the list will be largely altered in order to give place to old and committed workers.
It is common allegation by MLAs and MLAs that they did not take the opinion of those in making the list of Manonion.
The names of those who came from the other parties have been included in the list much later, while many important activists active since the days of the Equality Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spun, some make life ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One of the names of these characters is Dhirubhai Ambani.
The third son of the Gujarat-based Gujarat-based Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani was born on December 28, 1932, as a teacher in a small village of Chorwad, Gujarat.
Dhirubhai was third in five brothers and sisters.
The five children of the family include Ramnikalal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochna and Jasumati.
Due to economic turmoil, Dhirubhai had to quit after high school.
Durhubhai had started to provide financial assistance to the home in his childhood.
At this time they were investing in the Bhajay store near Girnar, the income of the store was limited to the number of tourists who came here.
Speaking of Dhirubhai's first job, he arrived in the city of Aden in 1949 from a ship called Kabota at the age of 17.
Here, his older brother Ramanikalal had made all arrangements for him, so he had no trouble finding a job abroad.
But there was something else going on in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954 they returned to Watanabe.
In 1955, the fortune came to Mumbai with Rs 500 in his pocket.
And that's where his business trip began.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took steps so that he never looked back again.
His name was not only popular in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At the time, he was the owner of Rs 62,000 crore.
His son Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are currently in charge of his Sultanate.
Today, like Father, the names of these two brothers are also prominent among international businessmen.
Who doesn't know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Neta Ambani and Tina Ambani.

Awakening Bureau, Srinagar: Police have allegedly removed the security of former Minister Gulam Hasan Khan, who joined the Congress from the People's Democratic Party.
Khan, who was responsible for the state government, said his security has been removed for political reasons.
Gulaam Hasan Khan, who won the election in 2002 on the PDP ticket from Shopia, was present in his cabinet while serving as Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Said.
Gulam Hasan Khan said that I have been given a security cover since 1996.
I live in the shops that call the terrorists' barracks.
A security axis of the CRPF at my house was deployed under the direction of the inspector.
There are also guards with me, but Verwar has suddenly taken all my safety back.
When the security axis was leaving my house, I spoke to the District Deputy and District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he just said that he would investigate the case.
In this context, when IGP Abdul Ghani of Kashmir was contacted, he denied the information on the case, saying it was a sensitive case.
I will examine for myself how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has finally been removed.
"""I don't have anything in my information,"" said Saifudin Soj, the head of state Congress."
If Hasan Khan's security has been compromised, this is a very serious matter.
I am currently in Jammu and I am coming to Kashmir in the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the relevant administration.
According to the report, over the past four years, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore to celebrate Sardar Patel's birthday.
Instead, during the reign of the NDA (between 1999 and 2004) during the tenure of Atal Vihari Bajpayee's PM, no ads were issued by the government over Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
"""In Gujarat, on Thursday, there was no publicity on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birthdays,"" Modi said, """before this, there was no publicity on the 182-metre tall statue of the Statue of Unity."""
While the DAVP records show that UPA spent Rs. 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs. 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs. 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs. 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's ads.
When asked about Modi's claims, Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Manish Tiwari said the BJP's PM candidate is not speaking on the basis of facts.
The UPA did not receive any ads on Patel in 2008.
Tiwari said that this was due to the economic downturn that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is much lower each year than the amount spent on mortgages and guests of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family.
The DAVP spent Rs 33 crore for Mahatma Gandhi's birthday and birthday, Rs 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawahar Lal Nehru
When Manish Tiwari was asked about this difference, he said, "This should not be seen in terms of spending on advertising.
Because the price of ads depends on a number of things, including the size of the ad or the rate of the ad for that year etc.
The real thing is that it shows our dedication, to which the opponents have tried to handle the legacy of a great leader without going about it.
Today he will meet the families of the people killed in the rally in Patna last Sunday.

Proceeding from the soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Well is providing free health services in rural areas of Cameroon.
Well and his team see hundreds of patients on almost every weekend.
There are not many doctors in West African countries; there is only one doctor for 5,000 people
Send your vote here or send it through the mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for them or anyone else in the top 10 to make CNN a hero of the year.
The winner will receive <0x24>250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father come to mind and unconsciously, going to the hospital, who were not adequately equipped to help him.
Jameel Welle was injured in a car accident near the capital Yundai in Cameroon in 1981.
Initially, his only hand was broken, but an infection increased that spread to his brain, and he made a blood clot, affecting his rest of life.
"There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon," says Georges Well.
If we had money, we would take our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Well was plaguing the crowd of clinics and hospitals with his father and receiving whatever treatment he could get.
"""It's not easy,"" Well said."
You leave the house at 5 a.m. with the hope that you will be the first person to arrive at the hospital, but that doesnâ€™t happen.
There are a lot of patients there.
Some people can wait in the face of death.
There has not been much change in the situation since Well's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
In comparison, there is a doctor for every 413 individuals in the United States.
And if there are doctors there, even many residents of Cameroon can't afford it.
Two in five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the expenditure in health care in the country is private sector.
Well says, "The only problem with them is poverty."
And because of being poor, they canâ€™t enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his compatriots, Well decided to resolve some of it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have undergone 700 free chemotherapy treatments last year.
They also became physicians themselves, and began to work as a vascular surgeon at the Yundee Center Hospital.
And he started the non-profit organization Escowim, which goes to rural areas over the weekend to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted about 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, they and about 30 people sit in the van, tie the medical supplies from the roof, and go to rural areas where people need medical attention.
Sometimes they weren't even lucky.
They have to push the vehicle forward more than once by pushing from the rivers and the soil.
But when they arrive, they really get the respect of the heroes: dance, singing and dancing, and the best housing that can be offered by the community.
Free medical service in these villages is actually a reason to celebrate, and Well - with her big smile and endless energy - includes joy-happy.
The next morning, his team begins to meet hundreds of patients.
"We are meeting 500 people on every trip,"" Well said."
They come about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these clinics offer a variety of different types of medical services over the weekend.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other people can get bassacchi, donated glasses or free birth certificates -- this document is required at school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple chemotherapy with local anesthesia.
The surgery is usually done in a school building, town hall or at home; after the procedure, the patient walks to the recovery site, and makes room for the next person.
The group's generator publishes the sanitation equipment in the operating room, and Well and his volunteers work up and down on Sunday mornings.
It's a wacky pace, but village musicians generally help keep the team inspired.
"They keep playing drums all night to keep us alive and continue their work,"" Well said."
On Sunday, his team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - which includes medical practitioners and foreign medicine students from Cameroon - has 700 free medical treatments in the past year, and they know that their help can change the world of those they help.
One person said that as a result of obtaining free hernia sciatica treatment, he would be able to go back to work again.
The person said, "This will change the future of me and my family."
In addition to running the clinic on the weekends and working as a psychiatrist at the hospital, well at night, they also work in the private medical clinic around Yonde.
He said that this is his second job that finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is filled with private donations.
"""I don't know when they are asleep,"" said Kate O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Wells group."
They are always either in the hospital, or are trying to make money for their organization, so that they continue to run these campaigns.
Students of medicine and nursing such as O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join Well's campaign, this is an experimental opportunity that they can never get in their country.
O'Malley said, "In gin-cell medicine, we are able to help hold tools for Dr. Well or clear blood spots, in which we are able to gain experimental experience."
As a second-year medical student in the United States, you will never have the opportunity to do so.
Volunteer students usually spend their own money to reach Cameroon, and they often come with medical supplies of donations.
But after the arrival of the youth, they come to know their stay, and the expenses of the instructions are well taken.
O'Malley says, "There's no doubt that they're heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon will never end.
Well, for almost the same workload, there is no difficulty.
Helping other people live a happy life, fulfilling their fatherâ€™s promise, these are the things that make them very happy.
Well says, "I'm very happy when I do this work."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.
Take a look at Escowym's website and find out how to help.
You won't be sure, but it's true.

Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government, yet he needs a response from Modi.
It is your duty to respond to the people.

Obama's Healthcare Proposal Has Been Revoked
Amid a drought of criticism, President Obama yesterday took back his often repeated misleading promise: "If you like your health plan, you can keep it going."
As well as receiving notices of dismissal from their providers by millions of people, the Republicans have criticized the president for misleading U.S. citizens in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama changed his true message.
He said in a speech in Boston that "many people who have health insurance, and it's useful, can continue it."
Speaking about the dismissal he calls the "news buzz," Obama has graced to buy new coverage in the market from U.S. citizens who receive this information.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, just as much as money or a comprehensive health care plan cheaper than the proposed.
"""You will find a better deal,"" he said."
The administration has said it should not be surprising that 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance with their own money may be obliged to change their plans because their coverage is not in conformity with the standards required under the Portable Care Act.
In a statement before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Vancouver, Sebelius said, "I'm telling these American citizens directly 'You're entitled to a better one.'
Sebelius, who is taking responsibility for the implementation of the Portable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market has been "unlucky" since October.
"""I am as disappointed and angry as other people,"" he said."
I want to get your trust again.

Unexpectedly, John Kerry said the U.S. spy "has gone far ahead inappropriately."
John Kerry has pointed out that the U.S.'s protective attitude on his surveillance program has softened by accepting it unexpectedly that sometimes its spy "goes far ahead inappropriately."
The State Minister has also admitted that he is also with Barack Obama in the case of being on "automated pilot" as a rebel revelation to spokesman Edward Snowden about coming to the forefront of NSA's espionage activities.
This mystery has brought the U.S. government into a cohesive gesture in its relations with its partner countries.
Speaking through video link at the Free Government Conference in London9/, Mr. Kerry said: "There is no question that the President, me, and others in the government really knew about some of the things that were going to happen with automatic pilots, such as war, war, war, etc., etc.
They have become the first high-ranking members of the U.S. government, who have admitted that the U.S. spies have extended their borders, but have stressed that no one's rights have been abused.
"In some cases, it has gone a long way inappropriately,"" he said."
And the President is determined to try to clarify this for the people and is currently undergoing intensive review so that no one feels abused.
I assure you that there is nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry stressed that, however, NSA was an effort for good purpose, and its monitoring work has saved the lives of many people.
"""We are facing a world where people are ready to fly themselves,"" he added."
There is a violent uprising in the world, committed to blasting them to kill people and attacking governments.
So if you're able to stop it before it happens, what's the problem?
We have actually saved the plane from crashes, the demolition of buildings, and the killing of people because we are able to know about othersâ€™ plans in advance.
During this, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers would be forced to go to Europe to understand the need for U.S. taxpayers to help resolve concerns overseas about the so-called U.S. espionage, and the U.S. to understand the need for taxpayers.
Connecticut senator Chris Murphy said he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and has been involved in anti-terrorism organizations because of the bribery caused by the National Security Agency.
"In an interview with Washington, the president of the Senate for European Affairs and the Democratic Party, who was first elected, said, ""In the interests of the U.S. National Security, it is really important to us that our terrorists are terrorists.""
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA program.
The news of recording Europe's millions of phone conversations by NSA has brought a slight slight slip in relations with some of the U.S. partners, although the head of the agency said that the news was not entirely accurate, even though the same was not the case with Sahat Mehta and the NATO allies.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden appear to have shown that the NSA has monitored the phones of 34 other top leaders in the world, including German Chancellor Agency Markle.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper, defending the incident of spying on allied countries, called it necessary and said it is common for both sides to do so.
In the meantime, Murphy said his office is arranging a Congress trip that is likely to take place this year, and he hoped that both parties and members of the Chambers will join the House of Representatives.
Names of other participating method-makers will be released in the coming days.
He said that the travel program is still being worked on.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said that some "non-practical relations" would also have to be abandoned.
"European leaders will also have to be honest with their people, their spying programs that have been used for years," he said.
"While we can amend our monitoring program to better protect the rights of the European people, but they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy said.
During this, this weekend, Mr. Carrieâ€™s program is to go to the Middle East and Poland, where they will solve the mystery of U.S. surveillance activities, from the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran.
A new policy of changing boards in municipalities has begun.
Recently, the board of Congress-led Sahithia Municipality of Virbhum district changed to the board of Trinamul as a result of a change of party of Congress-led parishes.
The change was due to the inclusion in the trinamools of most congressional constituencies, including the chairman of the municipality.
Not only the Congress, but some of the Bhakti, Bhakti and Farward Blocks have also taken over the repression of Trinamul here.
Trinamool Congress Secretary-General Mukul Rai says it is a good sign for the party.
He said that Sakithiya Municipality chairman Virender Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Datta were among the 10 congressional constituencies in Trinamul.
Some of the left-wing MPs, including Macpa, have also stamped the Trinamul flag.
All have written to the District Attorney under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of Trinamul and, according to the number of forces, the Sahithia Municipality Board has also come under control of Trinamul.
Shri Rai also claims that all agree that the development of Bengal has been decided under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties including Congress, Macpa, Bhakpa, and Farward Block are moving forward to join the Trinamul Congress.
Welcome to the trinity of eligible leaders of any party.
The occupancy of Trinamul on the board of the municipality is seen as important in political circles due to changes in the party of Congress makers in the Sahithya Municipality before the election of the five municipalities on November 22.
It is also an example of occupying Trinamool on the Congress-run Palika Board in Haldia and Rivera, governed by the Legislative Assembly.
When Trinamool is occupied on the board of the municipality in the districts, those who join the party are welcomed to the Trinamool Bhavan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress Secretary-General Mukul Rai is excited to join the Trinamool of the leaders by breaking up with other parties.
"""Welcome to the trinity of those who come out of any party,"" he said."
He claims that the confidence of the people under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is increasing, resulting in people wanting to join Trinamul.
However, the main opposition party, the Macpa, has said that the lower-level leaders of other parties are being intimidated.
People fearing the terror of the Trinamool Congress are joining it.
The change in the board of elected local bodies has been seen as a tragedy for the Macpa democracy.
Any party has the right to increase its presidency in a democratic way, but it is reasonable to question the legitimacy of not making a change in power.
An Australian woman appealed against the Thai jail term.
A 21-year-old Sidney woman has been sentenced to 15 days in prison in the Fuket for allegedly assaulting a taxi driver, she has appealed against the decision and has been granted bail.
On June 15, the Fucket Provincial Court found Steve Rochelle Bombard guilty of misrepresenting the Thai police, alleging that on Sunday morning, June 10, a local taxi driver had tried to stop him along with two other persons.
But the C.C.T.V. footage later revealed that he had returned to the hotel safely after separating from his Australian boyfriend.
He was told the story by the Fuket police during a two-day interrogation of Bamfort.
He was placed in the local police station before the hearing in the court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low security precautionary centre in the outskirts of Fuket instead of incarceration for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has applied to help his daughter from the Foreign Affairs Department in Canberra.
Tonks told Sydney's Sande Telegraph that the whole family is "very worried" about the care of his daughter and they want to call her back to Australia.
"""Certainly this has been a worrying time for us, but we hope that he will be back home soon."
Bamphod has appealed against the sanction order, and a bail has been obtained on 50,000 baht.
During this time, a report in Australia said he was celebrating holidays at the place to celebrate the crab holiday in southern Thailand.
Legal sources based in Thailand said Bambford's case was being fought by a local lawyer in the Fucket, but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court could extend his sentence by up to two years and imprison him as an adult.
After the recent assassination of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in the footage, Thailand may also be blamed for attempting to improve its bad tourist image.
