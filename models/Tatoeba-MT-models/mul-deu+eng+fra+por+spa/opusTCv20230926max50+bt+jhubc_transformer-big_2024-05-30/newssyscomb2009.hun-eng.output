Left-wing populists win in Austria, they have a total of 29 percent
The weakening of the two major coalition parties so far and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties, according to the first preliminary results of the Austrian parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The Austrian People’s Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer was seriously affected, suffered a particularly strong loss.
On the other hand, the President of the Federation for the Future of Austria, the provincial leader of Karintia, Jörg Haider, is preparing to return victoriously to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the country's strongest party is the Social Democratic Party (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it lost 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last 2006 elections.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP was even worse, with 25.6 percent losing nearly nine percent of the vote.
These are the worst results of both major parties in the history of post-war Austria, and the result is literally disastrous in the People's Party, which has led to the elections in advance.
At the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the People's Party had a significant advantage before the SP<0xC3><0x96>, according to public opinion surveys.
The voters, however, were apparently punished for letting the government fall.
In the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of party chairman Wilhelm Molterer and current chancellor.
Observers believe that this will take place on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the party presidency.
This development is likely to facilitate an increasingly likely way out of the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SPO and <0xC3><0x96>VP major coalition.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties – the Austrian Liberty Party (FP<0xC3><0x96>) and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> – it was 18 percent of the votes in advance, and 11 percent of the votes in the polls in 2005, but the social democrats were in the same period.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party, and I assume that he can return to national politics in Vienna, is obviously looking forward to this solution.
The Green Party, however, has lost some popularity in the parliament, and has fallen from third to fifth among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties crossed the 4% threshold and did not go to parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships in India could cool down
If we fail to resolve the problem of the Czech scientists who have reported illegal civic gatherings, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said there could be some defiance in Czech-Indian relations.
The minister announced this after a meeting in New York with Pranab Mukherjee, his Indian partner, today.
"If this were not resolved, then yes, there would be some trust," he said after the meeting, which was conducted by Czech encouragement.
After the trial, Mukherjee said that it was difficult for the executive to intervene in court cases.
However, he pointed out that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was dismissed and fined, the central government may negotiate with the local leadership in Darjeeling, whose legality the case is subject to.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, however, Mukherjee said it would be best if he appealed to the Supreme Court.
Then you could ask for a free placement against custody and you could wait for the verdict, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself similarly during the trial as well.
"He recommended an appeal to the former court, so it would be possible to release him," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole case is to provide the convict with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side has already provided such assistance to them.
"It is in our greatest interest to preserve the best relationship with India with many years of tradition.
The Indians recognize this as well,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of the Czech entomologists.
"In fact, we consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a serious mistake," he said.
To the question of whether the Indian side had received a promise to deal with the matter, the minister gave the answer.
"I've got a lot of promises already," he said.
Czech judges continue to fight for the seabeds
Go to the wall electronic map, where you can see Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, it is not a matter of land, but of a missing point in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with its neighboring seabeds.
In the meantime, the area is as big as the continent itself," said Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of the UN Division's 30th Working Group on Ocean and Maritime Affairs.
His boss, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, the director of the division, monitors the explanation, which he sometimes adds.
Emotion and enthusiasm reign here.
The seafloor is rich in natural resources, hiding a world that is barely known to date.
Oil, arch and other minerals are found here, but also unknown living organisms, which can be the key to the development of a cancer medicine, for example.
Larger seabeds than dry land
The coastal states are currently intensively applying for new submarine areas.
According to the UN Convention, they exercise their rights, which were enshrined in Jamaica’s Montego Bay in 1982.
It is primarily the territory of the so-called continental shelf, which often stretches up to a few hundred kilometers from the shores of the country.
According to the Convention, such a country has the exclusive right to all sources of the Continental Foundation.
"Simplified, we hold the part and bottom of the seabed of the continental shelf, which is a natural continuation of the undersea land.
The coastal sea borders, often 200 nautical miles, extend beyond the so-called exclusively economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by the country to the Committee for the Designation of the External Borders of the Continental Fund shall be supplemented by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly research and measurements.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the committee.
The Committee has so far negotiated five requests: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
Australia’s recent success in the world was the first to significantly expand its undersea country.
But New Zealand has also won - the area of seabed that the Commission has assigned to it is about 1.6 million square kilometres, which is six times the size of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits resulting from the future use of the seafloor are expected to be invaluable.
Other countries are also continuously submitting their applications.
They can do so within ten years from the date of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental foundation ends, the area of the ocean floors declared by the Convention as a "common heritage of humanity" begins.
None of the countries here have a unique situation.
The right to production in this area shall be conferred by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seafloors, however, are not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, adding that "some of their territories were legally clearly enclosed and their regime was established in a treaty."
Czech Republic in the Pacific Ocean
Some of the ocean floors are now part of the Czech Republic.
This former Eastern bloc is shared with other countries within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
Under the Convention, this organization received the so-called "pioneer investor" status in 1991, like some other countries' investors.
It is eligible to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area reviewed by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, a kind of undersea copy of the Tatra.
"This total area of 75,000 square kilometres can be produced.
The area is a rich location for polymetallic archs containing nickel, cast iron, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, co-worker of the division in Macedonia, presents another concrete example.
It reminds me of a potato, or a little bit of fantasy, of a parchment with magic words that give life to Golem.
German special forces were present at the liberation of hostages
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - and the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
The release of 11 European tourists abducted in Egypt is becoming more and more detailed.
The rescue operation was also indirectly carried out by German special forces, according to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior.
In addition to the specialists of the German Federal Army, the GSG 9, the airline of the German Federal Police, the employees of the Federal Criminal Office, and the logistics experts of the German Technical Service, the release of the space.
According to ministry spokesmen on Monday evening, however, the German forces were not needed, as the hostages were allowed to run their prisoners and then fled when they recognized the signs of the violent hostage.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany in order to engage it as a supportive force on the ground.
"Unfortunately, this has not happened," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers kidnapped tourist groups from five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts in southern Egypt on September 19.
After the kidnappings in the desert area of southern Egypt, hostages on the borders of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad were pushed back and forth.
The appearance of the hostages has remained unclear so far, as well as details of the release of the hostages or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the survivors arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the liberated hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
The details of the release have not been disclosed.
In Berlin, no information has been provided on when they will return to Germany.
According to the daily "Bild", the five tourists and special forces will arrive in Germany on Tuesday on Airbus aircraft of the German Air Force.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the emergency package.
The lower house of the U.S. Congress has dropped a <0x24>700 billion bailout package for the money markets by a small majority.
A Dow Jones went deeper.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for the money markets by 227 votes to 206 against.
Despite the calls of US President George W. Bush and the leaders of both parties, he was not given a majority of the program to curb the chaos in the money markets.
The supporters have desperately tried to convince critics of the need for a <0x24>700 billion package during a dramatic move.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic party's negotiators, called on MPs to support the plan, even if the party's plan is unpopular.
"It's hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn't even happened," he said.
The Dow Jones lost more than 6 percent or 600 points during the vote.
Investors were concerned that the state-run bailout could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote, to then fall again after a failure to make it public.
Experts expect further serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
Approval by both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required to enter into force.
Directors are registering more and more bookings.
A good winter is promised to the German tour operators.
According to one study, the turnover of travel bookings for the next few months increased significantly compared to the previous year – more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the Germans’ travel favor did not go well according to the study.
For winter bookings, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in traffic compared to the previous year's period, the German Travel Association (DRV) said on Monday in Berlin.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Guide Institute, the number of bookings for the autumn months is also higher.
Travel agencies' turnover in October exceeded 11% in October 2007, DRV said.
These results are based on data from the GfK, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1,200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates it to the entire market.
The Institute took into account the trips booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the U.S. was especially sought, the DRV said.
The number of bookings has increased by one-third.
Germany’s most popular destinations are Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic landscapes.
Most of the organised paths were sought, said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
Due to rising energy and food costs, for organized trips, the costs "are better calculated for passengers than for individually organized trips."
Passengers can save money with pre-booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple added.
The booking rate for the summer months was also very good, so traffic growth could be recorded again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, fewer German tourists undertook a trip compared to the previous year.
The first Oktoberfest
Uninterrupted repetitive ballermann beats, literal chords and design-carrying celebrities.
Debut in Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I are not much like each other.
She's blonde, she's a TV host, and she's wearing a customized jersey.
My hair is dark, I'm a student, and I bought my clothes in the turquoise.
But there is one thing that connects us: we are only three minutes away from Wiesn, and the photographers are already beating us up and filling their memory cards - very delightful, and all this on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how we can make friends.
Looks like the inexpensive annoyance is enough for your destination.
As a tourist living in Wiesn to the north of the equator made of white steak, my sense of comfort is still limited by the popular leadership.
But when it comes to Theresienwies, it's not that bad anymore.
Almost everyone wears a scarf or a pants; no one looks shy or embarrassed - everything is perfectly fine.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand are just my furry tie.
A woman in Munich draws my attention to the fact that I mistook the ribbon: "You're bound to the left, you're free, you're a midwife, you're right, you're a widow in the back."
Secretly, I switched the mast from the back to the left.
"That's good," she says, and laughs.
Others get less shaved around the subtle flirting techniques, and wear a simple sheet of foil with the inscription "I'm too drunk to dress up" and show off their naked backs.
The young man, Bob, who shows the exhibitionist traits, also visited the Oktoberfest for the first time.
What you find very fantastic, extending the "aaaaa" for a long time.
He then tells me that he's got rid of the contents of his previously consumed crust.
Right next to one of the fire pits, which everyone sees as rubbish.
So, Bob is one of the famous "tild runners."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, the ambulances walk through the site and take care of the poor couples.
Patient caregivers always appear in teams - four shoes at the same time from tent to tent a covered rod.
This works just like most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure bulky.
It doesn't seem like he's lying in a bottle of alcohol under the pony.
"These are the ones who are completely ready," one saint shouted to me at my question, and then in a twist.
Police have named the victim of the accident.
Police have named the 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, crashed on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
He was transported to the Queen's Hospital in Rome, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
Since then, he has been released with caution.
Turkey's Expanding Diplomatic Horizon
Long before Turkey’s intention to join the European Union, the European powers were keen on the desire to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, stands one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial aspiration.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed in the Neo-Renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the guidebooks say.
The building surrounds the end of the towers, with one tower at each front corner, and looks like some kind of German country house.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little confused.
However, in view of the interior of the shopping mall, it is clear what large-scale enterprise this was the westernmost gateway.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the “late future” of the conquests from Damascus through Baghdad, wanted to achieve its ambitions for the occupation of the Middle East with the help of the railway leading today to Saudi Arabia.
The German conquest attempts collapsed during World War I.
The railway lines were attacked by the Arab Lawrence and Arab partisans.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The British colonial army retreated from Egypt and expelled the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha Station hasn't been better.
In 1917, a bullet train exploded and destroyed the building's well-developed top.
According to Turkish sources, a sabotage action took place.
Since then, it has slowly collapsed, and the history has been well overwhelming.
At the same time today, as a railway gateway to Anatolia and the entire eastern region - at least in a symbolic sense - Turkey serves as an expanding diplomatic horizon.
The ruling Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has developed an entirely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The new policy is a metal sign of commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, Hamas and Fatah Palestinian groups, Iraq, Iran, as well as, of course, the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I took the night train to Ankara, the Turkish capital, to visit one of the ACP’s leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish parliamentarian Suat Kiniklioglut.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of eclipse, which also gave the rhythm of the famous documentary about the old world, "The Night Mail" - I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city was dedicated to the symbol of the new secular state.
However, the AKP, which has well-known Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This raised some suspicions in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern building made of stone and steel, specifically for this purpose - which is located in a developing suburban district, half-finished shopping malls and coffee shops. The latter will meet with an audience in the middle of the night.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have been a middle-right politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a dress, a collar, and I'm sure he had another Blackberry.
“The party’s foreign policy goal is to help Turkey’s reintegration into its immediate environment.
The Cold War has upset the order," he said.
Turkey is isolated from the back.
He had to go east and west at the same time.
He couldn't choose between the two.
He had to open it in both directions.
"But is it possible that he will be forced to vote sooner or later?" I asked.
"Turkey has never wanted to face an answer."
Afterwards, he stressed that almost all of the people I have spoken to here almost automatically repeated: Turkey's relations with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea, are of the same benefit to Europe and the United States.
It is as if they would like to convey the message that - in a sense - together with Turkey, the whole of Europe can be reached on those eastward railroads to Asia and the Middle East.
When I was back at Hydarpasha station, after another night I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who were watching the reconstruction of this decorative building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe’s Middle Eastern ambitions are now largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I waited in the harbor for the compass to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that at that time Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe."
At the time, there was at least no question about which part of the land would hold the demand for this exciting country.
Memorable Life: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown wrote: Since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley, as Guildford's music director, has been leading the Guildford Philharmonic Chart and Choir.
Based on his musical plans for the city, he founded the following year a wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They could only have been under 21 years of age, but when Proteus sang the finale in 1979 - many of us were already at the end of our 20s - we simply weren't willing to separate from the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shape changer) was consistent with the choir's resilience and ability to deal with any bag they put in front of - be it the madrigal, or a piece of a messiaen; without accompaniment, or a great musician.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astounding and always exciting, and we could thank the person whose inspiration for our enthusiasm for music remained unchanged over the years.
How often did Tod tell us, "Let's let the music speak on its own."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the bag.
“Sing it!”
“Karmester’s technique was always completely understandable and accurate, but never dictatorial or excessive.
No matter what the music level was, he was always up on it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about it:
If there was ever a wrist driver who was supposed to be a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I met him well in the two decades during which he led the Guildford Philharmonics from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past forty years, I’ve written criticisms of more than 100 concerts, but it never disappointed me, and often excited me with them.
Tod Handley had greatness and modesty, which is very rare.
He hated those wrestlers who - living in his words - simply "have galoped with one or two well-known fighters all over the world."
Many of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
William Woodruff (September 25) said: "In 1946 he continued his studies in economic history in Oxford, and in 1950 he became a scholarship to the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while he was continuously preparing for his undergraduate, master's degree and diploma."
This comes from the author's notes of Woodruff's work "Beyond Nab End", but is wrong.
From 1946 to 1953, he taught economics at the University of Nottingham, while under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers, he completed his PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, which he later published in 1958 as "The British rubber industry".
In 1950-51 he actually stayed in the United States with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It's impossible to know why Woodruff built up his career in this period.
J. Vicente Resino at the Bálcséskaron
"I recommend J. Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco and Life" because his photographs in black and white, documentary style are fascinating.
The simplicity and strength that flowed from them, as well as respect for the people in the photographs, attracted their attention.
This exhibition is influenced by emotions.
He has come to the rescue of the magical moments.”
For the second time, sales record at Honda
In November, Honda will launch the second-generation Jazz.
True, his predecessor already had a large passenger compartment, but the interior design of the new model is even more spacious.
All of this is coupled with sophisticated mechanics, which makes driving more convenient and increases fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is what the second-generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although the new Jazz scene is very similar to its predecessor, many internal changes have been made to it.
These include, for example, innovative design, the new body, larger sizes and new mechanics.
But before we move on to a detailed description of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz was released six years after the first generation was launched.
So, for the first time, we can conclude that Honda has succeeded in renewing this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Jazz is less known in Europe, but it sets sales records in other markets.
Such a market, for example, in Japan, where Jazz was the most sought after car brand in 2002 and 2008.
In Japan, for example, nearly a million pieces of Jazz have been sold since their release.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million copies sold in six years.
However, Honda wants to continue to increase traffic in the area with the new Jazz.
In 2007, the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazzes, with an estimated 100,000 car sales targeted in 2009, resulting in a 17% increase in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8000 units of Jazz since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the head of the Spanish subsidiary is estimated to be 2000 copies sold in the course of a year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly ease the decline of Honda’s sales in Spain.
The company’s representatives predict 22,000 copies sold by the end of the year, which is less than 4,000 compared to the 2007 data, which is a 16% decrease.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which rose from 1.6% last year to 1.8%.
I would also like to increase this ratio to 2% by 2010.
Honda expects this to be achieved with the introduction of a new model.
This would be the Insight, a five-stroke and compact size - 4,370 mm long - hybrid, of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 units annually worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight’s market share would be made by the United States, while the remaining half would be split between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight will take place in the first months of the year, following the official Valencian presentation scheduled for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become wider in all respects.
Its length reaches 3900 mm (five centimeters longer), its width 1690 mm (two centimeters wider) and its axle distance increased by five centimeters, i.e. 2500 mm.
In contrast, the height is unchanged 1520 mm.
In addition to the sizes, the passenger space has also become wider.
The larger interior is guaranteed, on the one hand, by the new body and the fuel tank in the middle - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the so-called double-floor luggage storage unit has grown, currently 399 litres, i.e. exceeding the capacity of the first generation by 19 litres.
Although this includes the sizes mentioned for the type with the 1.4 engine, the 1.2 Honda Jazz has a luggage capacity of 379 liters.
Some external modifications can also be discovered, such as rear led lamps or optional panoramic glazing, as well as easier accessibility of rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the rear-seat doors was raised to 80 degrees, compared to the opening angle of the first Jazz 67 degrees.
The second-generation Jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of its sale, this small model can be ordered with two, 1.2 and 1.4 litre drives.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, both power consumption is more favourable than the previous model, as well as lower carbon emissions and excellent mechanical coherence, while the engine delivers superior performance in all respects.
The 1.2-liter power supply has 90 horsepower at 6000 rpm and a maximum pressure factor of 114 Nm at 4900 rpm.
This engine - which was 78 hp in the previous Jazz - consumes 5.3 liters and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
The other engine, which produced 83 hp of the previous generation, now reaches 100 hp.
The 100 horsepower 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
The "conflict avoiding"
To develop accident-prevention technologies, this time Nissan is inspired by a new invention from nature, precisely from the world of bees.
The Japanese company has designed a robot that avoids accidents by imitating beehives.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step in developing collision-prevention technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center, in collaboration with the University of Tokyo Advanced Scientific and Technological Research Center, have built this small robot in Japan.
According to Kazuhhiro Doi, Director of Technology PR and Research Development, the BR23C is an extension of Nissan’s four-level safety bucket.
The robot enhances the ability of the company’s products to avoid collisions.
During flight, each bee forms its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety cap.
However, much more important is the role of the complex eye of the uterus, with which it sees at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions. As a result, the uterus can fly smoothly in its own personal space.
To copy the function of the complex eye, engineers designed a so-called laser range finder (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument identifies obstacles within a distance of up to 2 meters in 180 degrees before the BR23C, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns into a collision avoidance operation.
"As soon as the obstacle is detected, the small robot immediately changes direction after the movements of the bee by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle in order to avoid collision.
The system is most distinguished from the currently available instruments, in which case the avoidance maneuver is completely automatic.
If it weren’t, the robot wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the maneuvering maneuver cannot be directed upwards or downwards, nor can it move in two dimensions, and only in the direction of the rotation of the wheels, that is, not in an infinite direction and way, as is the case with bees.
That’s why in the robot, Nissan has also used a rotational function in addition to acceleration and slowdown to avoid collisions.
"This structure only needs to process and respond to the data every few seconds.
There is no need for data storage, nor for an intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvres, so you can work with just a few dozen KB of memory without interruption.
This may sound surprising, but it’s not really a gigabyte, but we’re not even talking about megabytes of memory.
This is the first step towards developing an instant collision prevention technology that, according to Nissan’s estimates, could be incorporated into series-produced cars within ten years.
The robot operates with lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, further application may be possible to integrate the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to deliver the car to the destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Afraid of a mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Mining Department, in addition to having a lot of cash to invest, doesn't make any sense.
With the crisis on their necks, and the Americans not to be questionable about bankruptcies, they have created a fun and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
This is the "Wrong Loan Hotel"... that's for the Galicians.
The picture of the accommodation, and especially the reception hall, suggests that we should think again, twice, or rather three times, if the time of borrowing has actually just come.
And most importantly, where to apply for a loan, because this is probably the purpose of the thing.
The information on the website is really useful, but not detailed.
It's more for the public than for the public.
But what would happen if we supplemented the game?
For example, the room of our dreams in the hotel.
Actually, it's also something, because we don't dare to dream about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley Opens Capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that it will provide a share of its capital to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay <0x24>9 billion for 21% of the company's capital after the Morgan Stanley stock exchange has fallen sharply.
A week after the preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks said that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s shares at a unit price of <0x24>25.25, for a total of <0x24>3 billion.
The accepted price will remain more than 19% off the value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional <0x24>6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which will provide a 10% return and a <0x24>31.25 exchange rate.
According to Morgan Stanley, when executing the global transaction, the average exchange rate is based on <0x24>29, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock price fell by 6.79 percent around 17 hours in the middle of Greenwich, closing at <0x24>23.07.
“This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to accelerate the transformation into a bankholding company,” said John Mack, CEO of the U.S. group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week to diversify its activities while at the same time being controlled by the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with the MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even more caution from the firms listed on Wall Street.
The terms announced on Monday also show that the agreement was amended in the last few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about <0x24>8.5 billion.
“A week ago, we thought that the share would be entirely stockpiles,” said Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG’s chief executive officer in Tokyo.
“However, due to the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and protect potential risks.”
In terms of the weighted average price, the MUFG pays 7% more than the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return on a stock decreases by about 20%.
Under the agreement, the MUFG may convert half of its preferential shares in one year to stocks if the exchange rate of the latter exceeds the exchange rate of change by more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. around <0x24>47.
In this way, Morgan Stanley ensures that with the help of funds from MUFG, you can leverage your investment opportunities, improve your balance sheet, and increase your liquid resources.
However, the group's spokesperson did not want to provide accurate information on the strategic plans of the two new Allies.
After joining MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I payability rate by about 15%, making it one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan said the balance had "decisively improved" since the end of August.
Over the past few weeks, the group has experienced a great deal of effort, as the price of its shares has fallen by half, while the cost of insurance against non-payment risk has fallen to the skies.
This cost decreased on Monday, but remained at a high level of around 12%.
One of the major investor banks remains a "survivor" after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. This is Goldman Sachs, who announced last week that it had reached <0x24>15 billion in buffalo from Warmaa to Bertshire.
Rafael Correa's Monday statement, Quito
The restructuring of the republic in the spirit of 21st century socialism.
This is a joint plan for Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Following the example of his colleagues and friends, Correa expressed his views on the new constitution on Sunday.
His mission was successful, as 64% of the voters voted yes in the referendum according to the official results, which covered 80% of the votes.
According to the polls, 28% of the population voted no, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% of the voters voted incompletely.
The draft constitution required 50% <0x2B> 1 vote to be adopted.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations and a billing by a civil organization showed a huge surplus of the "yes" votes at 63% and 70% respectively.
Rafael Correa, by the way, had already talked about the victory of his constitutional draft on Monday night.
"The constitution has won a tremendous victory," he said, and thanked the Ecuadorians in Guayaquil, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
As well as the well-known Rafael Correa, Chávez, Morales and the President of Chile, Michelle Bachelet congratulated.
According to a report by the Observatory Mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), the vote took place in a calm atmosphere, the main theme of which was a 444-point text, which summarized the principles of "new socialism" protected by the president.
The proposed constitution puts state power at the service of the economy, preserving the state's right to "plan development" for a country that lives mainly from oil production by foreign companies and from the currency sent by immigrants.
Correa's 2006 draft constitution also confirms the power of the head of state, who can hold a mandate for up to two consecutive periods and is eligible to disassociate the national assembly.
Correa has already announced that he wants to live with this opportunity, and in February 2009 he will be competing again for the mandate of the head of state.
The Constitution also includes the free access to health services and education. The President has already started introducing it in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population lives below the minimum.
And finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could end the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian facility on which anti-drug measures are based.
19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando hit the kidnappers, who had been taking hostage for ten days, with eleven tourists and their eight companions.
The hostages are now staying in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were detained for ten days in the desert, from which they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were liberated in the morning by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, around four o’clock in the afternoon, they arrived by plane at al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to Cairo’s international airport.
The hostages were forbidden to declare to the press and immediately transferred to a hospital in the suburban district of Maadi, Cairo, where they were inspected.
The hostages were "healthy" and the kidnappers "didn't pay a ransom" at the airport, Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna said.
The hostages were captured on September 19 at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border areas of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they participated in a field safari, and the group was then driven from one hiding place by 35 unknown hostages to another.
There were 11 tourists in the group (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman), as well as eight Egyptians: two tourist guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian travel agency organising the safari.
According to an Egyptian security official, a 30-man special commando arrived on two helicopters at the scene, where they were hit by the hostages just before the raid.
"There was a firefight among the troops, half of the kidnappers were killed and the rest escaped," the leader said.
He also said a total of 150 special forces were sent from the Egyptian Blitz Brigade to Sudan, where German and Italian commandos were added.
The Italian diplomatic leader in Belgrade, Franco Frattini, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We have to recognize that we could not have achieved this result without the professional and effective intervention of our secret service personnel and action groups," he said in a statement.
He also refused to pay a ransom for the hostages.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army announced that a field vehicle was detained during a patrol raid on which the kidnappers were travelling, killing six of them (including the chassis leader) and arresting two others.
The military said the hostages were in contact with a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the organization immediately rejected.
Lettres - The "silent majority" of culture
The focus of the press and the current election campaign is currently on the financing of culture.
All we can do is enjoy it.
But they continue to forget a slice of our cultural life.
Who is going to raise his word to highlight the ridiculous amounts of small museums, libraries, archaeological excavations, and national historical sites that are on the brink of starvation?
Which politician deserves to remind the federal government that it does not care about its monuments and buildings that are part of the cultural heritage?
Or is it that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that really ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government has spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley alone?
The Constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, all elected representatives and all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, a company dealing with 211 history, cultural heritage, collection and genealogy, more than 40,000 volunteers work on the research of history, the arts, the arts, and the great arts.
Often these organizations are protecting our heritage with their fingertips and protesting with their last strength when real estate developers and decision makers direct their bulldozers to our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will anyone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Statement of a part of Fortis bank by Benelux governments
The Benelux states will be assisted by partial nationalisation by the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortison, which was the first in Europe to be in trouble due to the impact of the US credit market crisis: the three countries provide a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion to Hungary’s interests and reserves.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments negotiated the matter at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's Competition Officer.
In the euro area, Fortis Bank is the first major crisis in the waves in the context of the international monetary crisis that has been ringing for more than a year, and the decisions taken in the bank’s case can therefore be considered to be precedent in some respects.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states are buying the bank’s existing assets in nearly half (49 percent).
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including the activities acquired last year by the Dutch ABN Amró – mainly its insurance company.
Fortis’s shares began to fall sharply last week, and in the second half of the week there were already serious crises at the institute.
However, analysts agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The company's papers fell by about 12 percent on Friday, at the age of 14.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
In terms of current stock prices, the group’s total market capital is around EUR 14 billion, but according to company managers, this is not realistic.
The company’s management has caused overseas market uncertainties regarding the <0x24>700 billion U.S. package plan to fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers were slightly up.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx appointed a new CEO to the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but no one has applied for a worthwhile offer so far.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry, they do not lose money.
There was no panic among the bank’s clients so far, the accounts were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has an independent account and has also purchased leasing companies.
Rock in the Chicken
In the United States, life and health insurers often refuse to enter into an insurance contract with the applicant based on people’s drug purchase data.
Data protection professionals fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that binds the use of pharmacovigilance data in all cases to the consent of the data subject.
It must be independently in the hands of the fox, otherwise we will trust the chicken school," said Richard Dicket, the developer of the Washington Post's drug-recipient program.
Insurers shall depend on the health status of the applicant's client on the amount of the insurance fee and in the event of damages, and if they consider the risk to be too high, they shall not be insured with it.
A long time ago, the person was sent to a medical examination and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the outcome of the examination.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: from pharmacy stores, based on the identification number of the client, he easily buys what drugs he has bought in the last year and a half, and from this program he himself results in what kind of disease he is.
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol lowering, it suggests that your blood fat levels are practically impossible to manage, which immediately classifies them as a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of which also define a risk multiplication number, so the insurer has little to do outside of paperwork, even though small difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that some medicines can be used for multiple purposes, for example, some compounds can be used against migraines or heatwaves, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is considered a significant risk-increasing factor for business insurers, not the former.
Separate companies have been established to collect and process the data, and they, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacy, ask for the patient’s consent.
They are now obliged to do so by the authorities, although no penalty has been imposed for their negligence so far.
Some companies have recently been processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them to data on drug consumption, so that they can provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and it is becoming more and more difficult to control their use.
There is a separate health data protection law, but it only applies to healthcare providers and insurers.
Before the congress, there is a bill that also gives the authorities control over companies specializing in the provision of data.
Dick Richard understands that this is not enough: he therefore developed his program, which would bind the transmission of data to the express consent of the data subject.
The other question is that the person concerned cannot refuse the contribution, otherwise the insurers will not enter into a contract with him.
Thus, however, the chickens are still referred to as the good fortune of the frog.
Global diners in Marseille
Doubles trade between the European Union and India
As the leading trade partners of the European Union and India, the agenda of the ninth summit was also governed by this topic, along with the rest, largely global problem.
Today there will also be a French-Indian summit, where it will be mainly about nuclear cooperation.
The European Union recognizes that India is a rising democratic power, which should have a greater influence on international affairs, but the member states have not yet managed to reach a common denominator, whether they support New Delhi's permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This issue has not yet been raised at the 9th summit in Marseille, which was held yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the EU's serial president, and Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Foreign Representative Javier Solana welcomed the Prime Minister of India Manmohan Szingh, with whom they also agreed that in five years he would double his share of money, i.e.
Given the fact that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
In this context, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements in force with India have been summarised in a legal sense, i.e., air traffic may also have wings in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance India’s EU trade partner number one, while New Delhi is only ninth in the ranks of EU partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, has been condemned in all its forms and urgently called for a UN conference.
The end of the Doha trade round was also called for, although both of them have a large share of the failure to date.
The EU has confirmed that, in addition to its sustainable energy and climate programme, it wants to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed that the climate conference for the future should be a global deal, and that the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 50 percent by 2050.
I would also like to prevent the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international summit to review the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India is heading to the French capital today, where he is preparing to negotiate on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, they are confident that French companies will be commissioned to build Indian nuclear reactors worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion.
According to the news agency, the deal would last for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian bookshops in Frankfurt
With a strong field, Italian publishers represent themselves at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishing houses will be present at the most important international copyright meeting at the 60th Buchmesse.
This year’s Frankfurt International Book Fair will host 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries on a 171,790-square-square-meter base area, where more than 403,000 books will be presented. The decorative guest will be Turkey.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian government is represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary of State for the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Activities: Italy will occupy an exhibition area of 264 square meters through the establishment of a single Italian Pont.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference held at the “Room Structure” at the Buchmesse 5.0 Pavilion, where you will also have the opportunity to present data, trends and outlooks on the situation of the Italian edition.
According to data, the proportion of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is declining steadily, especially in the area of adult and youth publications.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Billionaire Steve Fossett Flight Missing A Year Ago
The remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett plane, which disappeared over the Nevada Desert on September 3, 2007, were found.
The debris was found on a 3,000-meter-high plateau, in the vicinity of Mammoth Lakes in Sierra Nevada, California and Nevada.
No human remains have been found inside the plane.
John Anderson, the sheriff of Madera County, said: “We sent a team after finding the plane’s location, and now we can be sure it’s the plane Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance.”
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Bureau of Traffic Safety (NTSB) reported that a few hours after discovery of the wreck, a committee of inquiry was requested to identify the plane and determine that it was actually about a Bellanca 8kcab on the 3rd day of the year 2007.
Yesterday, in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found Fossett's personal belongings near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two certificates on behalf of Foss, issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Authority, some cash and a sweater.
His search was abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire set up a number of peaks through which he entered history.
In 2002, for his sixth attempt, he was able to first orbit the Earth with an air balloon: two seven lonely flights.
Three years later, he flew through the country without landing.
Many records include the flight over the Andes, at an altitude of 15,445 meters, which he performed with a second pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
An unusual, at the same time original and determined form-world hobbit, with large surfaces and cleaned corners.
In a nutshell, this is Mercedes-Benz’s newest “compact off-road vehicle” with which the German automaker has tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
This is precisely why the SUV GLK launch campaign available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th will be surprising and unusual.
In fact, the advertising campaign that accompanies the introduction of the new vehicle lives on an unprecedented media communication device, including utopian 3D posters that have not been used by a car brand in Italy.
The giant poster action, which consists of three stages, will dominate Milan’s central shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first stage of this new type of media communication begins with the introduction of the space-effects of the car, within which the new SUV, with the help of special glasses distributed around Corso Como, will be available in almost real sizes and in three-dimensional form.
The viewer will feel as if the car is pulling out of the poster.
Afterwards, with the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new GLK becomes visible in every detail to then form a single image.
Undoubtedly, with this promotion, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the automotive stereotype advertising world.
Will this be able to attract the interest of future customers? We’ll see.
We'll show you who the Italian football fans are.
Youth from Triveneto, they're likely to be excluded from the tracks.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of all of Italy? Members of the group called "Ultras Italia", which has been following the team for years, and which, in fact, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They never clashed with their opponent's supporters.
The core of the group is on the right.
The main organizers are from Trivento.
Also from Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
They were joined by smaller dispersed groups from Campania and Puglia in Sofia (in fact, only a few units).
Italy’s flags were flagged on which the fans’ hometown was displayed: they were taken away on Saturday so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of the English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi supporter team, the Levski printers.
The Italian Football Association has allocated 144 tickets to the Italian fans. These were tickets with the name, making it easier to check the fans’ team.
The Ministry of the Interior checked out everyone: there were no parents in Sofia who were in the process of prosecution, no one who was banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans, who have a football-related privilege, have been denied the ticket and the exit.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior is awaiting the minutes from the Sofia Police, and then takes the necessary measures: fans who have been arrested or identified during the disturbances can be subject to a five-year ban.
This is an international ban, which applies not only to the visit of Italians, but also to all stadiums in Europe.
So our soccer fans can't put their feet on any football field.
Fortunately.
But we also need to be afraid that the Huligans will find followers, that is, that they will join this little one hundred and fifty-something.
"This fire must be stopped right away, it must not be spared anyone who behaves in this way," the Interior Ministry said.
So it’s better to keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesday’s day of the team match is approaching, Lecce.
In Puglia, there is a small cell that supports Italian ulcers.
The Observer Service will meet tomorrow, and on Tuesday the Committee for the Analysis of the Safety of Sporting Events, which can also count on one of the Departments of the Internal Security Service, secret services dealing with the behaviour of fans.
"Duce-Duce scandal and swinging arm under the Italian anthem? No crime in Bulgaria..."
This idea was expressed, unfortunately, by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago as the head of the observation service of the Ministry of the Interior (the post was taken by Francesco Tagliente and before Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly the Chief of Police of Trieste, the city where he has been operating since 2002, a cell that supports the Ultras Italy group.
What Mazzilli says is true is that it is not forbidden in Bulgaria to live the Duce, but the behaviour of 150-200 fans was still shameful.
I am not a sociologist, added the first person in the observation service, but crimes must be judged in the country where they were committed.
So far, this group has not caused a problem. We need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let us also talk a little about the extinction of the Italian hymn: it is not a crime, but if I am free to say so, it cannot be called well-education.
