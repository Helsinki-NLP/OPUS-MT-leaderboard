It's out of my jurisdiction.
It was yesterday.
I'm starting to love myself.
Who wants to be your son when you grow up?
I'm over here.
Don’t tell Tom what actually happened.
I'm not just gonna give you that.
What are you gonna say then?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Get down here.
Why can't I see her?

Tom screamed and ran out of the room.
This soup gives the fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He talks too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
Didn't you know I taught French in Boston before?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to win time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke in a terrible, from the point of view of the Jews, the Galilean dialect of the Aramaic language instead of the Hebrew, thus showing the inconsistency of the claims of the existence of any sacred language, the use of which God is near in personal prayers.
In the end, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is slightly different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
So they paid <0x24>300 for it.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom's gonna do.

Is this my book?
Laundry is routine work.
Who else is on the list?
Don't give Tom my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I'd like to know what to say to them.
Tom's kids must be missing him.
I thought Tom was wrong.

He's studying physics in Oxford.
He was hiding this fact from me.
Are you the one who saved me?

Someone needs to talk to him.
I've never worried about them.
Tom was able to get to the hospital on his own.
I sat next to Tom.

I think this medicine will be of great benefit to you.
Tell Tom to be here by the middle of the third.
This is not God’s message.

Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.

Get out of my office.

I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what Tom had to do.
Say hello to her from me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's response shocked everyone.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom in response?

Is Tom smiling?
She went to Paris.
Tom's at school now, right?
Let us know, please.

It was just a joke.
Try to prove that I'm wrong.

Do you have any pain somewhere?
He couldn't leave because of a lack of money.

Yesterday, Tom suddenly called me.
We really need that.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the glasses.

My eyes are hurting.
I love stories.
We need to be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom left Mary his keys.
I talk to him all the time.
I can't stop laughing at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God foretold the union of royal power and priesthood in Jesus Christ.
You want me to talk to Tom myself?
Every one of us went home to himself.
The thread is thin, but strong and doesn't scare.

I hope no one has seen you come in here.

Times may change, but human nature is the same.
Tom seems to be very upset about something.
I brought the cake.
Next year, Tom will be teaching French.
I listened to her until the end.
I advised Tom to rest.
Why is it annoying to you?
The worst part of the trip is back.
We'll miss you both.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in the shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you do it!
This knife was good for me.
How do you know what I had?
You'll only take a minute.
I would very much like to change this situation.
We took care of everything.

Just tell them what you need.
We're planning on leaving as soon as possible.

There's no salvation for her.
I'm sorry I did this without you.
You're bleeding out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, huh?
I hope Tom is in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants the same thing you want.
We can't just ignore that.
Where did you meet Tom?
Where is the supermarket nearby?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't know Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you're fake, join.
Tom wanted to apologize to Mary once more.
Tom was thinking.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can’t swim.
He's never been.
I'd really like to go with you, but I can't.
That's never happened before.
I wasn't going to do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Come on, you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary exchanged places.
How do they take you out?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful person, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is under threat.
Mary sewed Alice's new dress.
That decision was hard to make.
I thought you'd like a drink.
I got what you asked for.
He said he'd do it.
That's why I didn't have to leave.
Mary recovered from the illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get that?
Eating meat is harmful to your health and the environment.
You're telling me you don't know anything about it?
What's your plan, Tom?
Tom is not able to enjoy life.
I want you to say a word for me.
No one likes me.
I'm sorry I don't know Tom's phone.
"Tom knows." - "Yes, you told him?" - "No, he knew it all."
Your explanation was very clear.

Tom will pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is the crying owl.
I don't have this book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is at the center of the solar system.
Are you a cop?
Tom cheated on both me and Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut the razor.
Tom and Mary seem to be more than just friends.

Somebody's missing.
I'll tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Look, don't slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I'm used to going to bed early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom's in the office.
All Tom does is watch the TV.
Tom is in a good mood today.
It's the most delicious berries I've ever eaten.

Tom was never late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go to your father's question.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a short comment on each letter.
It's hard to take you seriously.
Members of this tribe settled along the river.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When did it start?
No one cares about what she thinks.
That doesn't seem strange to me at all.
"Where did you get my phone?" - "Tom gave it."
When will you clean the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Does it make sense to do this?
Why are you closing the door?
Tom said he tried to do it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at eight o'clock in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You can't write programs.
Change the subject.
I love to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom is low, but strong.
It's cold this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She's cooking dinner.
Find it, please, Tom.
He'll give it to you.
This proposal is unclear.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
You don't understand what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom and Mary divorced last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is infinite!
This box weighs a ton. What's inside?
He gets it all because he's an asshole.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he's never met her.
It seemed like he was going to kiss me.
Don't yell at me.
Are you having fun?
That's unlikely to happen.
I'll order it later.
Didn't you know Tom's going to Boston?
This is our school.
Yesterday I was off all day and today I am working.
Take your coat, it's cold today.
If you think about it, I really need a mobile phone.
Don't lose your patience.
Why is Tom angry?
What a horrible man!
Cardboard is harder than paper.
Don't be mad at him.
You've exceeded your powers.
The curse was destroyed.

Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer they went to a mountain resort.
Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.
Tom and Mary are not afraid.
Can you come closer?
She's a little shy.
What kind of action do you expect from Tom?
She seemed to be completely calm.
Click on the button.
Tom and Mary went to the museum.

It's a lie.
I'll keep an eye on them.
She said she was cold.
The road inspector was very rude.
Tom wants to follow his father's footsteps.
I don't see any problems here.
I don't have to do it tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's awfully bitter.
Tom told you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on your way to work.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Last time, Tom was the first.
They're all different.
I need to see you.
I lost your phone.
Put the tree out there.
Do you usually wear a bicycle helmet?
Tom's gonna fix it.
Tom said goodbye to his sister.
My mother was busy cooking dinner.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.

There's a bench under the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
How's my story?

What's the weather there?
I sent her a message.
You owe me <0x24>300.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
You're not gonna introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She was crying.
I told Tom that Mary had to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living outside the city?
How long have you been up to this?
We've finally got everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.

Did you tell Tom?
I! I!
Tell me what you saw.

Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I made a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did all this.

Let me know if you're in need of any help.

He said he hoped to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Calo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.

Last Monday, I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take your shoes off?
We went to the beach.
Do you think there will be snow for Christmas this year?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from a friend.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me as well.
I'd like to have a coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth at all lately.

All the bills have to be paid to me.

This time I'll forgive him.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.

Get out of here now.
Can I look at your rights?

How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot his sweater.
Tom lives in Australia as well.
I didn't know exactly where to start.
That's the memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets for the concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom's exam of bliss.
He had sent several letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in your pyjamas?
How much does it cost?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to take care of the garden.
A glass of rice weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I should have left Tom a note.
You're Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I've been waiting for Tom since the third half.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.

Someday you'll thank me.
Tom watches TV sometimes.
I'm ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I'm still thinking badly.
Run, chickens!
I had a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the present situation.
I know what you told her.
I fell asleep only after two hours of the night.
Mary wasn't thirsty.
It wasn’t as hard to fall asleep as he thought.
I don't like that.
I tried to wake up Tom.
It is said that the film is very interesting.
Do something about it, please. I'm sorry.
As you know, we're late due to heavy rain.
Apparently, she's healthy.
Tom was in a wooden hat.
Take care of your sister.
Tom said he was not going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I love the bitter pepper.
What time do you usually get up on Saturday?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Summer Olympics.
I've never betrayed you.
We've done this together before.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no invincible.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom knows how to draw.
They're smelly.
I didn't know it would be impossible to do that.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was there snow yesterday?
You scared her.
You won't get Tom.
You killed her?
Does Tom speak French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to walk.
We didn't discuss this.
Tom took Mary's cup of tea.
Tom could not understand why no one else wanted to go to the zoo.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary in self-defense.
What is the difference between faith and trust?
Tom put the newspaper on the table.
What did you find out?
If the weather permits, we will head to the top of the mountain tomorrow.
We're both familiar with him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom was reading an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more difficult it seemed.
His gray eyes glowed and glowed, and his usually pale face revived and covered with a reddish.
What kind of pizza do you like the most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take another one.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands slipped from the cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do it with caution.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
The typhoon has destroyed many homes.
This man was sentenced to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom's still living in Boston.
Let me get your luggage.
Besides, I don't know how to dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
The power is in Tom's hands.
I learned to play and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me?
No one's going to blame you.
I'm not really busy right now.
Kids like to play more than to learn.
He was taken as his younger brother.
What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger.
Everybody tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary is in Australia.
My boyfriend is a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don’t like people who insist on talking about politics.
Is it red or white?
We are not afraid of fighting.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Let's go!
Do it until it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom is not accustomed to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
Did you suddenly get into fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're sad.
Yesterday my granddaughter was born.
On Tom's pirate suit.
It's pure truth!
Let's go for a ride.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom's gotta be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out.
We are proud of our achievements.
That's why I should have invited Mary.
Tom had to be punished.
You're generous?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not a girl.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a taxi.
Stop hitting the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know that this man is the one he pretends to be?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald of Sines, introduced Christianity to Denmark.
We can't do anything for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was cautious.
Tom could have stayed for a while.
Almost everyone was dead.
You gotta get up early.
There's nothing wrong with it.
The last few days have been very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You're not allowed in this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him right now?
Tom is very talented and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Did Tom buy Mary?
Tom likes to read German Hesse.
Actually, I've never spoken Portuguese.
When criminal cases come to court, it is generally accepted that there are twelve people in the jury.
What was Tom doing at the Australian Embassy?

The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very confused.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very acidic.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized there was something wrong with him.
We had no idea Tom was going to do that.
There's another day gone.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was severely damaged.
He was hurt when he fell.
We are impartial.
I have mosquito bites all over my hand.
Tom, come on, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you keeping track of your weight?
Tom plays the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I don't want her to be in my house.
You probably won't be able to do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald's is known worldwide for its hamburgers.
Tom made Mary an expensive gift.
Do you have any opinions?
Do you like these spirits?
The castle is broken.
Diamond is a precious gemstone.
Get some cake, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Retrieved, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want the best.
Tom works as a waitress.
It'll be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
Was that too simple?
What Alice encountered, waiting for an answer, was a sudden war. It was a rugby noise, so loud to break her drum bumps, and so loud to reach the sky.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
That's why you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary take things in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I've done is wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I tried to solve the problem in vain.
You should've done your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy that I couldn’t lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
He will answer, as he will answer.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried a banana cake?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
He's your teacher?
The rich sometimes look up at the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we explain this to the children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey fell on the tree.
The language I’m learning is very difficult.
Your child can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I'd rather not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm getting married.
Do you really live alone?
I told you I'd come back.
Tom is my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President rules for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for that.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Couldn't you solve this question?
Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
In a building of twenty floors.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
You don't know when Tom's coming back?
I don't have photos of Tom.
Can you wait a minute?
Will you give Tom something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
Next month I will be very busy.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would have been a rich man now.
I made this decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
A strong wind has risen.
Tom did not dare to try to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He runs as fast as you.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag's empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's as stubborn as an asshole.
I think we can rely on you.
She knew she was wrong.
It's so clumsy!
Tom had the premonition that Mary would take her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in a dream last night.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say it again!
I called him, but some girl picked up the tube.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she was going to win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very strict with the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He was prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom was interested in it.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got a little slippery slope.
Do you understand what she said?
You're kind of distracted.
Don't be mad at her.
I'd better stay.
That's why a brilliant idea came to mind.
She's resting now.
I'm refusing to leave Boston.
Tom said I wasn't going to help.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a reliable place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect Tom's supposed to go to Boston next week.
Don't walk on someone else's land.
Tom was horrified.
Tom's face was red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hungry was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
The room needs a new curtain.
Can you stay with them?
Tom arrived early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left.
Somebody poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
She's got legs hurt.
This is a risk we cannot afford.
Can you give me a minute? I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to take you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do that often.
I hope we don't do that again.
How many times have you helped Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I would be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewelry are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, it will be time to open.
I'm not sure what size it is.
He was also good for animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the torch and went into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas walked out the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't stop thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was a daughter-in-law.
Who doesn't admire them?
We were crying with him.
Don't you want to try again?
Hold on a little bit longer.
Why are you so split up?
From milk you can make butter, cheese and more.

She spoke more French than that.
I'm glad you're here now, Tom.
Where did she find this book?
Did you get news from your sister lately?
You need to have breakfast.
So what do you want to know?
Tom didn't go, and so did I.
Choose the expressions.
He just got back.
Mary laughed amusedly.
You'll have to wait here.
I'm tired of hearing your complaints.
Tom and Mary, as usual, were wasting their time.
Please tell them it's urgent.
You'd be perfect for this job.
How's Tom doing?
We gave her some apples.
I'm not naive.
I didn't tell her you were here.
Can you briefly describe Tom?
I should have told Tom to wait for him.
Please, wish me good luck.
I'm glad you're alive.

I was kidding before that.
I don't know if Tom has a bike or not.
Don't make me lose patience.
I like a lot of things.
I don't think you have to do it yourself.
Tom's more dangerous than that.
It's not his wife.
Don't spend any more time with us.
How long do I have to wait?
I don't think I need anyone's permission to do that.
I need to find her.
We needed Tom's help.
Breathe through the nose.
Look at this from her point of view.
Tom was the only one not swimming.
He has a literary talent.
God can do anything!
Bring the kids.
Tom thought you knew Mary.
Tom knew I wouldn't do that.
I'm so lucky.
Tom's in a bad mood today.
I didn't mean to hurt them.

We all love you.
Here and now.
I'm not very disappointed.

Please tell me it's not a bomb.
I don't want to run into Tom.
I took the train.
I applauded.
I forgot to water the flowers.
Tom packed up his stuff and left.
She's talking about you all the time.
I respect you and Tom.
I fell asleep on the train.
Tom made his own decision.
I thought you'd be busy.
Can we wait here?
You're impartial.
Tom brushes his teeth at least three times a day.
Tom was able to talk to women.
Let's determine our location before we go further.

What did that mean?
You should have told me in advance.
I have a cross in my garden.
He's looking for a job.
I'm looking for my cat.
I had to ask her first.
Enjoy the moment! <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Who ate all the cookies?
We'll fix it.
Mary finally found her keys.
This information strengthened him in his opinion.
The worst enemy and the best friend of a man is another person.
Tom wanted Mary to make him something to eat.
Don't wait for me for dinner.
Tom didn't want to wait.
Excuse me, I'll leave for a second.
We didn't ask.
Tom knew what had to be done.
I know it won't happen today.
I don't think it changes anything.
We had a vacation on the lake.
I didn't know who you were.
She reads her favorite book.
Tom smiled politely.
Rabbits can swim.
I've got some money with me.
Our team has a good chance of winning.
One square meter of a solar battery generates about one watt of energy, so it’s not easy at the moment to use solar energy on a large scale.

Is this new car?
I have a question for you.
The train station is a 10-minute drive from here.
Who are you to decide this?
Eat the cat.
Tom's a little busy, so he won't be able to help you tonight.
What are your plans for the weekend?
They can catch us.
I'm sure he'll go.
Go and ask him.
Let me take a look.
Private charity is just a drop in the sea.

Give me the torch.
Did you tell Tom he shouldn't go?
In summer, nothing compares to ice cream.
I saw her playing the piano.
I knew Tom wouldn't go.
Do you like to drive a car?
The car didn't move.
Mary knows she was wrong.
This skirt is a little too tight.
Let's try to keep calm.
Tom's in the park with friends.
She spoke fast.
I shouldn't have fooled Mary.
The baby's in the crib.
I didn't tell them you were here.
Tom took the offer and rewrote it.
You could've been hurt.
Get out of this room.
You should not smoke while working.
Tom wanted to play poker with us, but Mary didn't let him.
Tom didn't do anything all week, he just complained about Mary's stiffness.
I think the car's broken enough, and I can't do anything with my bare hands.
Did Tom approve?
I would like to be Canadian.
It only happens occasionally.
We all pray for Japan.
No one wanted to talk about my country.
Just call me.
Why can't you go to Boston?
You are free to do whatever you want with your money.
Anything you want?
She's gone before I get home.
Tom was not the only one who was arrested.
You could've at least punched!
You're only making things worse.
I think you should take a little rest.
He's a good man.
I can't guarantee that we'll be able to finish the work by next Monday.
I didn't do it very well.
Tom really needs you.
I appreciate her loyalty.
Pyjama is a beautiful language.
I don't want to be cut.
I believe in love at first sight.
Do you remember the names of all of them?
I'm eating cucumbers.
I didn't wait for them.
Tom changed his mind again.
I'd like to talk to you alone.
I thought you weren't dating him anymore.
This magazine is selling well.
Her clothes attracted a lot of attention at the party.
They're going to get married tomorrow.
She was right, and he was wrong.
They pulled the shovels to who to go first.
Maybe we should ask him the way.
Fortunately, it worked.
Tom won't call.
He said it was cold.
I like to spend time with friends.
I didn't know you were Canadians.
If you take the baby out and point him to the moon, the baby will look at the moon. If you do the same with the dog, she will look at your finger.
Tom took a beer.
Tom didn't want to explain anything.
I'm sure I've never seen her before.
I didn't know who else to call.
I didn't know how unhappy Tom was.

At the end of this year there will be an economic crisis.
Don't let anyone get fired.
You didn't know them, did you?
Tom showed Mary the letter he had received from John.
“The psalms are boring,” said the girl.
That's what I want.
Tom once taught me French in his day.
Where did Tom get that coat?
Don't forget to close the window.
Could this be acceptable to you?
How will I get to work?
Tom says he'll fix it.
I'm suggesting you put a lock here.
This news is new to me.
Tom wants you to help him do it.
She has a very tight schedule.
Tom speaks French as well.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
Tiger lilies bloomed in the garden.
I told her not to do that.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do it.
We're here to wish you good luck.
Do you remember his name?
Tom put the toys in the toy box.
I don't want you to drive.
He said he'd come.
"Doctor, I'm being ignored." "Next!"
His only goal in life is to make money.
He gave the dog a piece of meat.
Letter to you.
Tom's grandfather couldn't read.
I'm not a doctor, I'm a teacher.
She said she liked him.
Do I have to go with you?
Give him the microphone.
Tom spent the night at the hotel.
I explained it to her.
Tom's indecisive.
The nuts!
I'll postpone my departure if it rains.
Everything must be flawless.
There's something else I want to discuss with you.
It's the tallest building I've ever seen.
That'll cut my ear.
What are you doing tomorrow night?
Are you a musician?
It's been 10 years since my mother died.
When mixing the three main colors, it becomes black.
Get in touch.

I want to go on a date with him.
You cheated on Tom.
What are you doing in my room?
We miss Tom so much.
He answered his parents.
Tom, have you eaten yet?
Who did you give it to?
I held him for the necklace.
No one's asking you to do this.
I forgot that it's April 1 today.
Please stop singing this song, please!
Tom sniffed the dog.
I know you left early.
Tom's been doing it all morning.
I'm aware of the consequences.
The city divides the river into the east and west.
Why are you jumping?
Do you know anyone who speaks French? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Is that why it was scary?
Tom invited me to stay overnight.
I don't think it's Tom's fault.
I'd really like you to stay.
I'm impressed by your French.
We both want to do that.
If the ice warms up, it melts.
We could've done it.
The doctor said Tom needed surgery.
I recently changed my toothpaste.
Here's something for you.
This is your bedroom.
Tom is realistic.
Who's knocking at my door?
When and where did you meet Tom?
I'm here to visit you.
I'm feeling awkward.
Our team has returned home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom was married to an older girl.
I listened to him.
Why don't you sleep?
Did he come to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I've heard you cry.
Show me how to do it!
Everybody's silent.
Let the dust lie down.
Why are you so busy?
He got into his Chinese teacher, but with all these hormonal issues, he got into almost every meeting.
I am glad to inform you that I have completely recovered.
I've written a lot of sentences in Esperanto.
I like watermelon more than pastel.
I can't make exceptions.
He thinks fast.
I can find them.
I'm here now.
You have the right to a lawyer.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
I have my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't give up.
You stole it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My dad loves fishing, just like me.
Hey, it's me.
Dan showed himself a supporter of the superiority of the white race.
I'll try to distract them.

My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom cooks better than I do.
He floats like a butterfly.
Tom didn't tell Mary he needed to buy it.
She brought a bullet.
"Tom, write down." - "I'm going!"

We're not partners.
We have already faced this problem.
I'll try to say it in French.
I'm not like everyone else.
I was able to get two tickets for the concert.
He likes to take pride in his father’s successful automotive business.
She's in sunglasses.
Come on, Emilia, your father is waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of the computer?
Tom can barely walk.
There's a minus to minus plus.
In the basement of the corpse.
Please, make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
There's nothing to say.
I prefer to travel on my own.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I went to the bakery.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're cool.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Jane's farewell speech really saddened us.
I'm trying not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
Look smart-looking.
I'm grateful for your help.
He couldn't hold his smile.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is the recognition that you didn’t even know that you didn’t.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should have thought well before you got her pregnant.
Tom says he's not marrying Mary.
I caught two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's gone mad.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is my father's friend.
Can I come too?
Is Tom earning enough to live in the city?
The interrogation is over.
Please turn off the radio.
He didn’t seem to be sure of his answers.
I heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take off your coat if it's hot.
There are so many.
He could not adhere to principles.
Mary says she's lonely.
You're probably going to be out at three.
It was an easy decision.
Mary said she'd come sooner.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Do you still buy lottery tickets?
Anyone can do that.
A single language is never enough.
Mary told me she was Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom's got a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
The main thing is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom singing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
There was nothing wrong with my thoughts.
Tom maintains cleanliness in his room.
These three books belong to Tom.
He jumped from one topic to another.
It's an armistice.
You told him I was here?
Tom's coming in.
It's not cold today.
I accidentally put on Tom's shirt.
Looks like the bank's robbery was planned up to the smallest.
He didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.
Hold on a second.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank is empty.
Why didn't you show it to Tom?
Isn't the weather great?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I was bathing in the river.
Tell them to take off the pipe.
Can you tell us what this is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's a butcher, isn't he?
Don't force me to kill you!

They don't respect him.
There's no choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't be mad at us.
You can't answer.
Tom has a lot of books.
Can you distinguish the alligator from the crocodile?

Do you really want me to tell Tom that you killed his father?
Your teacher called me.
I'm your father.
Can I be alone?

Do you know how dangerous it is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower in the morning?
All right, everybody, listen, please.
Is it made of wood or metal?
Excuse me!
I think Tom is my friend.

You're so stupid.
Does Tom know that you can't speak French?

I won't tell you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It’s better to be alone than in bad company.
It's false data.
There is a noticeable difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom is lazy.
I have to tell Tom not to do that again.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's making a appearance.
Come closer. Come closer.
We stayed at Hilton Hotel.
That's why you should tell Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She was constantly complaining that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
There's something to be done.
She gave him a present.
Mary takes care of herself in her room.
Everybody, watch out!
At that moment, I fell in love with that language.
Tom's safe, isn't he?
Did you order this pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom is my close friend.
Do not do two things at the same time.
You shouldn't have gone to the woods alone.
No one sees my tears.
Tom fell asleep again.
She really likes you.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are reusable.
Tom has never kissed anyone before.
I'll tell them you're in.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm so glad to meet you.
I almost forgot about the meeting.
They had a wedding last fall.
He's helping me.
Hands up!
Everyone knows we didn't do that.
I thought Tom had never been to Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five years old.
We complained to the manager about the noise from the neighbors.
I won't let you do that.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need it.
Honesty is one of the virtues.
As you meet the new year, so you will spend it.
There are no books in the library in French.
Any generalization is dangerous, especially that.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write this a hiragana, please?
We don't think that matters.
No one understands you as I do.
Act according to your age.
You know how to jongle?
You killed your wife?

I've never seen you so happy.
He took a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's over here.
You see the star?
Ask Tom about it.
Get the rope!
You've said it so often.
Tom says he's not hungry.
That's always been the case.

I thought Tom was your best friend.
I feel very sorry for Tom.
There's nothing to show me what to do.
Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
Tom didn't tell us how upset he was.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know this better than anyone else.
I don't know what Tom's thinking.
I knew it was something like that.
There's nothing to hide, right?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The bill must be paid by the first number of the following month.
My French is awful.
We need some help.
You're scaring her.
For me, Boston is a cold city, not Chicago.
Tom was the victim of an attempted extortion.
I can't speak for colleagues.
Tom lives far away from you?
Why didn't I die?
The dispute ended with a fight.
I didn't take it, you can check your pockets.
Tom came in yesterday.
I'd like to leave a review.
You chose the wrong person.
They took a lot of risk.
We have a white cat.
Maybe you'll never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home yesterday?
If anyone can do it, then Tom.

I live with Tom.
This is where I met them.
You're not wasting your time.
Your problem is that you don’t have enough patience.
Several events marked the attack of the twentieth century.
Stop doing this, Tom.
Tom said he didn't plan to do that.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told Tom to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said there could be no talk about it.
He got out of bed.
The trains follow the schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think it’s impossible not to confuse languages.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Will the exam be today?
What motivates you?
He gave Layla his computer.
Pick up the sleeve.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom's going to meet us?
It is said that anyone in America can become president, but probably not in fact.
Tom never forgets Mary.
The first one on the list is Tom's name.
What else did you miss?
Mary tried to calm down.
What time does the train arrive?
What time does the train arrive in Boston?
Didn't you see that?
I need you to call me.
Tom never suspected that Mary and John were dating each other.
When I get rich, I buy a farm.
I baked him cakes.
It's a neighboring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe what Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think about it.
Translate it into French, please.
Get the cold steel!
She needs a taxi.
The crowd was growing rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
That's what Tom told me about what happened.
Cut your hair off.
I'll find her.
Did you think about what I said?
I'm very sensitive to cold.
We're looking for you!
She's loved by everyone.
Compare your answers to Tom’s answers.
Tom has a weak heart.
So I'll have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his beard.
Did you see my dog?
Don't even try to do it yourself.
No one saw you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to come back.
We've already talked.
I can't believe I finally managed to do that.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry, the test is easy.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don’t know which book to choose.
Tom didn't understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
It's a tower.
I'll have to wait.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.
Is anyone here familiar with them?
They're watching you.
How much time do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
That's what we can do.
He knows about his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary is dressed in a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks anyone for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There are a lot of street views in this city.
What are you wearing?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn’t find the hotel.
She's no stronger than I am.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got a double nipple.
We cannot force the people to do so.
Let's take it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand this color.
Do they sleep together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's not married yet.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
We were complaining about our neighbors.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I've never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She also has shortcomings.
I wonder why Tom needs it.
That seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing on Friday night?
Tom is not the only one from Boston.
Will you support me?
What do you not like about this plan?
I thought you were at work.
It's up to you to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter is about to end.
The titles and awards mean nothing to me.
Where did you even find him?
The meeting was delayed.
I'll recognize you.
Have you had a good weekend?
Tom's drinking beer.
You don't want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is it good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need some cash.
Get Tom to drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Get up!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we'll get lost.
I can't call him home.
You should've apologized to Tom for his bad behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy ran to his house.
I don’t know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxi driver when he lived in Boston.
Tom looks optimistic.
He's not going to buy a camera.
I did everything I could to help him.
I'm connecting you to her.
She got the highest scores.
Tom could explode.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color do you associate with your childhood?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of an outdoor housekeeper.
I'd like to hang out.
You owe me notes or something like that.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight, I don't want to leave the house.
He'll be here tonight.
Cat's dead.
Is it only half the ninth?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
Swimming in this lake is not safe.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me today.

Tom said he was glad you were back.
My car's covered in blue shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Laurie's home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I won't make this mistake again.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I convinced her to marry him.
I've been waiting for this day all my life.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane entered the flag.
It wasn't him.
Do you have colleagues for correspondence in Indonesia?
You may have to help her out.
Mary's lost consciousness.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come with me to the concert?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd be happy to visit you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It's not gonna happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hi," Tom said softly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the value.
You don't have to come to the assembly.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new proposal like a message in a bottle: one day it will be translated.
You won't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
We are relatives to him.
I have a granddaughter of your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She began to work in her new office.
Let's take care of it.
I think you're sitting in my place.
I planned to do it yesterday.
It’s too early to drink alcohol, isn’t it?
My parents don’t like the way I dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
That'll be interesting.
I hit him hard and hard.
Why, worse?
It's inexpensive.
Can I take you by the hand?
He's green.
Tom heard the sound.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom didn't sleep all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about cellulite.
You have to start watching the series when all seasons are over!
Road accidents happen on a daily basis.
Where did you go to skiing?
You were at the hairdresser?
Perspective is disastrous.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me a ballpoint pen.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept in two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
Get out.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's all take a picture together.
I failed the exam.
Everyone already knew about it.
You'd better go and help her.
The footballer made a huge mistake.
They're coming too?
She sleeps like a baby.
Tom forgot to release the brakes.
This song reminds me of a girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The explosion shattered the whole building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they embraced her.
This is my cat.
Do you already have children?
Tom didn't want breakfast.
He likes Tom.
Tom doesn’t even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a self-confident idiot.
It doesn't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I guess you need some help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let go of the cat.
I know you're all sluts.
Tom thinks throwing out food is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place is bent to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you told Tom about it yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I have no doubt.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom drank whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's reacting.
I've never met him before.
How much did he cost?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
The sharks eat fish.
I'm the same as I was before.
Do you know the boy who's crying?
No one knew about it.
It's just amazing.
He said he'd never do that.
The thief steals a bullet and a cow.
Tom doesn't swim very well, does he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I were going fishing.
He was just a shadow of himself.
How do we do that?
I can't believe that Tom doesn't really want to come with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
It's all happening.
What day is it?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm an ordinary guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Is that true, Paul kissed Lily in the lips?
Why don't you go there?
Tom never said he'd come with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I need to stay together.
I've heard only good things about him.
I don't work here anymore.
Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You don't compare with us.
I saw the car exploded.
The window's here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me in more detail about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw my Plaisance away.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stay calm! Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV show?
You want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for worrying.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's on fire!
I'm afraid you'll be lost.
I love going to school.
I offered help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank you for your son from me.
Looks like her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
It's your dog.
What do you mean?
You can't do anything about it.
Tell Tom I'm going to go home with him tonight.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer put courage in his men.
Tom's never gonna find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying something like that right now.
I don't know much about hunting.
This is my first time cooking meat on the grill.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everyone already knew that.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You shouldn't lie.
I know Tom's going to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what he meant by Tom.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him looking at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom's gotta be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the policeman his driver's license.
I cut my hair every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's an apple acid.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new directory.
That must have been expensive.

I'm learning to drive a car.
I know that's impossible.
It's a very hot morning.
Tom denied it all.
We better prepare in advance, because the train will not wait.
He likes you, too?
I see you from time to time.
The noise worked on my nerves.
Tell him I'd like to help.
You want proof?
We have problems and worse.
I did everything Tom told me to do.
You need to cut your nails on your legs.
I heard strange sounds coming out of his room.

I've been waiting for this all my life.
Go there tomorrow.

I want the finished report to be on my desk by midnight.
That's why he'll need it.
Your friends are going to miss you.

You wanna take a look at it?
Ask yourself this question.
Tom has a criminal past.
Tom appeared at the wedding with John and Mary.
What time is your plane?
He committed suicide in order to cleanse himself of his sin.

What I said to you made her angry.
Tom didn't do it.
I think you'll like it here.
I'm using my imagination.
We had a great time.
I've never seen you laugh.
Obviously, you love the Russian language.
- Will you help me?
I've bought something.
You're not going that way, are you?
I spent the last Sunday reading the novels.
All my friends say that.
Tom watches too much TV.
I can walk there.

It's a long journey.
Students are constantly asking him a lot of questions.
We were trying to protect her.
Tom's a wealthy man for the sale of used cars.
Where is the registration station?

You're asking me for help?
I'm very tired today.
I'll be busy all day tomorrow.
I hate the sand.
I almost forgot to give it to Tom.
My sister became a good pianist.
We've got a package for Tom here.
I'll do everything I can.
Mary slipped through the eyebrows.
He's gonna break up.
This is a problem that is difficult to solve.
Tom took two boxes into the warehouse.
She is more successful than I am.
Well, that's a complicated question.
He did it himself.
Switzerland is one of the most prosperous countries in the world.
You could at least take a shower.
I'm sure Tom will help you.
Do you love your cute little dog?
I hope you like it here.
I had a great time.
You and I are the same age.
Do you already have any plans?
I whispered and went out.
Just sign up here.
Tom said Mary was stupid.
How fast!
We have five lessons of English a week.
Tom said he feels happy.
The door's unlocked.
Oh, again!
Tom's a little older than me.
I'm a reporter.
You don't want to know who took it?
Why is Tom so angry?
Picking cars is a bad idea.
Tom took the blanket from the bed and turned to it.
Why can't I go with you?

I have a few gifts.
He was welcomed everywhere, wherever he went.
A big dog is always around him.
You don't have to sleep.
That's a lion.

I wanted to see you again.
The humidity is quite high.
I don't remember how I did it.
I'm getting married next Saturday.
You're not coming to the concert with me?
Will Tom stay for dinner?

Wait for her.
Eternity is long.
How's the new job?
Why do you trust Tom?
I don't know much about it.
Maybe I should stay in Boston for another week or so.
I have your key.
How big do you need a box?
I see yours, but where are mine?
This does not fit into any category.
Have you ever saved someone's life?
How much is the rain?
Are you ready?
Don't wake me up until the third half.
Relax, it's not the end of the world.
Their advance was stopped by the broad river.
That's why we need protection.
We all liked him.
Why do you think Tom isn't here today?
I promise to be punctual.
You misunderstood the offer.
I had a wonderful night, but not tonight.
What kind of movie is it?
What is the advantage of this technology?
I think Tom's annoyed.
They wouldn't let me go.
How did you do that?
I gave you what you asked for.
Boston is worth a look.
My father owns a restaurant.
Tom worked in Australia as a French teacher.
He put a gun on me.
I was born in Boston.
I love the fries.
So no one had to tell their story.
You're getting old.
You have a wonderful home.
I resigned.
We'll miss you.
We didn't do anything!
How many people died yesterday?
I'll get you brandies.
Forgive her this time.
Why do you have such big eyes?
I'd like to ask you a few questions right now.
I've only heard Tom play the piano once.
Can you hear me now?
That's not what I ordered.
Is Tom complaining?
They trusted Tom.
Do you like figure skating?
How much is a ticket for a concert?
Tom didn't understand anything.
Tom always says that.
No one has the right to tell you how to live your life.
It was a good day.
She put her head on my chest to listen to my heartbeat.
We've won.
They said they were looking for a cook.
He'll be in Paris tomorrow.
Don't ever forget that.
You want to be a lawyer.
They smiled at each other.
Take one drop of this medicine.
Who can be sure?
We're not coming back.
I'm still looking for Tom.
Did you answer Tom's question?
You've ruined everything.
I'll be there on October 20th.
Don’t forget to take your camera with you.
I was totally shocked.
Please complete this work by the end of Monday.
I broke the grip.
I think it's time for me to change my job.
I guess I'll do better than Tom.
I'm bored.
It was too easy.

You can rest.
Kids play lego.
Tom is the tallest boy in the group.
We live on planet Earth.
It's a tall tree.
I need to see you.
You don't really think Tom would kill himself, do you?
Her death was a strong blow to him.
She's busy now, so she can't talk to you.
There's no way.
He likes it.
I'm just lucky.
I see when men love women, they give them only a small part of their lives, and women, lovingly, give everything.
The tiger licked him.

Don't make any fuss about him.
Mary was wearing a black sweater when I met her.
I did it without permission.
Tom said he didn't have an office.
Tom told Mary she wouldn't do what she asked him to do.
I'll miss you.
Tom and Mary like to talk about celebrities.
What didn't you like about us?

She's been happy for a while.
What made you think it was a fake?
The meat does not break in cold weather.

Tom wasn't hurt.
I know something is wrong, but I'm not quite sure what it is.
He went to jail.
Tom told me I looked tired.
Tom didn't believe what I told him about Mary.
I almost forgot to tell you what happened.
What do you most like to do?
Tom's here with his friends.
Two tickets to San Diego, please.
I'm going to start.
I'm forced to agree.
My mother's sister is my aunt.
Tom's done.
That's my favorite.
His decision saved his life.
I need to find a way to help Tom.
I know Tom's aggressive.
Remember why you're here.
Tom didn't find anything in the old box.
We grow grapes, corn and fruit trees.
The couple had a son.
I'm a rescuer.
Tom gave us a lot of money.
I'll have to agree with Tom here.
If I were 20 years old, I could vote.
Tom refused to help.
Tom came first of all.
There were many people on the beach.
I don't know how long I'll take.
I want to see my friends in Canada.
What is the size of the shoe?
Peace, brother.
I told Tom that you came to Australia.
I trusted you.
Tom couldn't win yesterday.
Why did you lie to me?
Tom's on the train.
I love the sunsets.
Tom has a white dog.
I'll pick you up after school.
How's Tom doing?
I'm waiting for you in my room.
She doesn't want to wait for you.
We'll have enough of your complaints.
Isn't Tom in Boston right now?
Share it with each other.
He broke the newspaper in half.
I promised Tom I wouldn't tell anyone.
The field has already been planted.
Tom is never where he should be.
Tom left the house after Mary.
She's above her mother.

I'd do the same thing.
If you're going after Tom, what time are you here?
We can't just take it and pretend that nothing has happened.

I respect his views, although I disagree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied him a sweater.

Is it cheaper to call after 9?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
Are you planning on staying for a long time?
We ate in a hurry and left right away.
Behind the house is a large garden.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't ruin anything on your feet.
Start each meal with the soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right in front of me.

He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It should have been you.
Mary left her hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
You live there?
What would you eat?
You don't know her?
I didn't ask Tom if he was going to do this or not.
I'm falling.
I was unable to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom is wearing new shoes.
Last year she learned how to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
You don't have to thank me.

The rain stopped. You can reopen the windows.
I've never had one like that before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was going out when I called the phone.
I don't have to tolerate it.
Always go down the road to the right.
We're being asked to show up in a row.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
Maybe she's pretty, but I don't like her.
I can throw you out if you want.
Tom told Mary that she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I've never asked her.
Nothing is as relaxing as a hot bath.
I really don't have that much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There is an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about it.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice like a melodic song is siren to me.

If I had time to do it, I would.
You see Tom's boat?
Thomas is big?
This medicine will help you.
Stop the noise.
My stomach hurts.
You know how busy I was?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I don't trust anyone.
She is a fan of “Sex in a big city.”
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Go to him. Go to him.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop!
Nothing compares to a glass of beer after a long working day.
What's the matter?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.

What house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
What do we live for?
Is it going to rain tonight?
We know about her.
You could've helped us.
I rarely drive a car.
That's why I don't like the ending of the film.
Just get in there.
Just ask him for forgiveness.

I'm sick of you two.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventures.
Tom is in the library.
You were in school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.

He came up and got on his knees.

Looks like no one knows about him.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.

English is the world language.
Sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told Tom to leave Mary alone.
Didn't you know that Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?

The situation is getting worse.
I choose where to have a snack.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new one.

She keeps writing letters.
I don't know who to consult with.
Turn left at the corner.
Tom taught me to do that.
You can do a lot more.
Give me one, please.
I can't bear disobedient children.
That's what Tom bought me.
What you said annoyed everyone.
You're too young for that.
My parents have been married for 30 years.
She has demonstrated her talents.
I wish it was possible.
I guess you can't do that.
I'm lucky to be alive.
At the next school festival, Bob will play the main role for the first time.
You have to stay in shape.
I've been squirming all day.
By the accent, I realized he was an American.
Maybe that's the problem.
Was that a joke?
Mercy! Mercy!
Tom obeyed.
Everyone in my generation thinks the same.
I live for it.
Do you know how to ski?
The Duke owns many lands.
At least have fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad is gradually recovering.
You'll feel at home.
It won't end well!
He looked like he hadn’t eaten for a few days.
I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who is Norman Finkelstein?" - "American political scientist."
Get out of here!
So what's that, I'm curious about? If it's not selling goods at home, then maybe it's a new way to get acquainted with girls?
Tom picked up the coin.
Why didn't you leave your room?
If there is no God, everything is allowed.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
A new one?
Don't take anything right.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please attach the belts during take-off and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both love seafood.
That's what I've been waiting for.
I rejected the offer.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
I'll take too much time to explain why it won't work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build all this yourself?
I look forward to the summer vacation.
Is it possible to formulate it differently?
From here, he looks great.
Wooden houses are easily inflamed.
Let's have Tom's party.
The dog's still alive.
I'm going to college.
I know you lied.
The bed is very comfortable.
I'll report on it tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's been pissed.
I want to listen to your side, go on, please.
I'll wait for him to come here.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is José, we're friends.
You forgot to mention that.
We don't need it anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do it without our help.
Everyone's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who set up the meeting?
I'm such a bad guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight, I need to get ready for classes.
Mary was the only girl in her skirt.
What bird can't fly?
This has to end.
Tom did not respond immediately.
Tom died at the age of seventy.
Life is a gift.
Tom speaks French as well.
The invention of the transistor marked a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.

You look like a girl.
Here are a few photos.
What's on Channel 10?
I hate spinach.
Mom's cooking lunch.
Tom is a pilgrim.
What can I do?
Her son is a genius.
I know you've seen terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He is inclined to give will to emotions.
We were shocked by the news of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I didn't see you.
You're just stating the obvious.
He had cancer.
You are responsible for what happened to you.
It's exactly like a watch.
I know where you're going.
You're catching up for the summer.
Let's do it.
Let's leave this for tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do it.
I don't like doing this.
The cleaner interrupted the conversation.
A cat at the desk.
I don't want to be late for work.
You don't chrome anymore.
Tom was a busy smoker.
Tom's wearing gloves.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom is not accustomed to this weather.
I wonder who will help him decorate the snowflake?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in relatives?
What's that noise?
My son has a hereditary disease.
That's disgusting.
Is it snow?
I'll call you back.
He dropped the glass.
I don't know if there is a country in the world where you can marry your dog.
The best defense is an attack.
She is getting married this autumn.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easier.
Is there anything we can do for you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
Investigations began last year with the confiscation of the computer archives of a man from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's life?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What made you think you couldn't?
We drove back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe that?
Thank you for the correction.
You're crazy?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get this scarf?
They wanted evidence.
