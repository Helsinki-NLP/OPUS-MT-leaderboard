The Welsh people who are calling themselves "smooth-looking muppets"
There was a fear of some AM in the proposal that they should change their title and become MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The plan was to change the name of the assembly and make it the Welsh Parliament.
People from all walks of life in different colors can make fun of it.
Here's an AM from Labour, their group worried that "it would sound like Twp and Pwp."
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp and tae mean twp.
An AM from Plaid said the group was "not happy" in general and thought they could buy something.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open-minded" in changing the name, but also said that the MWP was not far from the word Muppet.
In this context, the expression of the letter w is similar in Welsh and the letter u in Yorkshire English.
According to the Assembly Commission, which is currently proposing the law to change the name: "Any final decision on what the Assembly Members will call its members is also dependent."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that received widespread support to call the Welsh Parliament the assembly.
Regarding the call to AMs, the Commission favoured the Welsh Parliament Member or WMP, but the MWP option received the largest support from public consultation.
The AMs provide potential replacements, but the head of the Presidential Officer, Elin Jones, may be hurt by agreeing to all, which is expected to present a bill within just a few weeks.
The child in the reforms will be accompanied by other changes in the operation of the assembly, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs are the last vote on what to call them when they are debating the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
There will be a vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name and become the "Republic of North Macedonia."
This voting will be carried out with a desire to resolve several decades later in their neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbor means that they own its territory and that Athens has repeatedly rejected its request to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, who challenged the plebiscite to change the name, did not just respect the vote.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, only in exchange for the name change their membership of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Claims Silent as Churches in Harlem Suffer
"Earlier, the old one I talked to, there was a bar and a church in every corner," said G. Adams.
"Now, there's nothing."
The loss of the bars is understandable.
"The relationship between people today is very different," he said.
"It's not the people's fault the bars that people always go to."
For the churches, he pleaded that soon as the princes expected the money to be obtained from the sale of the properties, "they too will soon return to where they began."
In addition, the settlements of apartment buildings can be exchanged with condominiums filled with the kind of people who cannot help the remaining shrines of the community.
"Many white people buy condominiums in these buildings," she said, "so that it can only accelerate the day when these churches will close down again because the people who live in these condominiums will be far away from these churches."
White congregations built the same church before blacks became the metropolis of Harlem - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation left in the 1930s.
The black congregation worshipping near the building took its title.
The black congregation provided St. Martin's under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a villager boycott on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, protesting the reception or promotion of blacks.
The building was heavily damaged in a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's customers made plans, they commissioned Carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his replacement at St. Martin's, called the carillon "the whispers of the wicked."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it "an inexpensively cultural" and "an irreplaceable and cohesive instrument."
In addition to the legendary Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Chruch 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
The event at St. Martin's in recent months is a complex story of architects and contractors, of which some were entered by unordered church leaders and others were entered by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the governor of the parish, consisting of unordered heads - wrote in the diocese in July about the concern of "passing the expenses" of the diocese to the vestry, although the vestry had nothing to do with the reception of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of loyalty in the diocese section.
Thirteen-year-old man killed for lobster in California
A rabbit attacked and hit a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he resigned for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel on San Diego's KSWB-TV, had a half-hour rehearsal on Saturday morning with his friends when he heard a boy asking for a blanket and he approached it with his group to get him out of the water.
This Hammel, he thought he was just excited to catch the lobster he heard, but "I'm going to understand the boy screaming, 'I'm sick!
I'm hungry!"
"He's got his head full," Hamel said as he approached the boy.
"I cleaned up all the runs in the water: 'There's a bunny in the water!'" Hammel added.
The child was run at the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego by airlift where he was listed in critical condition.
It is unclear what type of attack is responsible for the attack.
This lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles at a media meeting, there was an awkward rabbit in the area a few weeks ago but it was not described as a dangerous species of rabbit.
Giles added that the victim had suffered severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials have blocked coastal access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for conducting inspections and for safety.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of rabbits in the area, but most of them are not considered hazardous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's will compete in Boots, Superdrugs, and Debenhams using beauty aisles in the department store style with specialist assistants.
As an important part of entering the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn beauty market, which continues to grow as sales in fashion and homewear decline, it will try out a larger beauty aisle in 11 stores across the country, and will increase in the coming year if the trend continues to decline.
Increased investment in beauty as supermarkets are looking for a way to fill the spaces in the shelf that were previously used for TVs, microwaves, and home appliances.
At Sainsbury's, they double the size of their beauty sales to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current products from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also receive additional branded space as well as those seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket will also revive its Boutique makeup products to be in favor of the vegans most of its stores - something that is being demanded by more and more young consumers.
In addition, Sainsbury's perfume retailer will try to sell perfumes, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the coming year.
Purchasing online and buying a few meals daily at local convenience stores has led to supermarkets being more engaging in attracting people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, will become more customized department stores outlets as the supermarket chain rivals discounters such as Aldi and Lidl that have more service and entertainment non-food.
Sainsbury's puts Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also entered some Habitat since they bought the same chain two years ago, which according to them has helped increase grocery sales and led to revenue growth of neighboring companies.
The last attempt by the supermarket to change their beauty and pharmacy department was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but it stopped after having an argument on how to save revenue from its chemist's stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold their <0xC2><0xA3>125m pharmacy business with 281 stores in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago.
Anila, Lloyds has a role to play in the plan by adding products of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance and past of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in staff with specific training and are willing to give advice.
Our brands are designed to meet every need, and the attractive surroundings and convenient locations mean we're the people's top destination for enhancements that appeal to the inexpensive way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'Angry' after Holly Willoughby broke a <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal
"Dragons Den's widow Peter Jones is angry after TV presenter Holly Willoughby brokered a <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal with her lifestyle brand business to award her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby had no time for Truly, their brand of home appliances and accessories.
The business of the aforementioned pair is similar to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, a 37-year-old actor announced on Instagram that he was leaving the business.
Holly Willoughby has replaced Dragons Den's widow Peter Jones with a sudden withdrawal from their growing lifestyle brand business - to pay off her bumper contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to information sources, Jones was "raged" when the golden girl of TV admitted at a mass meeting on Tuesday at their headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, where he had no time for "Truely," their brand of home appliances1-in-house, <0xC2><0xA3>bunk accessories5.
This business has already been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million worth.
When Willoughby, 37, announced his departure from True on Instagram, Jones flew out of Britain to go to one of his neighboring houses.
According to a source of information: "For now, truly is Holly's top priority.
That would be his long-term future that would lead him over the next few decades.
Everyone was very surprised by his resignation.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, and it's too close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow HQ ready for sale."
The company's experts believe that millions of people will be pushing away the performer of This Morning, which is one of Britain's most iconic personalities, with huge investments in products ranging from candles and candles to household clothes and appliances.
And it can serve as the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin, who has three children, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started True with Capp in 2016 and included Jones, 52, as president in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to be M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
A source close to Jones said, "We will not comment on his business talks."
"Friends and then we'll be friends"
He complained about the criticisms he received from the news media for comments that could be considered "unpresidential" and for being very positive about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Here's Trump in his cheering with the voice of "news anchor."
"I didn't give up anything."
He pledged interest in Kim at the second meeting following their first meeting in Singapore in June that Trump had secured as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
However, denuclearization talks have been closed.
Three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders in the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea could not see "equal action" from the U.S. in what they are doing to reduce arms.
Instead, he pledged, the U.S. continues to press for the continuation of the war.
Trump's response to the rally was more positive.
"We have a very good situation in North Korea," he said.
"We're going to fight in North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a very good relationship."
Here, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - stopping rocket tests, helping to release hostages, and returning the American soldiers' lips.
And he defended his unusual way of telling stories about their relationship with Kim.
"It's too easy to stand as president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this six-story arena, we have about 200 people standing there on their own," Trump said, pointing out to people directly in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia Trailing Island, Death Trail
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has lost their homes, there is no declared national emergency, a prerequisite for mobilizing aid from foreign countries.
"On many occasions, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they do not seek help from other countries, so it is a bit difficult," said Bb. Sumung.
Although the Save the Children team was formed to go to Palu, it is still uncertain whether the foreign personnel could work in the area.
Ani G. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster staff, Indonesian officials are further investigating the situation in Palu to see if international staff are allowed to participate in the assistance.
Despite the earthquake that Indonesia has experienced so often, they are still not ready for the natural disaster.
Although tsunami shelters have been erected in Aceh, they are usually not visible on other coasts.
The loss of the tsunami warning siren in Palu, although there are warnings, is also likely to have reduced lives.
In the best of times, travel between Indonesian islands can be tested.
Natural disasters are particularly preoccupied with logistics.
An optical ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is currently heading to Palu, but is still pending at least three days before reaching the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has become the center of Indonesia's six-month-old infrastructure in his election campaign, and has earned him a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But the lack of funding is punishing Mr. Joko's administration for his imminent re-election next year.
G. Joko was also confronted with the expulsion from the remaining customs of the sects in Indonesia, where most of the Muslims struggled with a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and thousands have lost their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fight in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other destructive weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge goes to match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League win against Chelsea when he scored in the 89th minute of the game on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was expected by Xherdan Shaqiri to be about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal as his team sprinted 1-0.
He liked to take the ball off before heading to the far post of the goal.
The ball flew at the height of the box and it flew at the upper right corner of the net.
Subsequently, the ball fell to the net behind the falling Kepa Arrizabalaga.
"It's just in the right position, to get the ball and players like Shaq are always trying to play as far forward as possible, so I'm just trying to take all the time I can get," Sturridge said at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, so I made it on a shovel and I didn't think too much about it and I just dropped the tape."
Chelsea lead 1-0 in the half-time after reaching the 25th minute from Belgian Eden Hazard.
In that game, the Blues striker handed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before he went to the midfield band and crossed to Liverpool's side in the field.
Kovacic was moving fast to the midfield.
He placed a shovel through the ball, bringing Hazard into the box.
Hazard fired the defense and sat with his left foot on the net far post just after Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will play against Naples at the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League completely at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Tsunami killed in Indonesia at 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster staff on Sunday.
It has been reported that many people were pushed into the building's collapses due to Friday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake that caused waves reaching 20 miles, including Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a staff spokesman, at a news conference.
The collapse of buildings in the City of Palu, with more than 380,000 people, has spread.
A 32-year-old man, suspected of crashing and raping a woman, arrested by police
A homicide investigation opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with bags was found at 7:55am at Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of misconduct.
The police had already urged anyone to approach them in the area who had seen or heard.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just beginning but I'm calling anyone at John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard any misunderstandings in contact with us.
I have also called on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have obtained any dashcam footage to contact us because they may have information that is relevant to our investigation."
A police spokesman from Birkenhead confirmed that the woman was found and she was inside a property.
That afternoon, friends came to believe they knew the woman to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continued as the police said they were informing the victim's close relatives of the incident.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to enter his flat but the police told him that he was not allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was quiet when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told that they have time to wait before they are allowed to enter again.
A policeman was told to a man that the entire scene was considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the place.
He has repeatedly said that it is "sharp."
At 2pm two police vans were inside the cordon while another van was just outside.
Several policemen were standing inside the cordon and tracking the block of flats.
Request anyone with information to DM at <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers without identifying 0800 555 111 and mention log 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's Revolt of Parliament's latest watchdog targeted by the war on 'historic change'
It was fair to abolish it because of its massive Taliban destruction of England's numerous cultural and religious artifacts carried out by its Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described G. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "planning to change history."
Here is John Goldsmith, director of the Cromwell Society: "It is inevitable in the current debate on the removal of the sculptures that will target Oliver Cromwell's image outside the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not command or execute the destruction of sacred images during the English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell was to be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas had done in the last century.
Prove Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent creation of 19th-century Cromwell's opinion and part of the study of a man's history that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Ani G. Goldsmith in The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more in the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course, the monarchy.
There is still a historical debate on whether this is an accurate description of the situation.
It is only certain that the practice of the mid-17th century sank into the subsequent formation of our country, and that Cromwell was a unique figure representing an aspect of that achievement.
It is also worth celebrating and remembering those who have been promoted as Lord Protector."
Pig Killing Man Map of Chinese Farmer
A farmer attacked and killed a pig at a farm in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, known only by his surname "Yuan," who is dead and has a broken artery, was found buried near a pork booth in a farm in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig caregiver is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pighouse on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
According to the report, he traveled with his cousin from Yunnan's neighbourhood on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, her cousin found her dead, and she found an open door in the nearby pork cottage.
Behold, there was a great man with blood in his mouth in the dungeon.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the farmer rented 550 pounds of pork, according to the report.
"Shoot and turn the legs of my cousin," said his cousin, known only by his surname "Wu," in the Evening News Guide.
The video showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour ago.
Yuan or his cousin did not own the animal that killed the man.
Here's a market manager in Evening News, who jailed the pig for not attacking it, as the local police searched for evidence.
According to the report, there were negotiations between Yuan's family and the market authorities for payment for his death.
Although rare, there have been cases where pigs have previously been reported to be attacked by humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked the woman and her wife at their base in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig was employed by a Welsh farmer on his tractor until his wife frightened him away.
After his pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs were not usually aggressive but could serve as a "smoke" to them the taste of blood.
"They're just playing.
They like to be overweight, overweight, and they don't want to hurt you.
"You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remaining power will bring extensive and heavy rainfall to the southwestern U.S.
As reported, Hurricane Rosa has weakened as it travels to cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding and rainfall across northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa's wind speed is 85 mph, which is a Category 1 Hurricane, at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and it is estimated to be 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there is a trolley planting above the Pacific Ocean and it moves east to the U.S. West Coast as Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical humid north to south-west.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rainfall to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, make the tropical humid to thrive in the upcoming trough of extensive and heavy rainfall in the South-West in the coming days.
In the locality, causing hazardous sudden flooding, debris flows, and desert landslides will cause 1 to 4 inches of rainfall.
Deep tropical moisture will result in roughly 2 to 3 inches of rain every hour in some areas, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Approximately 2 to 4 inches of rainfall is expected in the Southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
It is possible to have a sudden flood with a rapid reminiscence of conditions due to the extreme nature of tropical rainfall.
It's not good to go out and walk in the desert with tropical rainfall threats.
The canyons can be flooded by heavy rain, and storms with a swamp of local strong winds and dust throttles can carry.
Local heavy rains will bring the upcoming depression to some parts of the coast of Southern California.
It is possible to reach a total of more than half an inch, which can lead to a slight debris flow and a smooth road.
This will be the first rainfall in the region during the rainy season.
Some heavy tropical rainfall will begin approaching Arizona on Sunday night and on Monday morning, before rains spread on Monday and Tuesday night.
Heavy rains fell on Four Corners on Tuesday and lasted until Wednesday.
As the Arctic gets colder, in October, a slight temperature change can be seen across the U.S., while the tropics remain relatively hot.
Sometimes, it causes severe temperature changes at nearby distances.
There is a good example of extreme temperature differences throughout the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a nearly 20-degree temperature difference between the city of Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining heat of the summer will be tested and expanded again.
It is expected that there will be a hot start in October with the vast majority of the central and eastern U.S., from the Southern Plains to some parts of the Northeast.
New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is expected to be 10 degrees higher than the trainee.
Our long-term weather report says the high probability of higher temperatures for the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh's
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's staggering testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accusing him of sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political struggle continued, with broadcasters delaying the regular program for Friday's final blast: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake to conduct a weekly investigation of the FBI cases.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had found him drunk and tried to get him out of a high school party.
In a hot testimonial, Kavanaugh said that he was 100 percent sure that wasn't the case.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday were watching it.
The company counted the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that released it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people looking at offices.
For clarity, this is equivalent to the number of viewers of the playoff football game or the Academy Awards.
The Fox News Channel, where opinion hosts strongly support Kavanaugh's dedication, has an estimated 5.69 million viewers throughout the day listening, Nielsen said.
The second ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
There are 1.3 million CBS, 2.94 million NBCs, 2.89 million MSNBCs, and 2.52 million CNNs, Nielsen said.
Interest remains high after listening.
Flake was a key figure in the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he favored Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS found him on Friday morning held by protesters while riding the elevator to a Judiciary Committee meeting.
He stood up and lowered his eyes while insulting him for several minutes, and broadcast it live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?
He said, "You have power while many women are powerless."
Before closing the elevator, Flake said that his office had issued a statement, which in the hearing of the committee he would say more.
Speaking live a few hours after all cables and broadcast networks have ended, while the Judiciary Committee has to step up to prevent Kavanaugh's nomination across the Senate to vote on it.
But Flake said he would do this only because his understanding would be investigated by the FBI charges against the nominee next week, which had already been pushed by minority Democrats.
Flake was fortunately convinced by the talks of his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and many other senators, Flake developed a passion.
Flake's fate has power, as it is clear that Republican votes will not expect Kavanaugh to be approved without an investigation.
The FBI has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM Accuses Critics of 'Criticism' About Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of his plans to leave the European Union of "political" Britain's future and detract from the country's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May came for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside May on the newspaper's front page, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson resumed his attack on May's unintended Chequers plan for Brexit, saying he proposed that Britain and the US should collect each other's tips as "sounds of excitement."
Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson after LSU player's death
Police arrested the suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested, and imprisoned in a second-degree murder case, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
The video was released by officials of the fight between Sims and Simpson and police said that Sims had lost his mirror in the fight.
Police picked up the mirror on the scene and said they saw Simpson's DNA here, reports WAFB, an affiliate of CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he confessed to cheating on Wayde.
His salary is estimated at <0x24>350,000, according to The Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish's Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of the death was a headache that ran through the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and local residents for assisting in the investigation prompted the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law students for its "strengthening and seeking justice."
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "disappointed" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you always remember," Wade said.
A volcano finds ashes in Mexico City
To the southernmost part of Mexico's capital is the volcano Popocatepetl.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention reminds Mexicans on Saturday to move away from the volcano after crater activity rose and recorded 183 air and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center monitors a lot of knowledge and excitement.
Social media images show a thin gray covering of car windshields in areas in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in volcanic activity of 45 miles (72 kilometers) far southeast of the capital after a 7.1 landing in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano has been known as "Don Goyo" since 1994.
Catalan separatists have been confronted by police before the anniversary of the vote of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters protested against riot police, and as thousands joined the opposition's move to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's hot vote in the referendum.
The egg and powder paint of a group of pro-separatists squashed the riot police to stop them, and made it black dust clouds on the streets usually full of tourists.
The police were also in the middle of the night and used rocks to control the fighting.
Pro-independence groups have often called "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness" in front of unionists protesting yelling, "Live Spain."
Four people were treated for minor injuries recovered in the protests, a local newspaper report.
Tensions in the region called independence remained high after a year of referendum on October 1 which was considered illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters voted in favor of the vote, although fewer voters voted because most of the voters voted against the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to block voting in the precincts across the region in violent protests.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday to stop the action that supports the national police.
The move continued but was forced to move on another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician involved in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer relied on the possibility that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year, we had one of our biggest moments.
"I'm looking forward to seeing my parents happy because they know, but we're not based now," he said.
Although the regional elections in December had been a success, the pro-independence parties in Catalonia had difficulty meeting this year because they had been exiled or imprisoned and many of their prominent leaders were waiting to be heard because of their role in organizing the referendum and the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on her protest phone in support of the police, supported by politicians on both sides of the practice.
"Just remember it," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in the pre-trial chamber since the last part of last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being an election candidate in Europe is the best way to deal with the rejection of democratic principles and follow-up we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Three men arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a Londonderry house.
The incident took place at Ballyngard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves were destroyed.
It may also appear that at some point there is a crossbow attached to the car.
Menga's shot, winning Livingston against Rangers, 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal ensured Livingston's success
Livingston reported the Rangers to give Steven Gerrard his second third in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's score was needed to set Gary Holt's team up for Hiberian second.
Gerrard's team remain without a Premiership win this season and they will face the top Hearts who beat them by eight points, next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers defeated Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, prolonged their no-three division plays in six games, with head coach Holt who hasn't been defeated since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a chance against brusque visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead for a long time before they scored, if not because of their being directly causing problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson failed, but tried to score, and Alan Lithgow's score went away because Craig Halkett's header found him.
The hosts were pleased to play the Rangers in front of them, as they knew they could trouble the visitors at the set points.
And that's how the important goal came about.
The Rangers turned a free-kick and got the opportunity to Livingston, helping Declan Gallagher and Robinson to care for Menga, who got the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
At that point, the Rangers had already got the ball but they had difficulty escaping the defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little difficulty,
This play continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos had to force the save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was defeated by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow stayed away from another set of Livingston plays.
There continue to be shifts on Livingston's side and still continue to be thrown away, while two penalty claims - Halkett's ending sentence to substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were taken care of.
'Wonderful' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Amazing gameplay and results for Livingston.
In one person, they're good, they're constantly overlooking expectations of higher growth.
Their style of play and character did not change much when they returned to being the best, but a big tribute should be given to Holt for his team boosting since he arrived.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was good, leading the organised defense, while Menga hampered Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the fight.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
Whatever they came from under Gerrard, they didn't meet those standards.
Their last ball was missing - they only opened their side once - and it seemed like a call to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the rank.
Erdogan's reaction in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aiming to settle the relationship between NATO allies.
They discussed human rights issues, freedom of the press, and Turkey's rise to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
This city has the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police have provided security for 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters have come to see their leader.
He also called on hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - most of them Kurdish - to condemn Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept him in the country.
Two different protests blamed the dissident visitor who was considered a hero by some German Turks and accused of being a dictator of others.
Deptford Road: A cyclist died in a car crash
A cyclist died after a car crashed in London.
The crash occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the vehicle and the paramedics arrived, but the man died on the scene.
The crash occurred months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, nearly a mile away from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they were working on identifying the man and informing his relative.
There were sets of road closures and different buses' passageways and the drivers were forced to avoid the area.
Long Lartin: Six officers wounded in the throat
Six prison officials were injured in the rubble in the men's high security barracks, the Prison Office said.
The HMP Long Lartin riot in Worcestershire began at 09:30 BST on Sunday and is currently continuing.
Specialists "Tornado" officers were sent to cope with the turmoil, chanting the eight prisoners and keeping them in one wing.
Officers contributed to the scene for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "There are specially trained personnel to deal with the current incident at HMP Long Lartin.
The wounds were treated by six staff.
"We don't allow violence to be put in place in our premises, and we clarify that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can be held in custody for longer."
There are more than 500 prisoners in the HMP Long Lartin, including the country's most delicate criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prosecutor was hospitalized after a prisoner was arrested.
And in October last year, riot officials were summoned to the barracks to deal with a serious turmoil in which staff were attacked by pool balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Storms Can Be Useful)
Tropical depression is rare for Arizona, but that could happen in the first half of next week due to the passing of the remaining force of Hurricane Rose in the Southwest Desert, bringing the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona has been tracking the floods to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, along with the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to directly pass through Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will approach on Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that "only ten tropical storms have sustained a tropical storm or depression state 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a storm 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest Hurricane Center models estimate 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with an average of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert are likely to gain 1 to 2 inches along with the central Rockies and the Great Basin, which may have a total of twenty-five inches up to 4 inches.
For those who are not at risk of sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing as the region dries up.
While serious about the flooding, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the Southwest is currently experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, about 40 percent of Arizona experienced severe droughts, the second-highest in the category," reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa was the first to land on the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
With storm power still and the fastest wind at 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, Hurricane Rosa is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, reaching north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm covered the colder waters of the Pacific and was weakened.
So it is expected that it will land in Mexico with a strong tropical storm in the afternoon or Monday night.
Rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be severe, bringing with it a great risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected in Baja California to northwestern Sonora, which is likely to reach 10 inches," reports weather.com.
The Rosa storm would then go to Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which would then pass through Arizona to southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main threat expected to Rosa or its lips is severe rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to lead to delicate sudden flooding and debris flows in deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four, arrested for murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, after finding a 16-year-old with ambushes in Somerset.
A teenager was seen injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, at 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he was in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon, Somerset Police said.
Officials appealed to anyone with footage of what happened on the phone to show up.
Kavanaugh 'difficulties' 'hardness, anger' of the Democratic Party, Trump says
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to evade the Democratic Party's violent and violent tactics," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "difficult" with the Democratic Party's "hardness, anger" in the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified in Congress on Thursday, forcibly and emotionally rejecting the charge from Christine Blasey Ford that he had ignored it decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford has also testified to hearing about his allegations.
The President said on Saturday that the Americans "seen the origin and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most powerful brains in the law of our time, a lawyer with a machine history of public service," he said at a West Virginia supporters' meeting.
The President praised Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the value of Republicans' voting in the midterm elections.
"It's only five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not going to run, but I'm going to run," he said.
"So wherever I am, the good candidate is fighting."
Trump said the Democrats' mission was "fighting and preventing."
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be carried out by the end of Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Tsunami and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of deaths is expected to rise
Approximately 384 people were killed, most of whom were suited to the swelling of giant waves on the beach, as earthquakes and tsunami struck Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a party in the city of Palu on Friday when the pedestrians hit the beach up to six metres (18 feet) in the dark, as most of their deaths and destroyed all of its passages.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the threat of the tsunami rose yesterday, people on the beach were still carrying out activities and did not immediately leave and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster prevention agency, BNPB, in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not pass without a companion, it drove cars, homes, it hit everyone on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had left the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
Others climb trees to escape the tsunami and survive," he said.
Approximately 16,700 people fled from 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial images of the disaster agency have shown numerous buildings and shops destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to hear the city on the beach on Saturday.
2.4 million people have been affected by a series of earthquakes.
In a statement, Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released by a major earthquake on Friday was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb to be dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could reinforce the strength of the tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, markets, and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of other victims were seen squeezed under the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and injuries could be higher along the beach 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a place called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication "totally cut off with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were going to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can grow," he said.
The agency's protests were widespread on Saturday as they did not assess that there was a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at a time of warning.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, a man was shown on the upper floor of a building screaming fears of an imminent tsunami warning to people on the street below.
In a few minutes, a water wall hit the beach, as buildings and cars fell.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power losses that cut communications around Palu, and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but food evacuations and other basic necessities were still needed.
The city's airport is only reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until Oct.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia's tsunami has risen to more than 800.
I know it very well.
While the World Vision staff arrived safely in the city of Palu from Donggala, where the employees stayed in the tarpaulin stoves built in the basement of their dam, they saw scenes of road damage," said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's very similar.
While aid groups have already begun the slow start of the disastrous launch of aid, some have complained that foreign aid workers with strong skills have been deprived of travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian principles, funding, equipment, and personnel from foreign countries can only begin to arrive if the disaster zone is declared a national disaster zone.
It's not happening yet.
"This disaster is still at a dramatic level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government has said, 'O.K., this is a national disaster,' we will be open to the help of other countries but there is no situation at the moment."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing continue to hope that their loved ones in life will be miracles that will inspire depressing stories of national disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was taken from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers removed a woman who had been pushed under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended in the first part of this month in Indonesia.
Some of those who were imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including G. Mandagi, were his students.
"As I grow older in the field of paragliding, I have an emotional attachment to myself," she says.
G. Gendon recalls that, in the hours after spreading to the paragliding community the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu players, engaging in the beach celebration.
But his messages resulted only in a color check mark, rather than a pair of blue checks.
"I don't think that was the case then," he said.
Thieves deserve <0x24>26,750 while re-filling ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves raised <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's worker who refilled the ATM's flesh in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The body of the driver of the vehicle removes an ATM from the entertainment complex and is preparing to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release.
While he was engaged, another man "boomed from behind Brink's staff" and stole a purse of money to be delivered.
Witnesses who fled the area have found many crimes, according to the release, but the police did not specify the number of crimes involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper will change his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will replace his name - with Ye.
In his announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The former recognized Kanye West."
Ye has long criticized West, 41, and used the song as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
His release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He will replace the show's singer Ariana Grande who canceled due to "emotional reasons," said the producer of the show.
Apart from the spread of his current proselytical name, West had previously said that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible, 'you' is what it means," West said in the first part of this year in discussing the title of his album on the radio host Big Boy.
"If I am you, I am us, this is us.
From Kanye, which means being alone, to being Ye alone - being just a mirror of our goodness, our evil, our deception, all.
The album is more than just who we are."
He was one of the first rappers to change their name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced a taste for the names Love and Brother Love.
Congratulations on whether or not a single and large letter in the name formerly collaborated with West JAY-Z.
Mexico's Amlo, vowing not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vows never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a brutal retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday pledged at Tlatelolco Plaza that "the military will never use to command Mexican citizens."
Troops of soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration across the country on October 2, 1968, where up to 300 people died during the riots of about a fifth movement of students across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican children by providing monthly assistance to students and opening up more public standards.
He said that the lack of jobs and lack of opportunities for education are disrupting young people in criminal groups.
The U.S. has to double the U.S.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
Comments were made after making advertisements about AI by various parts of the U.S. government, although the U.S. still lacks formal AI strategy as a whole.
China, meanwhile, introduced its plan last year: it intends to be No.1 in AI change by 2030.
"It's a good start to doubling the AI research budget, as the U.S. has greatly abandoned all other countries, and we're looking for the next success in AI," Lee said.
Doubled funding could potentially make the next big AI success, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he promoted an AI system that ranked Otherllo's best American player, and then, became an executive at Microsoft Research and head of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized past U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when the next competition would take place, to help identify future missionaries.
Often, researchers in the U.S. need to try to get help from the government," Lee said.
"China doesn't take the leading academics; if not the corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have taken luminaires from standards to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy would help the U.S. strengthen its AI efforts.
"In my opinion, green cards should be automatically offered to those with an AI PhD," he said.
The State Council of China published its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people and academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations fund researchers from the U.S., but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
In the first part of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to consider partners from industry and academia, and the White House announces the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than <0x24>100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, no action has been seen by the U.S. law seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence within a few months.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name in a referendum
The Macedonians voted to change the country's name to "North Macedonia" in a referendum on Sunday, a move that could arrange for several decades the long-standing ties between them with Greece that exacerbate its desire to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, with a province called Macedonia, insists that its claim on its territory indicates the name of its neighboring country in the north and it has refused the Macedonian country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist successors argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he did not stand in the referendum and has led to doubts the boycott campaign on whether the turnout would reach the 50 percent lowest necessary for the referendum to take effect.
This is the promised poll question in the referendum: "Are you in favour of being a member of NATO and the EU along with accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth the effort to enter groups such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that has been struggling since the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am going today to vote for the future of the country, for the Macedonian youth, so that they can live freely under the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not covered by the law, enough members of parliament said they would follow the result of the vote to confirm it.
The change of name requires two-thirds of the parliamentary majority.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularity at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the previous parliamentary election in 2016 where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I voted for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko voted for the Macedonian referendum on the country's name change that could open the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small stage and illuminating seats in front of customs arranged by boycotters in the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the U.S., but we want to join high lordship and not enter the door of the wolves," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a difficult country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and be part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring the most urgent investment in Macedonia, with a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority is in agreement because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the U.S. and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said that the "yes" result would be a "testimony of our future."
A vote published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters were involved in the referendum - lower than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they were positive.
In order for a referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent and then one vote.
The loss of the referendum will stand as the first major blow to the power government's policy since its replacement in May last year.
View: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero, kicked off all of Brighton's defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling oversaw Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the game seemingly easy with his points in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the start of the series.
He competed between the three defenders of Brighton, before scoring in the open field.
Then, Aguero sees himself surrounded by four green suits.
He forced a defender ahead of running some more at the end of Brighton's box.
Then, he rushed to his left and found Sterling.
English forward used his first touch on the box to give the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a tie on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is having some problems with his legs," City Governor Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time."
However, Sterling gave the Sky Blues the start of the Premier League crap.
The goal entered in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball while at the bottom of the Brighton territory in that game.
He sent a nice through ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane did some touch before taking Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues pushed forward the ball into the net before leaving the border.
City defeated Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, who likes to play as a spoiler vs. Rockies
When the Nationals were removed from the contest in the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But Scherzer always hopes to get the mound position on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but that's if the Rockies still have implications for the playoff with a mad game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Either way, the Rockies took a wild-card position with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but hopefully their first title in the division will still be secured.
"While we're playing for the left, we can hit the mound, anyway, knowing that the feeling here in Denver, along with the club and the rest of the team, is probably the highest level of whatever point I'll face this guy.
Why wouldn't I want to fight it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but they see allegedly let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer held a bullpen session on Thursday to make his 34th start, and pitch on his regular rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander was 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump, Rally in West Virginia
The President did not explicitly refer to the situation in which he voted for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the Republicans' results in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done in November is amazing.
It's only five weeks from one of the most important elections in all of our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running so I'm afraid to fight good candidates," he said.
Trump once said, "You see this frightening radical group of Democrats, you see it happening today.
And they are determined to take power by whatever means necessary, you can see evidence, confusion.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they need to fight to gain power and control, power and control what they want, and we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission "confrontation and obstruction."
"And you can see that in the last four days," he said, as Democrats were called "rage and arm and mock and lie."
He mentioned the name of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat rank member of the Senate Judicial Committee, who received strong criticism from the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
You've released the document?
Ah, ah, yeah.
"No, ah no, I'm waiting for one - that's so dark body language - the most honest body language I've ever seen."
It's not a broad church anymore.
It no longer accepts those who express their thoughts.
When the Momentum activists voted in my local party to beat me, it was no longer surprising.
If so, I'm the last in the Labour MP line that says we're not accepted - all because of the disclosure of what we think.
My colleague in parliament Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she was strongly resistant to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship petition rejected me in disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the importance of a responsible economic, national security policy, in Europe, which is in fact similar to issues in which Jeremy disagrees with past leaders.
The memorial for the meeting of Nottingham East Labor on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as local Labour MP, that's how GC meetings are every Friday night.
Sadly today, this is not the tone of many speeches and has long forgotten the promise of a "more understandable, softer" policy, even if it really started at any time.
It has become more obnoxious that the opposition views of the Labour party are not allowed and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party's superiors.
It began as soon as Jeremy became chief, as colleagues began to rely on me first thought to have a similar political outlook that I had retreated and took positions I had never held - whether in national security or in the single EU market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I'm saying - there is a next row of social media abuse calling for deselection, twisting the politics of the moderate, and saying that I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am even more valuable than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are politically inclined.
I'm fascinated by the professionalism and determination of colleagues facing aggressive sexist or racist abuse every day but never resorting to it.
One of the most deplorable aspects of politics of this time is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week announced that the Labour party should be a party of a culture of reception.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every petition of "untrustworthy" or change of election policies, the party becomes closer.
I've received a lot of advice over the past two years that just motivated me to give up, don't talk too much, and then, "I'll be fine."
But that's not what I want to do in politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student, aroused by the feeling of Thatcher's government's abandonment that was left to literally ruin the school room of my comprehensive school, I tried to promote better public service providers or ministers for local residents as more
I've never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be misleading in any way about the positions of my policy and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who advanced the petition on Friday, all I want to say is, when the country is heading for a Brexit that will harm our homes, our economies, and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my right-wing party.
But, in fact, a message I have is not in Nottingham Momentum, if not in my representative people, whether a member of the Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no number of threats of deselection or political expedienty will stop me from acting at any rate I am afraid of.
MP for Nottingham East Chris Leslie
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The unhelpful Ayr rises to the highest
The last two trials also delayed the final result, but Ayr undoubtedly deserved to win the amazing and entertaining match of the Tennent Premiership day.
They are now at the top of the table, the unique non-stick side of the ten.
In the end, their extraordinary defense, such as their better chance, brought home side and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've tried in our games so far, and we haven't won yet, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "What's good in Ayr, they're adventurous better than us."
Grant Anderson's try put in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr in front, but a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, released for the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to score and got an unconverted try.
Climo beat Ayr's lead in a penalty, before, exactly half-time, he scored and converted a solo try to make it 17-5 at Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's try was reduced, with Baggot converting only five points.
There was then a long delay for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, released by the stretcher, and from the restart, Ayr attacked forward with Stafford McDowall's attempt converted by Climo.
A yellow card was given to Ayr's standing captain Blair Macpherson, and again, Melrose allowed the extra man to pay using an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of the pit of violent force.
However, the home side returned and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card in tackling Climo without a ball, and from the penalty line-out, MacPherson touched down behind the advanced Ayr.
Climo converted, as he did almost from restart, then Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregory Henry away for the fifth try home side.
Bida of Still Game, seems ready for a new career in the food industry
Still Game's widow Ford Kieran seems ready to move into the hospitality industry, after it was discovered that he was named director of a licensed food company.
Jack Jarvis is searching for the 56-year-old on the BBC show, which he wrote and portrayed with his longtime comedian Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth series would be due to run the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning for life after Craiglang.
According to the official list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun reporter indicated that Kiernan seemed to want to be part of Glasgow's "progressive restaurant trade."
'To us the sea': landlocked Bolivia, hoping to reopen the road to the Pacific
Sailors patrolling a battalion of naval wreckage rigging in La Paz.
Public buildings are giving a glimpse of the blue sea.
Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is named after the sea: "For us the sea is according to the law.
It is a duty to restore it."
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline is still clear due to the defeat of Chile in a 19th-century wildlife habit - such as a quest to re-enter the Pacific Ocean.
These wills have probably been at the highest level for several decades, as Bolivia awaited the World Court of Justice's decision on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has a sense of unity, and security, and it expects, of course, with a positive outlook on the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians watch the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, full of hopes that the court in The Hague will overturn Bolivia's demand that - after decades of intense talks - Chile be obliged to compromise on Bolivia's free will.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year - also has a lot of issues that rely on Monday's decision.
"We are coming back to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
But some critics believe that the chances of a court ruling in favor of Bolivia are small - and little will change if this happens.
The UN board based in the Netherlands has no power to produce Chilean territory, and it has agreed that it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The case is "uncomplicated" based on the arrival of the ICJ's decision just six months after hearing the final arguments, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in world law.
And far from the progress of what Bolivia has fought, it may have been hindered by the past four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric weakened any remaining goodwill of the Chileans, he suggested.
At one point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions after that.
Ambassadors have not replaced the two countries since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative to The Hague, rejects the idea that the court's speed of decision is unusual.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "a unique opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to end the 139 people who do not understand that benefit both sides," he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales - still one of Latin America's most prominent presidents - uses the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to pass the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it undermines trust in the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to continue the pledges made at a summit in Singapore between the rebel heads of state.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of reopening nuclear diplomacy after a summit in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un over three months ago.
Ri said he had a "strength dream" of humiliating North Korea with the continued introduction of sanctions and opposition by the U.S. to a declaration ending the Korean War.
Washington has been wary of endorsing the declaration before Pyongyang took an important step in reducing arms.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are both awaiting the second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the emergence of weapons that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The fashion shows in Paris unveiled the latest line of big headwear that will soon be released on a High Street near you
If you want to dress up your collection of hats or cover the sun, don't look for others.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne released a range of uniquely large headwear for their SS19 collection on the runway so the style set at Paris Fashion Week was amazing.
This summer Instagram spread out the overly impractical hats and these designers brought their so-called eye-catching creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's distinctive piece is a truly unique beige hat adorned with a wide brimming bird-shaped brimming around the models' heads.
Other great decorations include a sharp hat, a wizard hat and also a pinch - but they are not designed to keep your head from getting cold.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of funny masks right for Halloween.
Many of the flowering masks have survived more and more similar to Hannibal Lecter than the haute couture.
There is a scuba diving gear with snorkels and goggles, while there is another melting ice cream cone.
And if you continue with this great fashion statement - you're worth it.
As a result of the style watchers, the large bonnets will soon be released on the high streets near you.
The arrival of the big hat is postponed after 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a brim with two faces and seen all dressed up from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the overly-practical hat spread on social media sent again another great creation to the catwalk - a beach bag made of straw almost the size of the swimsuit model with its hold.
The colored burnt orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringing and with an accompanying white leather handle, is the unique piece in Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: ‘I hope to see the arrival of large hats and beach bags on the high street next summer - because the size of the impression made by the designer, it's hard to ignore the demand for large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills that are important to the world's citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain the track record of academic success, and it continues in the year 2018 with the help of another board of excellent exam results, only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to its students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, in their chosen careers and place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that designs and implements the curriculum in the school, we see modern languages continue as prominent and ambitious selective topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in the language he understands, it's going into his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it will enter his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we should not rely solely on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with people from abroad.
From the results of this year's exam, we can see that language is the leading in league tables with the highest rate of transmission to independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages have obtained a Higher Rating A.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of the students received the highest A score in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the German learners, 69 percent of the French learners and 63 percent of the Spa learners.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland are exporting foreign languages as essential skills that young people will no longer need in the future.
Languages today, as a chosen subject, are considered equivalent to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculums of an independent school elsewhere.
In a 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, it was found that among the reasons employers gave for poor filling vacant positions, 17 percent were due to language inadequacy.
Therefore, the language skills are especially needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
At the same time as increasing potential employment opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of a person's chosen career, if he learns a second language, he will have an advantage in the future because of having a life-changing ability like that.
People who speak multiple languages will automatically become insane because of their ability to communicate directly with people from other countries.
In 2013, according to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 people in the UK at the right age, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language and only French spoke two-digit percent, 15 percent.
This is why it is important for children today to invest in language teaching.
Having the ability in many languages, particularly in developing economies, will give young people a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, schools can be different when it comes to the languages they teach.
Many schools will be taught in more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important for the UK when the year 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there is always a choice of language in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland have studied providing an environment suitable for teaching to prepare young people and give them the skills needed to be successful, no matter what happens in their future.
It cannot be denied at this time, in the field of global business, that language knowledge remains important for the future of the country, so it should be saved in education.
Without a doubt, modern languages should be regarded as "the freedom of the world to communicate" .
Independent schools continue to offer this option, diversity and efficiency for the youth of Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron, debuting for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait for the fans to see LeBron James' start for the Los Angeles Lakers is nearing completion.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not clear how many minutes he will play.
"More than a minute but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James' minutes of play are likely limited.
Following the rehearsal in the first half of the week, James was asked about his plans for six games on the Lakers' pre-season schedule.
"I don't need any pre-season games at this point in my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Trump will begin the campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled rallyes next week, including a visit to allied areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote is awaiting his election to fill a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump's goal is to form support for upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to allow hearings this week for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over charges of misconduct while holding the expected Senate confirmation vote for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main purpose of the rally's alliance is to help the Republicans to gain momentum in the November general election.
Accordingly, President Trump's campaign said these five rallyes next week were focused on "acting on volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is very important for his agenda of the president going to as many states as we can as we go to the busy campaign time," said a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named.
The rally is scheduled for Wesbanco Arena at Wheeling tonight and it can deliver supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and get reports from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will be the second time in the past month to visit West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican senator Patrick Morrisey, who is caught in the ballot.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey to have to go to the president to try to force him into the ballot," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showcases courage to keep hope for Sunday singles
After three one-sided matches, Saturday afternoon foursomes may need this Ryder Cup.
A completely invented concept in the field of sports is the "swinging pendulum of momentum" but it is believed by players, especially in competitions like this.
So, according to them, where is the momentum now?
"They only have six points, and now they're only four, so we might have a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth as he left.
In Europe, of course, the advantage is only four points and twelve are left.
Americans, Speith says, think that they have a little bit of courage and strong hearts, because Spieth and Justin Thomas have played together all day and have three points out of four.
Spieth led his side and nodded him from tea to green.
The screams of the celebration were stronger as his round lasted, he entered an important putt to make a table in four matches after being two down after two with Thomas.
There was also a similar scream he putt that won them in the match at 15, the type of scream that says the fight for the American side is not over yet.
"You just have to be careful and think about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each player.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players who scored higher than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the inconceivable Ryder Cup story.
Four out of four can't make mistakes with different but amazing pairs from Europe.
The "Molliwood" were the only couple who did not stay bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also emerged from the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
That bond, and how their energy seems to move from and to the crowded viewer is proof that they are the players to be defeated on Sunday, and no more prominent players can secure a win for Europeans at Le Golf National if not Fleetwood or Molinari.
If possible, along with different holes.
However, the Europeans' victory seems to have been delayed.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpsons quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when they were paired with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles in front of it were tied to Spain and Sweden, and they have not yet risen.
But on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
It's exciting to watch the fourballs and foursomes closely due to the interactions between the pairs, the tips they give and not give, and the possible sudden change of strategy.
Europe's game is better as a group today and they are heading for the last day but this foursome session has shown the strength and strength of Team USA that some, especially the Stateside, have doubted.
Europe lost 10-6 to the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will only be able to enter the final day of the Ryder Cup after leaving Saturday from the fourballs and foursome match with only 10-6 against the United States.
Standing pairs Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molini were ahead with two wins against tough Tiger Woods to bring their tally to four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side including Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to regain the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, prevailed against the American side who minted the morning fourballs, and won the series 3-1.
The United States fought more against the foursomes, and won two matches but they couldn't lower the madness.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood" after a very good weekend, the second pair to win only four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After Woods and Patrick Reed hit the fourballs, they were stunning to join forces to beat the disappointed Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau in 5&4.
Woods, who ran himself in two matches on Saturday, showed moments of wellness ties but received a 19-match defeat in his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose rested for the fourballs in the morning, and returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to defeat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who were in the world's first and third ranks.
The day hasn't been a good day for Europe, even though the weather in the southwestern part of Paris can be relaxed and warm.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans after scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored a vigorous 2&1 win against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after defeating the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has returned from the four-point deficit will enter the singles, but as holders only Furyk's side of the draw needed to maintain the trophy.
After two days of being second in the position, they don't seem to be able to afford a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says it is "unreliable" to disarm unilaterally
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that their suspicions on the United States are deepening due to ongoing sanctions and that the country will not unilaterally deploy their nuclear weapons under such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of representatives from around the world that North Korea had taken "important steps with good intentions" in the past year, such as a crackdown on nuclear and missile tests, the collapse of a nuclear test site, and the pledge not to produce nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons.
"However, we have not seen any equivalent response from the United States," he said.
"As long as there is no trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under this situation we will not really disarm unilaterally."
As Ri repeated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's rejection of a "brother-to-brother" denuclearization approach in which North Korea is honored as it takes small steps, his statement appeared to be important because it did not immediately reject the unilateral denuclearization approach.
Ri addressed a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current U.S. President and North Korea's leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim vowed to try to "denuclearize the North Korean peninsula" while Trump vowed to replace it.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected demands to reduce the stringent international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States is pushing for denuclearization" and assessing the severity of sanctions to achieve their goals in a violent manner, and they also enforce "declaring the end of the war," Ri said.
"The view that we will be subject to sanctions is a strong dream for people who don't know about us.
However, the problem is that we continue to have a deepening of our suspicions."
Ri has not mentioned any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which was announced by the United States chief at the United Nations in the first part of the week.
Instead, the minister announced the three-day meeting between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea and not the United States are the party on this issue of nuclear disarmament," he would not lock a denuarization.
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech completely differs from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that the targeting of North Korean rockets in the United States would not be avoided after Trump's "Mr. Evil President" called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to "reject" North Korea, thanked Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there was still a lot to be done and the sanctions must remain until North is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set time for it, and also said, "If it lasts two years, three years or five months without a case."
China and Russia are fighting for the U.N. Security Council to name Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the implementation of the Security Council sanctions should continue strictly and unreasonably until we fully know about the scope, final and confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council has also imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said after a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been a good one.
He left Pyongyang in July, and said there had been an outcry, only to be blamed by North Korea for making "high-ranging demands."
North Korea has pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to destroy a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "equivalent steps."
He said Kim had mentioned to him the "equivalent steps" he was looking for were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the path to normalization of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard, take a course on having enough rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University helps its undergraduates to sleep well as an attempt to combat the macho culture of learning throughout the night while providing caffeine.
An academic learns that students in the number one universities in the world often don't know about the main ways to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a teacher of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed was the earliest of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a discussion about the effects of insomnia on learning.
"After that, a woman came to me and said, 'Why did this just tell me now, in my senior year?'
According to him, no one told him about the amount of sleep - which I was surprised," he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year the course explains to students the importance of having good sleep behavior and how it contributes to academic and athletic activity, as well as general health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service said the university decided to enter the course after learning that students were completely lacking in sleep for a week.
A one-hour course is accompanied by a series of interactive activities.
In a section there is a picture of the bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, shoes and book to tell about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects athleticism, and the importance of a routine sleep.
In another section, participants are told how sleep insomnia manages the risk of a heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
There is a campus map, with interactive icons, that encourages participants to think about their other day-to-day activities.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe that they have the right to know - as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking," added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of having an ‘all-nighter' continues to be studied, he says, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students are raising the problem of sleep deprivation.
Ensuring that you have enough sleep, which is of good quality, should serve as students' ‘secret weapon' to fight stress, extreme fatigue and anxiety, he said - also to prevent weight gain, because sleep deficiency puts the brain in the state of hunger, so they become hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after taking a class in his first year at Harvard.
He said his eyes were open and he was inspired to pursue a school course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask students to complete a study program similar to this before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should think about setting an alarm when to fall asleep and wake up, and find out the adverse effects of ‘blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can damage the circadian rhythm, and cause problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeat Gerrard's team
The Rangers again suffered a disappointment after Dolly Menga's goal gave Steven Gerrard a 1-0 defeat to Livingston.
The side from Ibrox wanted to record their first win at the opponent's stadium since they won on 4-1 February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, for his side to be beaten eight points against the Premier League.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and did not appear to have the Rangers line-up inspired yet.
While the Rangers are now down in sixth place, Livingston is up third and only behind Hibernian in the goal difference.
And there might be even more problems waiting for the Rangers after the need to give a remedy for the head injury liner Calum Spence after he seemed to stone something from the opponent's side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side to pass Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt used the same Livi 11 who scored against the Hearts last week and would have been pleased with how his excellent team had blocked their matches in each rear.
The Rangers were overpowered to hold the ball but Livingston did more when the ball was in them.
They should have scored after two minutes of scoring near Allan McGregor's goal Menga's pass to Scott Pittman but the midfielder had gone a long way.
A deep free-kick by Keaghan Jacobs was defeated by Craig Halkett but his defender Alan Lithgow had no choice but to force him to win the ball in the back post.
The Rangers took control but seemed to have a greater sense of confidence that their plan would be able to accomplish in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos assumes that he should be given a penalty kick in approaching one-quarter of the game when Steven Lawless strikes them, but the referee Steven Thomson has denied the Colombian player's appeal.
The Rangers made two straight ties in the first half of the game but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not score in Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's night strike.
Although Livi scored in the 34th minute of its debut even though the opponent seemed better, they could not be deducted there due to just their graft.
The Rangers were again reluctant to take action against the deep-seated set-piece of deep Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not retire when Declan Gallagher dropped the ball at the slot to Scott Robinson, who calmly passed Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard took action on the break when he purchased Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and almost had a quick effect on the replacement when the winger was able to slot Morelos, but quickly ran out of his line the amazing Kelly to get over that.
But Livingston continues to trouble visitors in playing the exact type of game they want, in which sequence the sweeps of their long ball Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's side could have only expanded in the final stages but McGregor had well pushed Jacobs before Lithgow could go wide from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another final prosecution for a penalty because Jacobs had crossed the line, but Thomson did not look again.
Almanac: The creator of the Geiger Counter
And now here's a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and PATULOUSLY WHAT WAS THE FIRST DAY ... the day Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany to be a physicist every day.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would later transport the device called the Geiger Counter.
A key part of science since then, Geiger Counter has also become a major support for pop culture, in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," featuring the seemingly unlucky cowboy scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to refer to radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these earphones, you actually hear the effects of atoms that radioactivity produces on the minerals."
Evans: "It's definitely sounding right now!"
"Hans" Geiger left in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention continued to be attached to his name.
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to "Determine" Damage Cells
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'specify' harmful cells and eliminate them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to identify harmful cells.
The procedure involves the removal of immune cells in the patient, and improving them in the laboratory.
Then they can make the protein 'determine' common in most cancers and then inject them back.
The test vaccine provides good results to patients with a variety of cancers.
For more than 18 months, ovarian cancer has disappeared from a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify harmful cells.
The procedure involves taking immune cells from a patient, and improving those in the laboratory to "refer" them to the protein common to most cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cells back.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: "Our findings indicate that we have a reliable vaccine."
HER2 "caused the spread of many types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explains Prof Berzofsky.
In the treatment of type leukemia the same method of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to break down cancer cells.
Kanye West joined the Pro-Trump Diatribe, Suit a MAGA Hat, after his release from the SNL.
The result was not good.
"Boo" starred Kanye West at the studio as he performed Saturday Night Live after a long performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for the position in 2020.
After performing his third song for that night, called Ghost Town where he wore Make America Great cap, he criticized Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"I've talked to white people many times and they say, 'How do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
If I remember about racism, I would have to leave America for a long time," he said.
SNL began the show in a kit featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star entertained Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee on Legal Disclosure regarding sexual advertising complaints made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the comedian Chris Rock uploaded the footage of West's bias on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock is trying to embarrass West in the post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was not blocked on the backstage about his hat.
"They put me on the backstage.
They said, ‘Don’t go out wearing ‘that’ hat.’
They're pissing me off!
And they say I'm in the wrong place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the sunken place?" when he said, he did the "I've been cheating on my own mate or superman, because that means you can't dictate what I should do. Do you want the world to grow?
Try to have love."
Due to his comments, the audience booed at least twice and the cast members of the SNL were embarrassed, according to Variety's report, and there was a person there who stated in the publication: "The whole studio is packed with silence."
West was inducted as a prosecuted purchase for singer Ariana Grande, who had lost her fiancé, rapper Mac Miller, just a few days ago.
Many are upset at West's performance of the song I Love It, where he wears as Perrier Bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner who tweeted: "For one of the strongest wills: SAFETY TO THE WORLDWIDE OF THE WORLDWIDE."
The host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was "just proving and without any wonder."
"So far I have chosen NOT to recognize a person (by buying music or his clothes or supporting his "art") who I think is trying and expressing the ideology associated with my community.
He has freedom.
And so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had purchased the name, and he now says he is "the formally recognized as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Both rappers Snoop Dogg are named after the former Snoop Lion and of course, the late musical legend Prince, who changed his name and became a symbol, and later became an artist formerly known as Prince.
A case of a gunshot wound in a restaurant in Belfast

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is the first to win the title
Kit Harington is best known for his character, Jon Snow, in the violinist medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, sharply prioritizes the stereotype of the brutal defender, according to him such roles on the screen lead to the frequent thinking of young men that they need to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed he had "made a mistake" and questioned how to address the problem of detrimental masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who was recently married to Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, also admitted that his desire to tackle the issue was 'satisfactory'.
"My personal preference for today - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, based on the problem we see today?"
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing detrimental masculinity due to its overwhelming characters.
He continued: "What is nature and what is being taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes young men think that they need to be this kind of man?
I think, ‘that’s really one of the biggest questions of our time – how can we change that?’
Because there's obviously something wrong with young men."
He also admitted in the interview that he would no longer make any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series is finished next summer, because he, 'has finished in the fields of war and cavalry'.
Starting in November, Kit will be featured in the re-release of True West by Sam Shepard's story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently announced that their acquaintance with his wife Rose was what he considered to be the best thing that ever happened in Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on the show that 'this, it has become the way in which I have a family in the future, and in which I will live from it,' he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, who liked Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won an Emmy award.
The two married in June 2018 in the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in the number of new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its people with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health officials.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases are passed through intercourse, marking a change from the past.
The spread of HIV in some parts of China is usually rapid due to transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials in a discussion in Yunnan province.
However, each year the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increases to 100,000 people.
A major issue in China's LGBT community is HIV addiction through sexual intercourse.
The illegality of homosexuality in China was denied in 1997, but it is still said to be widespread discrimination against LGBT members.
Because of the country's conservative estimates, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who had sex with a man were previously married to a woman.
Most of the discomforts in the diseases are caused by a lack of protections in intercourse with such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged public access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the issue.
Maxine Waters denies his staff that GOP senators' data has been disseminated, and insists on "controversial lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of his staff posted personal information of three Republican senators in the U.S. on Wikipedia pages for legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat insists that "ultra-right-wing" critics and websites plan the complaints.
"Lies, lies, and many more arms of lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
According to the report, along with the information released were home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was released online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill as a Senate panel hearing was taking place on charges of sexual immorality against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information came out a few minutes before the three senators examined Kavanaugh.
In Hill's report, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that Waters' office was linked to an IP address referring to the source of the posts and it provided information to Waters' staff member.
"It's all wrong and a lie is this unfounded accusation," Waters continued.
"My staff member - who compromised identity, personal information, and safety as a result of these misleading and misleading allegations - has nothing to do with the dissemination of this information.
This is a complete error and a lie that is unfounded."
Waters' statements were quickly streamlined online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"There's anger in rejecting it," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests that he does not have the necessary behavior of a Member of Congress.
When a man is accused of something he has not done, he should not be upset.
He shouldn't be a fighter.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
He needs to be calm and respectful."
Fleischer comes out condemning Waters' reaction to the Democrats' opposition to Judge Kavanaugh, who has been accused by critics of overly entertaining as the hearing takes place on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican running candidate for Waters' midterm election, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Stop if there's truth," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities regarding these misleading complaints.
"We will ensure that people who are actively engaged are identified," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their destructive and endangering activities for anyone and all members of my staff."
Johnny English Review Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson's Spy Poof
He is now usually looking for Brexit relevance in any new film in Britain and seems to fit it into the new version of Johnny English's action-comedy spoof franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and made a sound again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is it a new opportunity for the country to export the ridiculous use of self-loathing with the subject matter of how much our inconsistency is noticeable?
Despite all, Johnny English's big-eyed and tedious appearance without a buzzer has licensed to replay things a second time - more than anything else, indicating his name is a long-running comic made for places where fans don't speak English.
Of course, he was a vague secret agent who despite his curious assumptions of being a swab elegant had little character by Clouseau, who had Mr. Bean's and was overjoyed by the portion of the man who contributed a note to the Chariots of Fire singing theme for the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He was also originally based on the traveler and international mystery man played by Atkinson in the now-dispatched Barclaycard TV ads, where he caused confusion on his screen.
There are one or two beautiful scenes in JE's last show.
I liked Johnny English's approach to the helicopter as he wore a medieval boot and suddenly touched the rotor blades on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent is visible in physical laughter, but it has become ineffective and natural, especially since there is confidence now to add laughter as its element to the brands of "serious" movies such as 007 and Mission Impossible.
There was a previous joke that it was intended for children instead of those at the right age, and for me, Johnny English's comic strips were not as creative and clear-cut as the silent-movies that Atkinson brought to Bean's character.
The premise now long-experienced in the area is the placement of Great Britain in a difficult situation.
A cyber-hacker enters Britain's highly confidential web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, causing disillusionment with the agent responsible - a debilitating little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last thing to destroy the prime minister who is a high-ranking and generous person, who is already experiencing complete anxiety over the lack of human support for him in politics: Emma Thompson tries to perform on this terribly-Therese-May character but is not too pressurized from the script.
His intelligence advisers warned him that since all the active spies had compromised, he had to be returned from the retired.
And that refers to the school-school-owned Johnny English himself, who is now working as a principal teacher at an exclusive institution, but gives private lessons on how to be an undercover operative: funny ‘it’s, because English gives a bad-School of Rock academy to play.
English was immediately summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and he met again with former long-distance sidekick Bough, who was replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicki Pepperdine is slightly injured.
Batman and Robin are back in action to win the fights in His Majesty's Secret Service, and they can play the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister delicately fell into the attraction of the charismatic tech billionaire who says he can solve Britain's computer mess: the bad-ass Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough have already begun in their long adventures of crazy receptions: pretending waiters, they started a fire at an expensive French restaurant; they made a scene to ride involuntaryly on Volta's luxurious yacht family; and English began a vast headache when he tried to use a Virtual set.
There's nothing to be done about that last sequence, but even if it's exciting and expensive, there's a chance of being a TV show as a whole.
Not very big things.
And I can't stop myself thinking about other Johnny English movies: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that could bring justice to his talent?
Labour says it plans to have four days of work in a week for Britons but will be paid the equivalent of five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan to have the Britons four days a week working - but they will be paid the equivalent of five days.
According to the party, the company's bosses want to pass on those saved in a major change in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra rest day.
This will give employees the opportunity to have a three-day weekend - but they will still be able to return the same wage.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and plans to benefit the country's workers would be 'refused'.
The Trades Union Congress endorsed the four-day shift in a week's work as a way to give workers an opportunity in a changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "The announcement of the policy review is expected before the end of the year.
"It can't be done one night but the four days a week work is a challenge to the party's methodology to rebalance the economy for the benefit of the workers and also for the general approach in the party industry."
The Labour Party was not the first to endorse such an idea, as the Green Party had promised to work four days a week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at present the Labour Party has not endorsed this petition in its entirety.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: 'The party does not have a four-day working week policy and the party does not consider it.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used Labour's discussion last week to better explain his dream of a revolutionary socialism in the economy.
According to Mr. McDonnell, he was prosecuted to withdraw power from "unseen directors" and "man who is exposing the pipe" to utility companies.
It also means in the shadow chancellor plans that current shareholders in water companies may not get the full share of their stake because the Labour government may impose 'reductions' for particularly wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and to fund Inclusive Ownership Funds that will provide 10 percent of the equity of private sector companies to employees, which will have annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" if they could change their minds on the FBI investigation to Kavanaugh
Due to the FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett, the last vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court was denied by no less than a week, and there was a question as to whether the department's findings would cause Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview held on Sunday, the "60 Minutes", correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was anything from the possible FBI discoveries that could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes," said Kennedy.
"I told you when I went to the hearing, I said I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened ‘this, after the accusation came out, I said, ‘Did you do this?’
He's full of courage, determination, and no rest."
However, Graham's vote does not seem to change.
"I've been thinking about Brett Kavanaugh and a big charge will be needed for it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this is what I know: Brett refused it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And it doesn't confirm all the people he's named.
It's been 36 years.
I didn't see any change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a hugely amazing line-up of stars performing and a similar wonderful mission; the end of the world's poverty.
In its seventh year this year, the Global Citizen Festival will host thousands of people to gather in the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy acts such as the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to have knowledge for the real purpose of the event.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert attendees must complete a range of activities, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, calling on the phone or any other means.
But how successful is the Global Citizen now with only 12 years left before it reaches its goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert to admire people who encourage action or just add it to the so-called "clickivism" - people feel they can make a real change by signing an online petition or tweeting?
As of 2011, Global Citizen said it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, encouraging the host of a variety of purposes.
Its language, these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to advertise provisions and ensure the equivalent of more than <0x24>37 billion that could make a difference in the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the early part of 2018, the group mentioned 390 provisioning and advertising came from its operation, and at least <0x24>10 billion of these were spent or used for fundraising.
The group estimates that insured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main providers include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers in the U.S. that aims to "help children grow to discover their full potential," promising to give Rwanda <0x24>25,000 million to help end global malnutrition after 4 years.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make footnotes that the social injustice in nutritional deficiencies are only in history," Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, said in a statement to London live audiences in 2018.
According to the group, after more than 5,000 U.K. calls for nutrition to be based on mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and youth through methods for nutrition.
In response to one of the FAQs on its website asking the question "how do you think we can cope with the overwhelming difficulties?"
The Global Citizen replied: "It's going to be a long and difficult road - sometimes, we'll crash and fail.
But like the predecessors of us who have a great civil rights movement and an anti-black-to-black separation policy, we will succeed, because we are stronger when we are together.
With Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe at their event this year in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy for "traffic mass" to hinder Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington could "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russia's energy transfer to the market, including the Middle East, said U.S. Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's contact with Syria - particularly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - was only a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to be energy brokers like they do in the eastern part of Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, the facilities, to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group which sees itself as a "stop energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying that they are just the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, about a dozen, to benefit and exchange energies," he said, while saying that "Russia has only one thing to do" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These talks come out as the Trump administration promotes its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, which buys Russia, the far cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
To achieve this, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are attempting to convince Germany to stifle the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, is why Moscow has become "controlled" Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to dumoble the current capacity of the pipeline to be 110 billion cubic meters, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin claimed that Washington's strong opposition to the project was only fueled by economic reasons and an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we both have the same view that energy cannot be used as a tool to force and that suppliers should be able to choose consumers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S.'s view of Germany was strongly reacting, confirming its stance on the project.
The US has called on Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"The problem is great when other states are familiar with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"Considering Good" by Elizabeth Warren to run for president in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that it was "considerably good" to run the presidency following the midterm elections.
In a speech in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and arrange our next government and this includes a woman as president," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I'm really thinking about running the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump in such a speech, saying "this country is taking the wrong direction.
"I'm really concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our economy," he said.
Warren has been criticized for criticizing Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's subjects were not convinced that he should run in 2020.
Eighty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent are in favor of this type of operation.
The sarbey showed more support for the run by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting the possible run and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democrats discussed in connection with a possible 2020 run by former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq, after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"While my son is on his way back, I understand other families who have experienced the results of PTSD and some of the feelings our soldiers have brought on their return," he told audiences at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a big problem not to talk" and said that his son and other war veterans "returned a little bit differently, they would return to violence, asking if there was any respect for the country of their fellow soldiers and pilots."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was abused by domestic violence, particularly by women's injuries, interfered in reporting domestic violence and possession of guns while lying, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supported the issue of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have supported the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that demands asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the friend-of-the-court district briefed Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is questioning policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the defendant in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
He said his partner had abused him "and his children a member of the violin gang," but U.S. officials rejected his request for asylum on July 20.
He was born in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are the source of a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals allowing undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, District of Columbia Attorney General, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy was "distorting many decades of state, federal, and world law."
"The federal law provides that all asylum claims are punishable on the basis of particular facts and events of the prosecution, and such prohibition violates such a principle," said the friend-of-the court brief.
Attorneys in the brief also argued that the policy warming the entry of immigrants is inclusive of the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become businessmen and "support the need for the worker."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing family abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is for refugees in their country of origin due to persecution or fear that is due to race, religion, nationality, or being a member of a particular social group or a political opinion," Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum has never been provided to solve all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate attempts to recover from Palu as the number of deaths to recover survivors doubled
For the survivors, the situation worsened.
"Extremely cancerous," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her baby boy in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance arrives with a body.
There is a shortage of clean water."
Residents are seen returning to their lost homes, collecting their baggage, trying to recover whatever they see.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals have been evacuated, injuring by magnitude 7.5 earthquakes.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a back and shoulder spine, rested outside the Army Hospital of Palu, where patients were being treated outside due to an ongoing strong aftershock.
Tears filled his eyes as he talked about how the intense earthquake felt in the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where his wife and daughter were staying.
"We don't have time to save ourselves.
I was pushed to the wall that was falling 'that'," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city to attend a crime.
"I heard my wife ask for help, after nothing, quietly.
I don't know what happened to him and his son.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "scary" using "advertising propaganda"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published four-page advertising in a U.S. newspaper praising the benefits of U.S.-China power, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. newspaper to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump cited Wednesday's paid statement to the Des Moines Register - the most widespread newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of interfering in the election for the U.S. congress on Nov. 6, a charge China denied.
Trump's allegation of Beijing's attempt to mediate in the U.S. election has become a hindrance to what U.S. officials have told Reuters a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to stifle China.
While it is normal for governments from other countries to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a growing trade war in which they have exchanged tips on each other's imports.
China's first-stage trade ties are designed to attract exporters to states such as Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, experts in China and the U.S. say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion column in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China, "is now emphasizing the shock by publishing advertising propaganda in our own free newspaper."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the cherished American tradition of free speech and free speech by publishing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"While in the newspaper stores here in Beijing, you will see only limited voices of opposition and you will not see a real picture of the divergent opinions of the Chinese about the disturbing direction of China's economy, because the Chinese Communist Party holds tight in the media," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China has abstained from the offer to publish" this article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans pushed women voters away before Midterms due to Kavanaugh's turmoil, Tagasuri's Warnings
While many major Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of some allegations of sexual abuse, investigators warn that they will face intense reactions, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions about it are quite intense, and most of the created Republicans see that they want to continue voting.
Those things cannot be ignored," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that he would be sufficiently supportive of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the FBI's investigation to appease angry voters.
"Women can't forget what happened yesterday - they can't forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the modern MoveOn group, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is approaching!" as they rallyed in the Senate hallway because Republicans with control of the Committee on Information chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic motivation and motivation will be unusual," said Stu Rothenberg, an undisclosed political analyst on the news site.
"People say it's high; it's true.
But it can go further, especially with swing voters in out-of-town polling stations and voters, about 18- to 29-year-olds, who often don't vote, although they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against the nominee in the Supreme Court, investigators say there could be a strong reaction if the Republicans continue the confirmation.
"This has become a big mistake for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Republican Committee, last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee or the election or if Kavanaugh is defeated, it's also about how Republicans handle this debate and how they treat him," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, explained in a news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans are coming out with a split on who believes in Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with fewer confrontation in the end.
A new survey from YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents were certain or likely to believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they were certain or likely to believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied to his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford as well as at least another accused, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford pleaded before the Senate Judiciary Committee after sworn last week that he was abused by the rapist Kavanaugh when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the nominee showed him his king while they were at a party while they were still studying at Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor of the World Wide Web Plan to Launch a New Internet to Fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology legend project, is a company created from Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and what people will be allowed to access for what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee remarked that the purpose behind the Inrupt was to "occupy the whole world."
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
Contact lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored here.
For this, Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online data store is fully controlled by the user who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "self-enforcement through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to bring the company techniques, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to all people.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several on-staff developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to release a complete change in which all of their business models would be completely reversed overnight.
"We didn't ask for their permission."
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission (the Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built based on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
While Inrupt was launched, Berners-Lee remains Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very positive for this next season on the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Clergy wins Victoria Cross in WW1 celebrated
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross in World War I as a warrior was celebrated in his town 100 years later.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But, he was killed by a sniper four days later and he never knew he had won Britain's highest military honour.
A guard stone was removed by his two grandparents at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said he was "a brilliant symbol" to expose the stone exactly 100 years from his grandfather's glorious work.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918 Lt. Col Vann led his battalion crossing the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very heavy storm as bullets from fields and machine guns rained."
He then went on to the first row and led the row forward with the "highest leverage" before starting using a field-gun and hitting the three of the team together.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can't watch but something humiliating."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also dedicated the flower bouquet after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "names will be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of the real hero is shown by the support that many people will give."
MMA fans don't sleep at night to watch Bellator 206, but Peppa Pig is what they watch
Think about it, you woke up at night to watch the counter Bellator 206 but you weren't allowed to watch it.
The bill from San Jose contains 13 matches, including six on the main card and broadcast live throughout the UK on Channel 5.
Around 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepare for their presentation, UK viewers were surprised when the coverage changed and became Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed when they got up to an easy day for the fight.
A Twitter fan has said "it looks like a bad bureau" to move the cartoon wall.
"Government policy that at 6 a.m. is unable to watch such a show so they have to move to the main show," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the pig, yeah."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would arrange their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about replay, maybe we can fix it," Coker said.
"But it's Sunday morning and we can't fix it until Sunday with them, Monday with them.
But we're fixing it.
Believe me, when they moved there, a lot of repetitive texts and all of them angry.
We were trying to fix it, but we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it has to do with the government.
I can promise that this will not happen next time.
We're only going to do five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we're trying to give the fans but we're over.
It was just a problem."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Humbled' Due to Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said that he grew up feeling lower than others because of his sexuality - but that's what will make him successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't think until he got to high school that "not everyone is like him."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs printed by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that parenting has reduced his desire to win the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to the illness.
Releasing as a castaway on Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "lower" than others as she grew up because "it's not easy for society to accept the likes of both men and women."
He said: "Until now, those feelings that I am less, and feel that I am different, are the real things that have given me the strength to succeed."
She tried to prove that "he was different," she said, so she didn't hide everything when they learned about her sexuality later.
Twice winning the bronze medal at the Olympics became a high-profile campaigner for LGBT and used his release at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries where homosexuality is a crime.
She said she spoke because she felt worthy of being able to live without consequences and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that he loved a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "I was surprised."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him, last year but said he never had a problem with the age gap.
"When you're very young" - he first joined the Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer after three years - he said it was difficult to find a man who had experienced both happiness and sadness.
The couple became parents in June, with their son Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "whole view" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, all that matters is, 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there's something more important than gold medals at the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son's name was his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept him to die and one of his last questions was whether they had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front seat.
"I can't tell him you're not going to sit in front of me, Dad," he said.
"I held her hand when she stopped breathing and only then she really didn't breathe and she was really dead that I didn't get her unconscious," she said.
The following year Daley fought at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I know that's what I've dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of the people of the Olympic Games, nothing feels better," he said.
It also inspired her first chosen song - Heather Small's Pride - to surprise her at the upcoming Olympics and still build her sister-in-law.
Desert Island Discs are on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson was not in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set the record on Sunday when he plays in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he needs to fix his condition to prevent it from becoming a sad event.
Mickelson, who played in the biennial event for the record 12th time, was dismissed by captain Jim Furyk for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as is often the case for him for the United States, the major winner splits five times his time between being a cheerleader and training in the range, hoping to rectify anything wrong with him.
Since he has never been the most direct driver even during his career, the 48-year-old is not fit for the tight Le Golf National course, where the wrong shots in the long rough often have problems.
And as if the difficult course wasn't enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth match, faced British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of them this week.
If the Americans, who lost four points starting in 12 singles matches, would start hot, Mickelson's match could be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, because he had nothing else to say.
"He fully understood his role today, stabbed me in the back and walked me and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great self-confidence.
Hall of Fame has been and has many added to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't want him to play two games.
I had more dreams, but that's what happened and that's what we thought we were going to.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson broke Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup match on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the Ryder Cup race that never matched his highest individual record.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 goals, and seven goals, though Furyk said that his presence brought some unseen benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, smart, he likes to talk to people, and he's good with the team room," she explains.
"I think the younger players are also enjoying him, this week, and it's fun to watch.
It's more than he can play."
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows he's about to lose the big one
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows, based on the experience, that only major singles in the last day of the Ryder Cup could easily be lost and that this fight could be uncomfortable.
Denmark started in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros as captain held only five points against the Americans but declined to reach the finish line due to very little margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You always remind yourself that we're only big in Valderrama; we're only big in Brookline, and we're defeated there, and in Valderrama, we're winning, but we're down," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday at the National Golf 10th.
So history will show me and all that team that it's not over yet.
You'll give it all tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It's not finished until you can put the points on the board.
We have achieved our goal, and that's the attempt to win this trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I've said before, I'll focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what's on the other side - the best player in the world."
Glad to play his players on the difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't lead myself here.
It's open to other lights.
Open individual performances are visible, and other activities are there.
It's nice to go out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone there, the limits of your ability as a golfer can be tested.
That's the message you need to understand to the players, delivering everything you can open tomorrow.
Now, leave your partner and he'll have to go and get everything out of him."
Compared to Bjorn, the opposing number Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better as individuals than as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of a major shift on the last day, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before Europe defeated the "Miracle and Medina."
"I remember every word here," he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When heading in one direction the buoleo ‘yes, it brings a lot of pressure in the midfield matches.
We're doing our line-up as needed and we're putting out the players because, you know, we're trying to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to lead the winning game and faced Rory McIlroy in the top match, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter other Europeans half-up the line-up.
"This is what I've done with this group of players because I think it's the best so far," Bjorn told his selections for singles.
Germany's new warship has been postponed
Germany's latest frigate should have been set to buy old warships since the Cold War, but it will not happen until next year due to system defects and rising costs, local media reports.
Dedicated to "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit diary mentioned in a military spokesman's statement.
The ship should have been included in the Navy in 2014, but the big project was in trouble due to serious issues after it was delivered.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by the old Bremen-class frigates.
Obviously they have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer storage period - it is possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continued delay means that the latest warships - which are said to allow Germany to show power overseas - will become obsolete when the time comes to put them into service," said Die Zeit.
The news headlined the lucky F125 frigate last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and return it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the manufacturer after it was delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited some "defects of critical software and hardware" that led to the warship being deployed in a combat mission.
Software deficiencies are more important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew consisting of 120 passengers - only half of the worker of the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, the ship came out too heavy to reduce its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Palatinate" is believed to be twice as heavy as the same ship types used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1bn (<0x24>3.6bn) - up from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2bn.
Problems surrounding the latest frigates are becoming more important due to recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is shrinking.
In the first part of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy was indeed "deployed by ships that could still be deployed."
The official said the issue had grown over time, as the old ships were removed but no purchased ships were given.
He pointed out that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were involved in the Navy.
The National Trust is committed to protecting the lives of the poor
The purpose of the new research carried out outside a estate in the Scottish Highlands is to explore how panics use the scenery in their search for food.
It is expected to clarify the behavior of the different flying mammals and help guide future care activities.
Scientists' study at the National Trust for Scotland followed common and soprano pipstrelles as well as the brownish long-eared panic and Daubenton panic in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Place special recorders at the main locations around the property to track the activities of the scaffolds throughout the time.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Experts in sound analysis at all recordings will confirm the frequency of panicworms and which species makes which sound.
Then, make a residential map to have a more detailed landscape-scale description of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, expects the results to reveal which habitat areas are most important to the panics and how each species uses them.
This information can help to find out the benefits of residential management activities such as the creation of the area and what is the best way to preserve forests for panics and other related species.
The panic population has been largely reduced in Scotland and throughout the UK over the past century.
They are threatened by the construction and development work that affects predators and homelessness.
Wind-powered turbines and lights can also pose a risk, as well as flypapers and some chemicals treated with building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The pancakes are not really blind.
However, because of their hunting at night, their ears are more helpful than their eyes when it comes to catching the squirrel.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to identify insects and rodents on the path they are spreading.
The NTS panics, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land nationwide, are important.
It has been trained by experts, who regularly carry out surveys, inspected rodents and at times were recalls.
The organization even established the first and only preserved reserve land for the spider in Scotland on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten spider species in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the best territory for them.
"We've got a good place to stay in the woods," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of wooden veterans and all of the beautiful residences.
But there's so much we don't know about panics, so what we're doing here and with other properties can help to understand more about what they need to survive."
He acknowledged the importance of inspecting if there were panics before carrying out maintenance within properties because it is possible to accidentally destroy even a single mother's womb could kill 400 women and boys, which could possibly wipe out the entire local population.
Panics are protected and are unlawfully violated to kill, mutilate or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Scotland's Bat Conservation Trust official Elisabeth Ferrell was encouraged to assist the public.
He said: "We have a lot to learn about our species and we don't know the status of the population of many of our species."
Ronaldo ignores allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to file a case against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the charges of rape against him "a horror news," saying some people "would like to mention themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are scheduled to refer to the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward accused of rape of American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have paid the woman <0x24>375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
While talking to an Instagram Live video of his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, Ronaldo, 33, said the reports were "horrible news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
"It's a bad news," he told the camera that he won the Ballon d'Or five times.
"They want to use their own name.
It's normal.
They wanted to be smart so my name was mentioned, but it was just a job.
"I'm a very happy person and everything's fine," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for allegations, which they called "an unacceptable reporting of suspects in the field of privacy," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will be prosecuted for "moral damage in proportion to the burden of entry, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped the woman, according to the papers presented to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo fell down after the alleged incident and told him that "99 percent" was "a nice man" hidden by "one percent."
Documents claiming Ronaldo had confirmed the two had returned, but they both did so.
Mayorga also said that he went to the police and the picture caused his injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an arrangement because he was "afraid of revenge" and worried "of shame to the public."
The 34-year-old says he is now seeking to reverse the arrangement because he continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged abuse, and this summer moved to Italian giant Juve on a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK's 'life-saving regrets' about the loss of vehicle manufacturers
The UK's "lifetime regret" if it loses its status as the world's leading vehicle manufacturing company after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal it would temporarily reduce production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer of the vehicle said the effect of a delay at the border if no agreement on Brexit could lead to the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year and 90% of these were exported to other parts of the European Union.
"I think if Britain leaves the US at the end of March, production at our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK vehicle manufacturers have released their concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what vehicle manufacturers say risks to the supply chain should there be no agreement on Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for vehicles made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a border interference that the industry says could lead to delays and shortcomings of the parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's worth of invention at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relationships with the US was "deeply designed to avoid such border investigations."
"We need to have a deal. We want the best deal that will allow not only to experience success at the moment but to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"Based on the evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, we need to fully continue any very successful supply chain team."
Toyota cannot say how long production will be halted, but has warned that in the long run, additional costs can reduce the plant's ability to compete and will eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked for 24 years at Burnaston and is a Unite union contractor at the plant, said that his members' concerns are heightened: "In my experience, in the moment of loss, these jobs cannot be returned.
A spokesman for the government said: "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the US."
Trump and Rosenstein's speech could be delayed again, according to the White House
Donald Trumpat's very important meeting of deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed again another week" as the issue continues with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, according to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interference in the election, relations between Trump and Russia's aides and possible obstruction of the president to justice.
It took months to discuss whether Trump would torture the deputy attorney general, and if so, Mueller's independence would be at risk.
In the early part of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had attacked the wire wear to record their Trump talks and the possibility of resigning the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday, which was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not arrest Rosenstein" but delayed the meeting to avoid the opposition hearing of the Senate jury committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI's one-off investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, which was further delayed in the Senate's full voting.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders came out on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "There is no scheduled date for it, maybe this week, maybe it will be postponed another week because of all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
"We've been watching and I've always been up to date with the news."
Some reporters have objected to what he said: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the While House since September 10.
The host asked Chris Wallace why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to the dislike of TV reporters, though he said: "I don't think they really are."
He then pointed out that there was a lot of direct relationship between Trump and the press.
"The president makes more Q&A sessions than his predecessors," he said, adding without any aforementioned evidence: "We're looking at these numbers."
There will be briefings, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States itself, it's better than talking to me.
"We've tried to do it a lot and you've seen we've done it a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace the press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly receives questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
In New York this week the president may have shown why, in a demonstration of lack of formality and sometimes stunning appearances in front of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The U.S. Secretary of Health wrote to staff working for Scotland's NHS to express their gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter today with less than six months left until the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has promised to grant the amount of applications for settled status for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman said: "Last summer, talks between the UK and the US on the withdrawal continued, hoping there will be decisions this fall.
But the UK Government also stressed its preparations for a possible lack of agreement.
I know this is an exciting time for all of you.
I would like to reiterate the importance of each individual's profession to me, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
"Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie Sumailim in Emergency Operation After Acquiring Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie in emergency surgery after having suffered head injury in the defeat on Saturday 31-27 at Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ from Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred a few moments before the half-time.
"He went to the sideline and just fell there," Reed said.
Abercrombie was given oxygen by trainers and medical staff on the sideline before he was placed on the stretcher and taken for additional evacuation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type/range of injury" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out where the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore red shirt, was in her first season in Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season to a total of 18 tackles.
Foreign purchases of property in the UK are subject to higher stamp duty
Encourage foreigners to buy higher stamp duty when they purchase property in the UK and use additional money to help the unemployed under the new Tory plans
The move is counter to Corbyn's desire to attract young voters
Increase the tax burden on non-taxpayers in the UK
Kabang-Yaman expects it to raise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually - to help the sick
Foreigners are set to buy higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - and will use the extra money to help the sick, Theresa May announces it today.
The move will be seen as a counterpart to Jeremy Corbyn's desire to attract voters to pledges to provide affordable housing and to counteract large-scale earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be revealed to individuals and companies not paying tax in the UK, and will use additional money to support the Government's desire to resolve street sleep.
The surcharge - in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher level implemented two years ago in secondary residences and houses purchased for rent - may be up by 3%.
Kabang-Yaman expects this move to impact up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of London's new-founded properties are bought by non-residents in the UK, which raises prices if buyers make it harder to buy a house for the first time.
Many wealthy places in the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because many foreigners buy out of the country most of the time.
The new policy comes out just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the stamp duty to help young people at the right age to buy their first home.
He criticized the large construction company for the continued high price of the property by buying the land but it was not used, and urged Mrs May to raise quotas on rented houses to fix the "fair housing" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and termination of dismissals "without reason".
He also wants to give the councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would provide my prime ministership in bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing the problem of the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and live in it.
However, it is not so easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based in other countries, to buy homes such as the low-income British resident.
Too many people dream of having a home, and the inequality of sleeping on the street continues to be a real problem."
Jack Ross: "My ambition is the government of Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ambition above all" is to become Scotland's governor by the time the day comes.
Scot, 42, appreciates the challenge of reinstating the North-East club, currently in third place in League One, three points away from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after transferring St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid, and it always seemed like someone was calling me back.
That's the only way I'll get the chance to win the club."
Among the predecessors to Ross as Sunderland's governor were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow the characters known as the name of such a great club, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me right now is based on 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it has no doubt been included in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I might just say that I'm going to be successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross was only three years in his governing career, after becoming assistant boss at Dumbarton and being part of Hearts' coaching staff for 15 months.
Subsequently, he assisted Alloa to recover from the downside to the third level, and changed St Mirren from the downside to winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross said he feels more comfortable now than before when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"He's probably going to die," he recalled, referring to the rule of the Alliance.
"I really believe that I have the right to rule, more than to play.
It seemed to me that the game was good, I lived here, and enjoyed the fun of the moment.
But it's hard to play.
There are a lot of things you need to do every week.
I’m still struggling with the stresses and pressures at work, but management is the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to be the leader and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt in my entire life as at the right age."

According to the sarbey, Saturday 5:30pm is the best time for a pint
The hot summer has increased the sales of hardcore pubs in Britain but has brought more pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales of pubs and bars rose by 2.7 percent in July - but sales in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, based on figures.
Peter Martin of CGA's business consultancy who gathered the numbers said: "The continued sunrise and the longer duration of England's expected World Cup participation meant that July followed what happened in June, when pub sales rose by 2.8 percent, but restaurants were stronger.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurants sales in June increased in July.
The sale of pub and bar drinks is the strongest of the main goods, and when compared to the two seasons, they are higher than the lowered by restaurants.
The effect of summertime on pub food is also not good, although it is not the same as what restaurant operators are trying to do.
People just want to get out and drink.
In the pub and bar governments, sales of beverages rose by 6.6 percent for the month, and food sales fell by three percent."
Paul Newman of RSM leisure and hospitality analysts said: "These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or reinforcing events remains the biggest factor affecting the market share of those outside their homes.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups are still struggling, and a 4.8 percent drop in sales each year will be more painful when it is added to the ongoing pressure on spending.
It's not a good time for long hot summers for food operators and only time can tell if the situation will get better with the arrival of the warmer temperatures we experience in August."
The total increase in sales to pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a slowdown in brand releases.
The industry sales tracker Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK's pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined revenue of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and it is the established industry base.

A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in "fake Insta" accounts - referring to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news highlighted the fears of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they have a clean "main" account that is shown to parents, while they also have private accounts.
A mother who accidentally saw her 13-year-old son on the secure site encountered a teenager who was urging other people to "love me."
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of approximately 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of these admitted that they had private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that too many teens are attracted to creating online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle to be "votes for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the government branch.
Doyle is Scotland's track and field athlete with the most winning and leader Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for gamers to benefit from his extensive world-class experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect for the sports communities in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are sure that Scotland's athletics will greatly benefit from bringing him on board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm interested in standing up as the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help get the game going in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta with his total four golds at the Olympics and is now a regular expert on the BBC, did not walk after having a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "It's been a month since I had a stroke.
I didn't walk.
The doctors only told me when I was pregnant or at what level.
It was hard work but I recovered completely, I learned how to walk again and now I'm exercising to be relaxed!
Thank you for your heartfelt messages!"
Read online opinion on advertising for breast pump where mothers are punished for cows
The breast pump company has split the opinion on the internet due to advertising in which mothers are being punished for breastfeeding cows.
To mark the launch of what they say is "the first silently worn breast bump around the world," Elvie company released a fun-looking sarcastic like music video advertisement to showcase the freedom the new pump gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a bar full of strawberries with a play with lyrics such as: "Yes, I'm curling myself but you can't see the ass" and "If you haven't noticed those 'heads', my breasts 'that."
The choir continued, "I'll take you, I'll take you, I'll take you, I'll take you, I'll take you, I'll take you, I'll take you, I'll take you, I'll take you, I'll take you, I'll take you."
Advertising, which has already been posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the internet.
There have been 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, and the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it outweighs the "horrible" in the dairy industry.
"It's really not a good decision to use cows to advertise the product.
As we need them to conceive and give birth to milk, so their supplies are only a few days away from birth," said one.

Another commented: "It's traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why don't they use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who aren't far from their babies?"
He added: "There's no publicity.
Others defended the advertisement, admitting that the song was "laughing" to her.
"This is an idea for me.
I would have bought it if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like I was pumping.
Advertising has changed a bit, but I think it does.
"This is a product," one said.
Another comment: "It's fun advertising for mothers who pump (often in their jobs or cubes) and feel like "cows."
It's not advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they are all dancing with inappropriate pumps inside their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many dairy pumping women say they feel for cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, with no wires or tubes and folds inside the nursing bra indiscriminately, so women are more mobile, they are easier to relieve their babies, and can even come out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: "The Elvie Pump has brought a big change so it just needs to give it a bold and exciting launch.
Compared to pumping ladies and cows we wanted to draw attention to the pumping of milk and all the hard things about it, while showing in a fun and early-to-be-understood way the great comfort brought by the new pump.
This is not the first time Elvie pump has become head of the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother with two-year-old son was sworn in for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrants Silently Moved to a Tent Camp in Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has increased even though the monthly crossing at the border remains unchanged, partly because it has made it harder for children to be placed on sponsors as a result of harsh rhetoric and policies implemented by the Trump administration.
Typically, most of the sponsors have also become undocumented immigrants, and are afraid that their own ability to remain in the country would be hindered when they receive a child.
The risk increased this June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other senior members of their household would have to submit fingerprints, and share the data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was indicted in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people applying to sponsor uninvolved children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no previous criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of individual sponsors or family members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and most of them are criminal aliens.
So we continue to throw out such individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order for children to be processed more quickly, officials have enforced new policies that will comply with their court hearings within a month of cadetization, rather than 60 days, which was the former standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will come forward via video conference call, rather than in person, to explain their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Decisions that are not eligible for help are quickly deported.
The longer children are in the habit, the more likely they are to become brittle or sad, which may lead to extreme anger or attempted escape, according to shelter workers and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
The supporters said that those obstacles were stronger in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is suffering are likely to be ignored, due to its size.
They add that moving children to a tent city without giving enough time to prepare for their emotions or to inform friends can be a reminder of the trauma many have experienced.
"Occupied forces" of the US, France and Turkey have been told by Syria to leave immediately
During the UN General Assembly talks, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even in the eighth year of the country's war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the stay of foreign forces in the country of Syria was illegal, blamed for the counter-terrorism, and that it was "to be faced as appropriate."
"They have to leave immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the fight against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more need to be removed from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight the sacred battle until the removal of both terrorist groups and "any foreign presence that violates the law" in all territory of Syria.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that are fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were fine, and he criticized "some Western countries" for "spreading unjust fear" that prompted refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the global community and charitable organizations to delay these returns," he said.
"They're going to have a full-fledged discussion."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for reconstruction for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
In the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russia's assistance on the province, where three million people live, was avoided.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal had "clear borders" and expressed hopes that military action would counteract jihadists including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which he would "destruct."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of the government and members of the opposition will be held to write the basic post-war law for Syria and delay the election.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, and said the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and warns against intervention.
Why Trump wins the second term
In that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again except, as many liberal spectators might expect, if his presidency is to end early in the crackdown and scandal.
In the words of "The most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
Currently, there are no signs of fatigue for spectators.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have increased more than double to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly triple to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million premiere-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the cable ratings in the 3.5 million audience on major news nights.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because we don't understand it," said Neal Baer, who runs the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," about a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol was destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has a different theory.
He recalled riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he was going to beat Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because he laughed at me,'" Mrs. Scovell said to me.
The turmoil is alarming.
Of course, unlike the other on TV, stories originating in Washington could affect the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families reunite again, and the health of the global economy.
The one who doesn't listen is a luxury that can only be done by the richest spectator.
But beyond being a wise citizen Trump when you've been six hours watching the panel of experts who debated Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" sourcing for his book "Fear," in which Paul Manafort's <0x24>15,000 bomber jacket, says The Stormych's "and Daniel's storm."
If only I could see it, it would be different from Super Mario.
"Part of what he does if it's for this reality show is because he's being presented to you night-by-night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's spin-off show and the day-to-day change in the story.
You will be missed if you pass an epidemic.
When I mentioned Mr. Fleiss this week, it was roughly 80 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC as CNN recorded.
He did not leave the show, especially Brett Kavanaugh was scheduled to appear on the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court's future was suspended.
"I noticed when we were doing the funny shows and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a bit of a bug, but they were right."

Money from outside sinks into Congress's strongest fight in midterm elections
It's no surprise that cash flows in Pennsylvania's 17th, thanks to the change in congressional districts that resulted in the opposition of two current seats for the same position.
It has only recently fought the Pittsburgh district's reorganized Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won a position in another district in a special election in the spring.
Lamb is running against another currently-seated Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently the representative of the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is actually endorsed by the new 17th.
The maps were re-drawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's ruling in January that the former districts were manipulating in violation of the basic law in favor of Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th started a fight for campaign funding between the main party-led branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after winning very little in a special election in March that was watched by many for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The Republican held that position for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little bit.
U.S. Penalties in El Salvador for China's Support, Then Retreat
Diplomats claim that the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a good meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners encouraged the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to return U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, in a statement earlier this month.
But only penalties against El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, were taken into account, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including financial aid cuts and targeted visa restrictions, would have been very painful for the Central American country and the high level of unemployment and death there.
As internal meetings are based, North American and Central American officials have postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic development to follow the same-sex meeting in a year that has been deemed a step forward towards halting migration.
But by mid-September, the senior administration official made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, ending with any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, to be held in mid-October, as a sign of the administration's appreciation for the meeting, diplomats said.
And quietly returned the three American envoys to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a new strict message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal talks on the condition that they would not be named.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outgoing inspector close to the administration and also spoke to the condition that he would not be named.
Learning the History.
The next event will be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstructions to justice, with now much evidence in the public record.
According to the report, Mr. Mueller is now reverting his investigation into whether Trump's campaign against Russia has agreed to attack our election.
If the holder of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face responsibility for this branch, as he prepares to run for re-election, and perhaps later face a jury made up of his loyalties.
There's a lot of that, and I don't say that Mr. Trump's fall - or his loyalties to Europe.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic will make many decisions that will affect how long the habit lasts.
In 1938, the Germans were ready to make an official coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West would have defeated him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and the chance to avoid the next three years is over.
The course of history has been involved in such points of change of direction, and the rapid progress of democracy has been accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing some of the points of this change now.
What would we do if Mr. Trump raped Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been prevented from starting when this district reported that, last year, he secretly proposed a record for the president and even gave speculation that the president was inappropriate for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' account is inaccurate.
"How do we respond if the F.B.I.'s new request for investigation to Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?"
And above all, will we vote in midterms for a Congress that will answer Mr. Trump?
If we fall into those trials, the winter of democracy will last.
But I believe that we will not fall, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my home as an ambassador.
He survived, went to America and, 60 years later, illuminated the Sabbath candles on that swastika-marked table.

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic about upcoming match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following Spain's stunning table against Villarreal in the first half of this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury stopped midfielder Graham Dorrans out of the season up to 2-2 goals in Villarreal but he believed the Rangers could use that result as a boost to bigger points.
"This is a good point for us because Villarreal has a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game that we thought we could get something and get out with points.
We may have been able to get it in the end, but overall, the table may have been a good result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
On Thursday, it was a big night in Europe.
I hope we get three points but the game will be difficult because they have a good result in their last game, but the people have supported us, so I'm sure we will fight and get a positive result.
"Last year was really hard, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself but there's a good feeling in the area today.
The team was good and the members really enjoyed it; the training was good.
We hope that we can fight now, win the last season and be successful."
Women's rights have been violated due to fear of retirement.
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, only a few people are talking to their family members about it.
Approximately half of the nationwide study individuals say they are talking to their wives about the value of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to take care of them by a family member, but they are not taking steps to talk," said Holly Snyder, vice president of business at Nationwide life insurance.
Here it can start.
Talk to your wife and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't tell your wishes early.
Talk to your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, because these decisions will be of great value.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help you meet these expenses or insure yourself with your own money - if you have money.
Organize your legal documents: Try to avoid legal problems.
Have a proxy for health care so that you can assign a trusted individual to manage your medical care and make sure that professionals follow your wishes if you are unable to speak.
You also need to have the power of attorney for your finances.
A reliable person chooses you to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid when you can't do it.
Don't forget the small details: Think that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and go to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about allergies and medications?
Put those details in a written plan for you to be ready.
"It's not just financial thinking, who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to prepare that plan."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home one night.
The victim, aged about 40, was at Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the raid, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as "short action."
The victim didn't see him hurt.
His wounds were not in danger of death, and the police appealed to the witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a severe earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to continue to rise.
As the lines of communication were broken, officials of the aid agencies were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu closer to the epicenter of a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some basic information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrates its 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency with over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The population was estimated at 299,200 in 2017 by the regency, which is an administrative region lower in the province.
Fishing and cultivation is the main economic indicator of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but most of it is in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused the deaths of more than 200 people and the destruction of hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is in the quake section of the Ring of Fire in the Pacific and regularly undergoes an earthquake.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, 226,000 people died on the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Road dead on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude strike in southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coastline, and nearly 700 people died.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake strikes near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, which triggered a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of peaks and resulted in the deaths of about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and fear as people remember the destruction caused by the severe earthquake and the 2004 tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people died, mostly in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings have been destroyed by the earthquake and thousands of tourists have been put in a temporary disaster.
Sarah Palin's Family Arrested on Family Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on allegations of abuse.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for alleged domestic violence, interfering in reporting domestic violence and objecting to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin picked up the phone from her.
Palin was detained at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and was in custody based on <0x24>500 unsecured bonds, KTUU reports.
He met with the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent, certain" when asked about his defense, the network reported.
Palin faced three Class A offenders, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and be fined <0x24>250,000.
He was also kidnapped by Class B offender, with a one-day prison sentence and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal cases have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of hurting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged injury.
The case is currently in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was subjected to family injury, interference in reporting domestic violence, and gun robbery in connection with the incident.
His wife told him that Palin had stabbed him in the face.
Sarah Palin was led by groups of veterans in 2016 after she linked her son's violent act of PTSD originating from her Iraqi service.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead

Federal prosecutors demand the rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in NYC
New York federal prosecutors have imposed the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare penalty not yet enforced in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a cycling road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, which targeted people walking and cycling on his trail in October.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "didn't" kill the eight victims and "didn't" cause serious bodily harm, according to a warning about the intention of the death penalty, offered in the Southern District of New York.
These two charges are likely to be dismissed by the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury filed against Saipov of 22 totals along with eight counts of homicide in support of prosecution, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and accused of violence and de-motor damage.
According to the prosecutors, the attack required "big preparation and planning," and described Saipov's way of implementing it as "caramul-dumal, cruel and cowardly."
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov has brought suffering, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza intensively, and Alejandro Damian at the end of the day."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade since the Southern District of New York was investigated for the death penalty.
Accused Khalid Barnes was sentenced to death by two drug suppliers but was later sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in a federal New York case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the couple buried after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years ago.
Rosenberg's wife died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is from Uzbekistan, did not show regret in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was happy with what he did, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the BBC.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He was not guilty of 22 offenses.
David Patto, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting the confession of guilt for life imprisonment with no chance of release will only last for the trauma that these events lead to in all contexts," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations according to Tory MP
Nigel Farage has vowed to "clean the army of the people" today in protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said that the need for politicians would "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics - while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that she should lead the EU negotiations.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said on the Birmingham march that the UK "would have left now" if Mr Farage were the Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May's future challenge to reconcile her hatred group was suspended by the Tory's admission in favour of Staying in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep the course of his Chequers compromise plan in the midst of attacks from Brexit supporters, who want to stay and the US.
The allies are demanding that he continue to try to have a deal in Brussels despite the unpleasant reaction - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to trade between his plan and the 'disturbance'.
Mr Bone said in Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "scratch the Chequers."
He suggested that Mr Farage should be peered and given responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If we had been there, we would have been able to get out," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit but we need to break the Chequers."
Speaking on his opposition to the US, he said: "We are not fighting world wars just to be adherents.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone dismissed proposals that have changed public opinion since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British have changed minds is not entirely true and they want to stay.'
Andrea Jenkyns, the Brexit Pro Tory, was also on the march and told reporters: 'What I'm saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers don't want the public half, the Opposition doesn't want the Chequers, it doesn't want our party and our activists who walk the street and vote for us.
Please, forget the chequers and start listening.'
In a pressing message to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers will remain in office if they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that rally politicians should "feel pressure" if they are willing to back down the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"It's now about trust between us - and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to backfire on Brexit and we're here now to tell them 'we won't let you do 'it'."
In a message to enthusiastic groups of people he added: "I want you to feel the pressure on our politicians, that Brexit is not going to be reversed.
"We are moving the army of the people in this country who have given us victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we are free, governing ourselves, the high-ranking United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who wanted to stay in Birmingham marched before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
There are targets of activists waging Tory Counter-Brexit flags after the group launches this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis blamed the Conservatives for security issues they faced in a party app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can put IT systems and all the technology for Canada and many more, for no border barriers, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's just a laugh.
"There's nothing better than Brexit," he added.
Warren's plan to "consider well" the running of the presidency
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that "think about running the presidency well" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat attacked his future in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, runs to re-elect November against GOP state representative Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
He is in the midst of speculation that he will fight Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke marks his 36th meeting with those involved using the town hall format since Trump sat down.
One of the participants asked him if he wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix our current government, and with it a woman as president."
Somebody's been arrested after the death of Sims LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La. announced on Saturday that a suspect in the murder and murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an 11 a.m. news conference of ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, and asked for help identifying the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got the bullet right in the head that he killed," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defended his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was asked and admitted to being in the crime scene, with a handgun, and admitted to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior growing up in Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after team orders give him the win from Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes" team order would play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton in his defensive position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to join his teammate.
Vettel first stopped at the pit and left Hamilton to go to traffic at the end of the group, something that must have decided on the result.
Mercedes pushed past a lap and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton ahead of the finish line in which Ferrari's driver raced to leave the interior free of danger to continue defending after the double-move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from behind the grid and was seventh in the final lap of the first lap on his 21st day.
He then led much of the race as he continued to run to target the quick finish and ahead of Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth.
He later stopped pitting in the 44th lap but was unable to speed up his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri has been doing great all weekend and has really been welcoming and giving me.
"The team has done something extraordinary to get one-two," Hamilton said.
Really Bad for the Body’s ‘Yon
President Donald Trump beat Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for his rage that he did not disclose the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly accept Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, rather commenting that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "critical and evil and lying."
"A thing that can happen and the good things that have happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry and angry and bad and lying," he said.
"When you see the broadcasts and the announcements after they say 'ah, I'm not the one doing that.
I'm not the one doing that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, is that you?
Remember his answer... did you publish the document - "Ah, ah, what?"
Ah, no.
I'm not the one who's laughing."
Just go.
"No, we didn't," he said, adding: "We're not talking about it.
Feinstein received the letter detailing allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was released in the early part of September - but Feinstein denied that his office had been released.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not disclose his story," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and that's what I did, as he asked."
But the past of his resignation to the president was not good, commenting on the rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, it's a really bad bodywork.
He probably didn't, but 'that's the worst bodywork I've ever seen."
In continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual harassment of three women, the president said Democrats were using the allegations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to regain power in any way.
You see the cruelty, the evil, they don't care who gets hurt, who they're going to suffer to gain power," the president's mediaite report said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars returned to victory over the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by winning the return match 5-3 for Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored just two early goals by strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie crossed the home side before Dwyer returned only the Giants.
Francois Bouchard pitched the game for Dundee before winning two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen.
It was the third in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth appearance of the season on both sides, winning the Giants in the last three games.
Dwyer's opener entered the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, and David Rutherford gave the assist as Beauvillier dined just four minutes later.
During the busy opening period, Sullivan returned home side to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie's face at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead in the first break when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home side reunited and Bouchard again passed them with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen give Dundee only for the first time in the game in the final part of the second period and he ensured the win in his team's fifth half until the final period.
The Giants, who are now three out of four of their last five games, will return and go to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Killed While Surviving Airplane Traffic Traffic Traffic
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been called a hero after he died while making sure that a cargo plane could fly safely with hundreds of people.
More than 800 people were killed and many lost after a severe earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which started the tsunami.
A strong aftershock continued to strike the area and many were forced into the ruined buildings in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the downhill control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu airport.
He left to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could fly safely.
He then jumped into the traffic control tower when he thought it would break.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have killed hundreds of people, Australia's ABC News reported.
We took a helicopter from Balipapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Fortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts are filled with this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, as according to the country's disaster mitigation agency, access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is still believed to be increasing because more bodies are under the demolitions of buildings while others are inaccessible," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters destroyed Palu that would hold a multiple funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are also carrying aid and supplies to the airline.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives with a dead body.
There is a shortage of clean water.
There are small shops all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is trying to help the survivors but we don't know what they will see there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every liberation work.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit in the first half of this year by earthquakes in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: According to Air Niugini a man is missing after plane crashes into lake
The airline operating the plane crashed into the Pacific Lake in Micronesia with a man missing, after first saying that all 47 passengers and personnel were safely checked out of the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that Saturday afternoon, a male passenger could not be found.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and personnel after the plane crashed into the water as they attempted to land at Chuuk island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were staying in the hospital on Saturday, and all were well.
It remains unclear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed on the lake and did not reach the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
"That's a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the other passengers were able to walk in the water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said he was frightened and the flight attendants shouted, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy also said that rescuers who arranged the port nearby by using a submerged boat to take people to the beach before the plane sank at about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in the crashes of airlines registered with the PNG over the past two decades but Air Niugini has not yet been involved.
The timeline of the night that a woman burned alive
The prosecution concluded its argument on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning alive a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Secretary Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cellphone records to match the actions of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones that appeared with Tellis on the night of his death, contrary to what Tellis previously said, Clarion Ledger reports.
When data showed that the man's cell phone had been to Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was in another location that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another disagreement was that Tellis said about two weeks ago that he knew Chambers at the time of his death.
According to the phone records, they only met for a week.
Rowlett said that Chambers' death had passed, Tellis retrieved the texts, calls and contact information of Chambers on his phone.
"She's the girl in her life," Hale said.
Its final arguments are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped to go to the jury on that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The three hip hop want to encourage a negative outlook on the genre by placing positive messages on their music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says that hip hop is far from the sources of its political message and responds to social issues.
They want to go back to their origins and re-examine the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have re-emerged in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
It's black again!?
A young man in New York jailed a couple for removing him from work after "racist" text
A man in New York has sued the couple for discriminatory removal from work after receiving a misrepresentation text from the mother who claims that he is "six again."
The couple denied that they were racist, and compared the lawsuit to the "consequences."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who has two children, expressed disappointment when she learned that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was a black man after her first day at work in 2016.
"HINDIIIIIIIIII. TIME OF NAME," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in his text to his wife.
So, instead of sending it to his wife, he sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After noting her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman's "loving" wife, Maurice, says that the job of their ex-husband, who is an African-American, and what she expects is a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her one day at work and sent home to Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for pay for dismissal, and demands a payout of <0x24>350 per day for six-month, stay-in job he would have, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know this discrimination."
The couple also apologized for the allegations that they were racist, saying the removal of Maurice from work was reasonable, they feared they would not trust him after they hurt his feelings.
"My wife sent me a text that she didn't really want to say.
He is not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Do you trust your children in a person you've spent, even if you don't trust?"
"Your newborn baby?"
It’s not.”
As Plasco condemned the lawsuit, he said it was only two months after his wife was born and was "very difficult in the situation."
"You're going to ask someone like that?
“It’s not a big deal,” added the investment banker.
As the case progressed, the couple quickly contested on social media, prioritizing their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear that readers won't like the talk of bears, blaming a new letter
It says of Bond's letter to Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of a person reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's exciting to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
She still believes even to deny her work, she says of her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before getting inspiration from the little bear toy who wrote the book, and she added that "we're happy and sad" the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book after it was published.
He describes Paddington as "an important member of our family," adding that his father was proud of the victory in the final.
"He's a quiet man, and he can't help it," he said.
"Just because Paddington is true to him, it's like your son has something: you're proud of them even if you don't have it.
I think that's what he thought of Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he then gave Paddington himself the honour."
I'm on the phone when my son dies.
Her son was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried but failed to save his life.
"When Nad called to say that she was really sick, that she had no hope of living," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Afterwards, I received a call from Nad saying that he was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to let him know.
And that’s what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, son.
I'll be there soon.
With us.
Gradually, her body was depleted and she lost the medicines that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping.
He died before it and ‘all was shot down.
I can't help but sit there and wait, as long as I know all this is happening.
I can't cry or cry because there are so many families and people around me.
I had to take everything away."
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already saddened by her son's departure, boarded an airplane with other passengers - who had no home at his disposal.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I was so tired, I didn't stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane I felt too sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know he loves the baby."
Women's clothing stores are designed to keep the cars on the road.
Two women who lost loved ones in suicide are trying to prevent others from committing suicide as well.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place on the Welsh bridge cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm feeling every day," he said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son hopes to be a chef with a pleasant smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They've always said that their smile is fun."
He left his job before he died, because "he was so sad."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother saw his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always worried that this will have an impact."
Ms Davis made the cards, "to tell people that they can go and talk, even if it's a friend.
Don't shut up - you need to talk to someone."
Ms Humphreys, who had been friends with Ms Davies for a few years, was abandoned by Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother left.
"He didn't say he was sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"At the end of the day, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He's sad that he's sad on Christmas Day - when the kids open their gifts he doesn't fight with them."
He told them that his death was a major trauma, but they needed to accept it: "It's really a huge loss to the family.
We're getting confused.
But we have to keep going and fight."

The next day, Brett Kavanaugh was suspended as the FBI began an investigation.
"I thought, if we could do something as he requested - an investigation in a limited time, limited scope - there would be at least a bit of unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be "dismantled" amid protests from the parties.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters ask the FBI to investigate?
It's because of all the time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans fail, they will be too weak in their attempts to elect the person they want to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls the Senators, talking to them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and thereby met his wife Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI's report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to resolve the ballot table and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's defensive leader 'returns' under Kim
North Korea's number of defectors in South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un sat seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
While citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, Park Byeong-seug said that there were 1,127 defecations last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said there was a big deal of stricter border controls between North Korea and China and a higher threshold for human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
Most defectors from North Korea are offered to the successor of South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, with the longest border with North Korea and easier to cross than the tightly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them to be repatriated.
It has had a great deal of controversy over the past months of North-South relations - which in fact are still conflicting.
In the first part of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks aimed at delayed negotiations on denuclearization.
This took place after the historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on the general limits for the deal to the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized U.S. sanctions for lack of deployment since then.
"Without trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation, we will never be able to afford to disarm," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "too funny," not eligible to serve in the Supreme Court
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "too funny" and said because of her behavior she was not eligible to serve the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman is in this position, they'll say 'too loud'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his inaugural speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost screaming on occasions and crying as his family and his high school years were discussed.
He also condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "short and coordinated awards" arranged by liberals in anger over Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve the Supreme Court, because it showed him not in favor of Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he's competing with the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if he would try to verify Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and whether the Democrats would get a majority in the Lower Assembly.
"I'm going to say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, that means he's not just entitled to the Supreme Court, but also the court he's holding now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In hearings for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time for a nice and meaningful person to go to court and hopefully we will say, 'Isn't it nice 'that'," Pelosi said.
And women need to use it.
It's a fair competition, it sparks many months and years of anger, and he can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years ago.
"I think it's just normal, isn't it?"
She continues, "A woman executive in a place has helped me a lot, who says she's also crying when she's angry, but she's done a way that when she's angry and starts crying, she'll tell the person she's talking to, "You think I might be sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And he continued.
I think that’s good.”
Tears are allowed as a way of getting out of anger because first misunderstanding them.
One of my clearest memories from my previous jobs, in an office worn by men, where I cry with inexorable rage, is to stab me in the coffin of an older woman - a blind manager I'm always afraid of - and drive me to a staircase.
"Don't let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy to cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of Congress Democrat from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart in his presidency runs.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in the comfort of his wife in a boat called Monkey Business and crashed into the fight, Ms. Schroeder, who was really disappointed, thought that there was no reason for him to refrain from running for president himself.
"It wasn't really a good idea to make that decision," he told me when he laughed 30 years later.
"There are seven candidates, and they don't need another.
One man called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign began a long time ago, he was left out of fundraising, so he promised he would not join the fight unless he could win <0x24>2 million.
There is no victory in that fight.
He found that some of his supporters who donated <0x24>1,000 to men would only give him <0x24>250.
"Do you think they're talking about me?" he asked.
When he talks and announces he will not launch a formal campaign, he is ending with emotion - grateful to the people who support him, disappointment in the system where it is very difficult to get money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger at gender discrimination - so he cries out.
"You think I've had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
"You think Kleenex is sponsoring me.
I remember thinking, what would they put on my rock?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war can improve in Beijing
The beginnings of the trade war between the U.S. and China are confusing, and although the fight is still far from over, Beijing's long-term trade gap could be better, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued the first warning in the first part of this year by taxing China's major exports including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
Entering this week is the largest reduction in new tariffs affecting the <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) value of goods, which in fact is taxing half of all U.S. imports from China.
Beijing is rewarding each time, the last one being the rollout of five to ten percent of <0x24>60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged that the US will be loyal to each of its actions, and that the world's second-largest economy will probably not be compromised in the near future.
In order for Washington to resign, it would have to give up on the demands, but an open resignation in the US would be a shame for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing works well, China's support for U.S. trade pressures in the long-term trade war would be positive by lowering the level of ties between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would start economic cohesion in either of the two countries, is more dangerous than what observers accepted at the time," said Abigail Grace, an Asian-oriented research associate at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'prepared' for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in the country's re-establishment that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking in front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country had improved.
"The situation is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to work on rehabilitation in areas that were damaged by terrorists to restore everything to normal.
There are already all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country where they have left because of terrorism and the single-handed economic measures aimed at their daily lives and pursuits.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
And six million people still living in the country need volunteer assistance.
Al-Moualem said the regime in Syria was open to help rebuild the destroyed country.
But he insisted that it would not receive any help with conditional or help from countries that promote poverty.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA in the final score of 16.5 out of 10.5 at Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
Six consecutive U.S. three in Europe and no European Ryder Cup wins since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. tee-shot star Phil Mickelson, who had suffered throughout the tournament, crashed into the water in the par-3 16th hole, and he received the defeat of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, went up in all of his rounds, and became a 1-to-4 player to have a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest-ranked European team player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World top-ranked player Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who may have been in his last Ryder Cup game.
Eight Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most successful in the tournament of all time in his 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but now I can't stop.
This man has become difficult.
So I thanked Thomas and he chose me and he trusted me.
I'm so happy to have the cup again.
It's about the team, and I'm happy to help," said Garcia, who became emotional, following the success in Europe.
He handed over the task to his compatriot John Ram who defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in 2&1 in Sunday's singles game.
"I'm really proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods was defeated in all four of his games in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A unique statistic of one of the best players of all time, winning 14 major titles that only doubled Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled throughout the weekend to find the fairways except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
US Captain Jim Furyk said after a poor performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these people, they fight.
We've had a little bit of trouble with Europe this morning.
We fought.
Greetings to Thomas.
He's a good captain.
The game was very good for all 12 players.
We'll be back together, I'll be working with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll be back.
I love this 12-year-old and I'm usually a captain.
You're really healthy.
They're just better."
