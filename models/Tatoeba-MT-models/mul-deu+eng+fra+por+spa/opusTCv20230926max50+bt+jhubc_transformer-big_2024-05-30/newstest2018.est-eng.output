Four members of the Kemerovo Group were detained in Estonia and Spain
In Spain, police arrested Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo grouping in the Estonian Alliance, known as Slava Kemerovski in the criminal world.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested on court order.
Yesterday, the court also detained three suspects detained in Estonia.
The suspects are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal community aged 27-57, who mainly commit drug crimes.
In the province of Malaga, Spain, an alleged criminal association driver was arrested in Mijas.
In Estonia, three men were detained as suspects, one of whom, according to the data collected, is a leading figure in the criminal community and two are members of the criminal community.
The data collected indicates that the criminal community had clearly allocated tasks and roles.
The aim of the criminal community was to cope with drug offences and thus earn criminal income," said the head of the prosecutor's pre-trial proceedings, Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out an increase in the circle of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have previously been involved in the interests of law enforcement, some of whom have been penalised for drug offences.
Mr Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues was important throughout the investigation.
“International cooperation has become normal for us and this week’s operation shows the success of the cooperation,” said Prosecutor Verte.
The head of the Central Criminal Police Service, Ago Leis, said the detention was preceded by a preliminary investigation that lasted nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work was carried out and we were simultaneously detained in Estonia and Spain for suspected crimes," he said.
In addition, the Central Criminal Police Officers were assisted in detention in Spain.
For years we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and civil card forces.
These detentions are another message to the criminals that we can catch them from the other side of Europe,” said Leis.
The information gathered so far indicates unambiguously that suspected men may continue committing new crimes while in prison, which is why the Prosecutor's Office requested their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting his surrender to Estonia.
In the context of this criminal case, real estate, vehicles and cash are detained for the purpose of ensuring confiscation.
The prosecutor’s pre-trial proceedings are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organised Crimes Bureau and headed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced her to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered to be the second most important man in the world in Estonian crime after former world leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevi<0xC5><0xA1> from Kemerovo emerged in the Estonian Alliance in the early 1990s, when he began dealing with blackmails in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating in various hotels and asked a businessman for a monthly roof tax.
International joint operations, confiscation of criminal proceeds and enforced judicial decisions confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the last sentences, the eight defendants separated from the so-called Dikayev criminal community, from whom the criminal income of 80 000 euros was confiscated, or the sentence against nine persons that Igor Aleynikov was linked to the conspiracy of the criminals in 2006, and the conspiracy of the criminal community, which was targeted by the conspiracy of the Ida-Dikayev criminal community.
The amount of confiscated criminal income is around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>71,500.
The success of these criminal cases has been ensured by the daily exchange of information and evidence between police officers and foreign colleagues and, if necessary, joint action in any EU country.
Civil Rights Watch Warns of Traveling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri against the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group’s statement reads: “The NAACP travel note on the state of Missouri, valid until August 28, 2017, invites all hard-line passengers, visitors and Missourians from African Americans to be on their way around the entire state, which is especially alert, attentive, and very forward-looking.
According to NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue travel warnings, both by the recent Missouri law, which makes it difficult to overcome cases of discrimination, and by the fact that the targets of the state’s prosecutors are, in a disproportionately large part, precisely minorities.
“People’s civil rights are being violated.
They are drawn to the teapot because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," NaaCP Missouri branch president Rod Chapel told The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had such a strong complaint before."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization about the U.S. state.
The group referred to events such as racist abuse of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he was taken out of the state by gasoline and was arrested by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
A recent report by the Missouri Attorney General indicates that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped in the state than white drivers.
"The remark is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
“People need to be ready, that means taking cash or informing relatives that they are going through the state.”
Based on the latest data from the FBI hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, ranking 16th in the state in terms of the number of similar violations.
Travel warnings are also a response to Missouri’s new law, which makes it harder for a company to appeal to a court when seeking a home or job for discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes about Texas and Arizona after these states passed immigration laws that obliged local people to be able to arrest for immigration violations because of its high profile of ACLU.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about other countries, but interest groups have recently begun to use this measure in response to certain domestic laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis or hepatitis can be caused by five different hepatitis viruses - A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C, which can develop further into liver cirrhosis, or liver failure and liver cancer, is at a disadvantage.
The health agency’s epidemiologist adviser, Kulu Kutsar, says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grey rashes, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and joint pain.
The last symptom of the disease also derives from the popular name of hepatitis.
In children, hepatitis can progress without signs of disease.
Various types of hepatic inflammation can only be determined on the basis of laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can turn into chronic hepatitis and go on for decades without symptoms of the disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his dangerous liver disease.
Listen Kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread to sick people and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, during sex, from the infected person’s rashes to food, surfaces, objects, ingestion of the mouth, and drug use.
The risk-or-risk group of hepatitis A includes family members and caregivers of the disease, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with the infection, men having sex with men, drug users, travelers visiting countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, especially vaccination is recommended for many travelers and people at risk for hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands, before eating, wash all fruits and vegetables.
Hepatitis B viruses spread when a person is exposed to human blood, when hepatitis is injected with drugs, when tattooed, swallowed, when using blood-contaminated human objects (shaving brushes, shaving agents), when donating blood, having sex with a suspected person of hepatitis, and when hepatitis is injected into the mother/fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis B includes injectable drug users, infected human sex partners, men having sex with men, infected mothers newborns, sick family members and caregivers, contact with blood and other body fluids.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, as well as people with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventative measures for hepatitis B include: abstaining from the use of foreign hygiene and manicure, other sharps and needle needles, tattooing and aging, and the use of condoms in case of contagious sex or preventing sexual risk.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the Estonian national immunization plan and is free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses spread when a person is exposed to human blood, when a person is injected with drugs, when tattooed, swallowed, when using blood-contaminated human objects, when a donor has blood, when having sex with a suspected person of hepatitis, and when hepatitis is transmitted from the mother to the fetus/newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis C includes injectable drug addicts, infected human sex partners, men having sex with men, infected mothers newborns, sick family members and caregivers, contact with blood and other body fluids.
Prevention measures for hepatitis C are: abstaining from the use of foreign hygiene and manicure, other sharpeners and needles, tattooing and constipation, and the use of condoms in case of constipation.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which multiplies in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses spread through contact with blood and other body fluids, infected syringes, genital routes, and rarely from infected mothers to fetuses.
The group at risk for hepatitis D includes chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who are not immune to hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses spread fecal-orally with drinking water and food, including low heat-treated animal meat, fish and nuts, donor blood, shared syringes and infected mother foetus.
Passengers may be infected with hepatitis E in countries with high prevalence of hepatitis E.
The prevention measures for hepatitis E are to meet the hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after sick care.
Fruits and vegetables should be washed before consumption, avoid eating low heat-treated animal meat, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water, and avoid drug use.
While in the final round, competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic winner off the track, 34-year-old Farah found strength and won with time 26.49.51.
Farah did not think for long, dragging his wife Tania and children to the track after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I love my family very much.
It was wonderful to be on the road with them,” Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for the fifth consecutive 5,000- and 10,000-meter-long gold duel in London.
Anything is possible if you believe it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Lady in the Gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer" plunges into the Vienna culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
But even more in-depth history.
The high volume of information to be recovered would be spent on a harder, narrower theme, with the exception of the portrait allowed in the title to have a much greater impact.
There would now be two books between them: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, depicted by Gustav Klimt and his painting "The Lady of Gold", and a much larger and broader history book of respected Jewish families and the German occupation of Austria with its implications.
The first third of the book carries the pulpit of Vienna’s cultural life, and who himself landed in the Austrian capital, can hardly imagine how more than a hundred years ago life went around Ringstrasse or how all the heads of the Central cafe turned when Klimt entered.
The concentration of cultural spectators was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and in the book, seeing the name familiar, you felt yourself as if you were a grammatical culture.
However, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a town where he was sick with untreated syphilis and had the highest level of suicide in Europe, history does not seem to add anything to the development.
Or maybe even - every pair of pink bricks add color to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
The dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
By the turn of the century, nearly every ten inhabitants of Vienna had a Jewish population.
Adele’s parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married Ferdinand Bloch and Klimt for her famous paintings, she was the seventh largest bank of the Habsburg empire.
But Adelet did not draw all that glamorous life where she was famous for.
When looking at the "Lady in Gold", it is hard to believe that the end of life this great lady infected with socialism and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband’s portrait from Klimt, the last minute was the hottest painter in Vienna.
At the time, the climbing order cost 4,000 kroner, a quarter of the price of a good-located house.
The fact that, in some portraits, the master's love story with the model was suspected, did not cast the sugar magnet.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only certain fact is that the relationship between the model and the artist that emerged during the work continued for the rest of her life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Ladies cheers.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, The Extraordinary Story of the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before the work began, Klimt had visited the basilica in Ravenna in San Vitale, and researchers believe that the magnificent mosaics of Empress Theodore’s appearance there gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adel as a mosaic painted by him.
Klimt presented his "Lady's Gold" in Vienna in 1908 and about the same time (in the years 1907-1908) was born in the second golden country "Kusudlus".
Art historians did not notice the similarity of the two women.
What does Hitler have to do with the story?
"I think in memory of my friend Klimt, I owe it to him to make his handiwork available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wished that their family would come to Klimt.
Six years before his death, Klimt had prepared another portrait of Adel.
Also in her testament (Adele left in February 1925) she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four of Gustav Klimt's landscape to the Austrian Gallery.
He inherited his jewelry from his sister-in-law, Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had graduated from the Austrian Mona Lisa, he had tried to get to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts at age 17 Adolf Hitler, but fell through the drawing process.
Although Hitler’s later anti-Semitism is sometimes considered to be the reason why Jewish professors did not accept him into the academy, none of his exams were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in the will of Maria, had changed significantly by 1939 - it had become important to find pleasing works from the rich Jewish art churches in Vienna to the Nazi Party.
Some of Adele’s work at home was also suitable for Hitler’s personal arts, but not Klimt’s.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a decade-long litigation between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauers began.
It should be noted here that if you see "The Kiss" at the Belvedere Castle in Vienna, then you should see the "Golden Lady" depicting Adele Bloch-Bauer in New York City's New Gallery.
And before the trip to Vienna, read the aforementioned book.
Even if you don't plan to go to see Klimt's works, because at least my emotions have shifted after the book's closure over the Nazi and Jewish themes sold for <0x24>135 million by the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much a portrait, rather a story of the fate of the family - and a very moving story.
Significantly, the Baume family tree at the beginning of the book made it easier to focus on events.
The 17-year-old swimmer in Canada was close to the Estonian record.
In the lead, Gold was very close to the personal record of his 200 m backsliding while swimming at 2.16.62.
Topmark dates back to the 17-year-old’s 10-week rear when the Canadian Junior Championships reached 2.16.58, according to the Priit Desert Swimming Blog.
Gold reached the final, or 10th A-finals.
In the final, he scored a distance time of 2.15.76 and reached a good seventh place with a new strong peak margin.
Alina Kendzior's Estonian record (2.15.13) was broken by Gold for just over half a second.
Gold rose third in Estonia’s all-time rankings, and its fresh personal peak market is Estonia’s fifth result of all-time.
The young future is still in the Canadian adult championships in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestyle and in the 200 m and 400 m complex.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships took place in Toronto, and Gold made successful starts there as well.
He won the 200m freestyle with a silver medal time of 2.03.22.
So quickly, this distance was last floated by Estonia in 2008.
In Estonia, only Estonian recordist Elina Partõka has lost this distance faster than Gold.
The Estonian living in Canada won the bronze medal in the 100m freestyle with an excellent personal record and with the new Estonian season’s top margin of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, who is one year older than him, is only one century faster than this distance.
He reached his personal peak when he received the notification in the opening exchange letter time of 1.03.69.
In the half-longest distance, he only reached seventh place when swimming in the final 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season table at four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics tear their teeth
The time for the holidays is at hand - it also means relaxation for US President Donald Trump.
However, as Trump has been one of the president’s most popular holidays so far, critics are already grinding their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president plans to spend a 17-day vacation at his own golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
While the president’s holiday began yesterday, Trump’s opponents have been speaking about the holiday for a week.
They're giving Trump too much rest.
In fact, the president usually spends a weekend in his own Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villas.
Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days.
George W. Bush, for example, had 67 days on vacation at that time, while Barack Obama was half less than Trump, only 21 days.
However, Trump is quick to forget things.
A few days after becoming president, Trump said, sending "60 minutes" for a long break, that there is no time left for his office, because there is a lot to be done.
He also expressed anger about Barack Obama’s vacation three years ago.
The current president tweeted: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, the head of ISIS journalists is shaking."
According to White House officials, a 17-day visit to the golf club does not really have any relaxation.
It’s officially called a work holiday, during which Trump doesn’t have time for reading or other intriguing activities.
There was also another reason for the holiday.
In other words, the air conditioning system is replaced in the western part of the White House and therefore all staff had to leave.
The Oval Cabinet and other offices of the President are also located in West Virginia.
“I don’t think anyone else would want to be in the West in August if there are 38 degrees and there is no air conditioner,” White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said, stressing that the president will continue to work during the holidays.
When President Trump spends the next 17 days, you get an idea of the video.
Blocking Critics from Facebook Don’t Apply to State if You Don’t tolerate Voter Criticism
Our country's father knew so much about the unfavorable media age.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to start stifling him for anything from domestic politics to political principles.
Criticism, of course, annoyed him.
But he didn’t silence his critics.
In 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away from us and, in the dark and in the silence, we can be led to the rightful slaughterers of sheep.”
This brings me to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who has to work harder to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates have blocked and deleted at least 450 posts of people who posted their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And at the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued him.
The governor's official dismissed the lawsuit and web comments were cunning against the counter-reactions in the style of "Who cares?".
“It’s just Facebook,” many said.
But it counts.
And that counts a lot when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
This is an astonishingly popular Republican governor in an overly democratic state.
His approval percentage is in second place among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not an unreasonable reactionary buzzhead.
He has ruled the state firmly and has remained strictly committed to his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool for communicating with his voters quite frightenedly, for example, introducing you to your shiny head after chemotherapy for the first time.
Thus, the governor’s page, which is an official-labeled public forum, managed by taxpayers’ salaries in dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people visiting staff.
Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's conduct in an interview with The Washington Post, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it’s too easy to paint a picture of online rogue internet trolls, spammers, or a crowd full of anger.
The Post talked to a lot of real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that's exactly what they're really people who communicate with their chosen leaders. A teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not an internet troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and in no way ugly.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, stressing Hogan’s Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Raman, a lawyer from Maryland Bowie, did not stir up anger, but rather about hate crimes.
“I was wisely commenting that I was disappointed because he hasn’t responded to hate crimes or other recent news,” he wrote in a comment section of The Post.
“However, I don’t like the idea that as many people comment on the same topic, someone immediately calls it an indifferent collective effort, instead of admitting that it’s a matter of great concern to a large number of citizens.”
What the governor’s official called a “directed spam attack,” others would probably call “public support.”
The age of Facebook makes it easy to customize messages by simply blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much cleaner than in the past when workers had to be sent out to do the same, to collect newspapers with critical headlines, to burn them, or to arrest protesters, and to silence them.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official to be criticized for hacking Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first notable judgments on this subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that Loudoun County Supervisory Board spokeswoman violated the first amendment of the Constitution when she blocked voters from her Facebook page.
Kentucky also visited ACLU after using Facebook and Twitter, Governor Matt Bevinit (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington’s time, affordable postal costs had a similar effect as on the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800 the quadruple number of newspapers and anonymous writers obscured his management.
And even then Washington had to face the anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under such pseudonyms as Juricola, Valerio, Belisarius, and Portius, making Washington’s decisions at the ground level.
According to the historical documents compiled by the George Washington Online Letter Collection Project, he summed up the cabinet in petitions that criticized his views on the friendship, trade and shipping agreements concluded with the United Kingdom.
But he didn't make them shut up.
Freedom of speech, disagreements and debates are the prerequisites for our country.
And right management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for comfort of home territory at the Renaissance Club
Former European predecessor Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of home territory over the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open will take place on the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf courses.
The North Irishman, who had led the last round on the nearby Archerfield Links last year before Paul Eales was down, is keen on a new venue and will serve as the tournament's messenger instead of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we’re seeing the club sparkle in full glory with this event,” Rafferty said.
"Players see the track in their best form, it's in a magnificent state.
Jerry has done a great job building this place.
He is a passionate supporter of the golf game and feels proud of what has been achieved here.
This allows for a great presentation of the track.”
England Eales is looking forward to defending the championship for the first time, although the man has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"It sends a very special feeling," said the player who was in Southport.
“I couldn’t defend my title in the Extremadura Open because it was removed from my race calendar a year after my victory.
It's magical to come back to this place.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, the victory of last year was special.
It was a very special time that we will carry in our hearts forever.”
Gary Orr, who joined the Senators' European Tour at the start of the year when he was 50.
This is his first event in Scotland after taking part in the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing at home is always a little more meaningful," said Orr, a man from Helensburg.
"You want to perform well, but at the same time you feel extra stress.
I have enjoyed the game a lot again and have shown a fairly decent golf game.
I’m happy with the way things are going.”
The trio is joined by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Ark Captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scottish competitors, the rest of them are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Poverty and death in Indonesian gold
When Bardina Dege prepares dinner, she doesn't use pencil.
He rarely even uses a pot.
In a wooden mansion in Enarotal, the capital of the Pania regency of Papua Province, Indonesia, a housewife puts a batata in the local language called nota's at a fire station.
After half an hour, take the soaked form from the fire and squeeze the skin innately with your hands without washing.
Degei sits on a muddy floor with no furniture and there she also does her daily household chores, for example, washing with fog from the nearby sex.
The role of walking is filled by amber without a roof in the room.
Since she is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she is not assigned to take care of any of the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Late work, however, can be dangerous for most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink hard, plus there are still soldiers here.
“No one dares to walk around the village after five o’clock in the evening,” he says.
This is a rare sight to live in the hills of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was joined by Indonesia in 1969 after a polemic led to a referendum, during which only 1026-year-old occupying forces were forced to cast their votes.
The movement prompted the liberation of the Dutch from power quickly directed its anger against the Jakarta government, which still keeps the region under its strong control, keeping away from foreign journalists and human rights observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, so that the island of Papua New Guinea remained independent.
Enarotal is a remote and abandoned place. To get there, you need to fly 90 minutes from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabires and then take a five-hour trip by renting a car.
There is no public transport.
With a population of about 19,000, the city is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo barrels and covered by slippery iron roofs, the rusts of which have turned into a variety of tones of coal.
Very few Indonesians have embarked on a journey here, not to mention journalists, nor have they visited here almost at all.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the prayers of Mee Pago worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing such clothes,” says Degei, referring to his colourful hand-knitted turban, dark blush, and erect silk.
"Before that, we only wore vegetables on the body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of people living below the poverty line, and statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are among the worst in Asia.
But it is also the golden country of Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Pania, a New Jersey-sized mountainous province of about 153,000 inhabitants, lies the world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, which belongs to the Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran company.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about <0x24>3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be proud of consumptive forest reserves worth an estimated <0x24>78 billion.
But these treasures are the source of the suffering of the papacy, as they are the result of the powerful presence of the Indonesian military.
A 2005 study by The New York Times found that Freeport paid local military and military units about <0x24>20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to <0x24>150,000 per officer.
The efforts of the papacy to ensure greater autonomy threaten it with gold and will be relentlessly circumvented.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 priests have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the mountainous regions of Papua in the 1970s were of genocide.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested by Indonesian police.
The 2016 report of the Bishopric of Birsbane "We Lose Everything" contains testimony to the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial convictions, torture (according to each other's reports, rape and electrocution are particularly prevalent) and the decommissioning of pre-peaceful genocide.
“The number of casualties is difficult to calculate because such incidents occur every week,” said Andreas Harsono, a Indonesian human rights investigator at Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been tightened even more, as the natural resources of Papua have caused new arrivals from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the province’s 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but the demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants from the islands of Jaava, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi come from Indonesia.
Jaawala family snacks sell gado-gado with cybecana and mixed vegetables, served with peanuts.
The locals can’t compete with them.
“Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables cheaper than local papayas on the traditional market,” explains 24-year-old Paniai-born Abeth You, who moved to Jayapur, the province’s capital, for work.
"The pope's mama-mama's [women] are therefore losing their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known among the people as Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
On his way to the presidential palace of Jakarta, the former woodpecker won 29 of the 27 constituencies in Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014, we voted for Jokowi in hopes that he would fulfill our hopes of restoring justice,” You said.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai suffered from low self-esteem.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang a Christmas song near a cave in Enarotal when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle from the darkness.
The children who met told them to turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Yaved Teba, one of the soldiers insulted their ballot box and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers were drunk after the children and washed them with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers fired at the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulian Yeimot, was hit so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, a nearby election commission building was set on fire and the next day things escalated even more.
Approximately 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at the football field in front of the local police department and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting buses and performed a waita-tans of the Papua mee Pago tribe, during which they ran around and toured the bird song.
Some of the protesters began to stone the police and the military.
"If the masses are resisting more than three times, shoot them down," the official document said, which TIME magazine saw, but which has not been issued to local media outlets.
Jeremiah Kayam, 56, the elder of the town of Kego Koto in Enarotal, felt the threat and called for peace, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he told TIME magazine in his bright colours on the porch of the wooden room.
Kayama still doesn't know who was the shooter, but he says the moon came from the ranks of assembled soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, a lot of revenge," he added.
A local man, Alfius Youw, was shot three times, according to his cousin.
"I ran to him and looked through his body to make sure it was him," said the skeptic John, who uses only one name for many Indonesians.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua police chief inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only ensured the safety of their department as it was attacked.
“We need to protect ourselves when we are threatened with death,” said Pudjo Sultisio, a Papuan police spokesman in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and were seriously injured.
News of the killings arrived in Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy to the families of the victims and promising to deal with the abuses in Papua.
“I want to resolve this case right away so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve human rights offences.
Almost immediately there were apologies.
“Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
"The thing is, we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes," he said.
Speaking to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June, Wiranto said that he had no intention of establishing a mechanism for dealing with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything is settled by law.”
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of human rights abuses in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the 1999 East Timor Independence Referendum, said 11 human rights abuses have already been resolved in Papua, including Paniai.
The families of the victims at the time accepted such allegations with a ghastly mischief.
"I've been overheard four times over the last three years, but no progress has been made," John said.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view that the people of the Lord are afraid of this incident.
He said he was kicked out of the military after helping to bury four victims.
“After the burial of the dead, the military came to look for me,” he says.
The shootings didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in the neighbouring region of Paniai in Deiya.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, as a conversation took place between the villagers and the construction company manager, who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
The 24-year-old Ravian Douw, who drowned fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry visitors protested at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to police, the villagers stoned the policemen, after which the latter responded with warning bills.
But according to local claims, a mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in great panic, we are afraid of revenge," Domunggu Badi, 29, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured incarcerated.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the responsibility of the relevant police officers and the withdrawal of the police mobile brigade from the area.
It has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the meek, many, Danish and then-tribals living in the decisive central mountainous region of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL), an army of rebels who, according to themselves, defend the rights of the papacy, organising casual attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, the military's pretense of "defending the sovereignty of the state" has detained thousands of people in Paniai in recent years.
Some of them will never come out again.
Among the Papuan people, Paniad is known as the “tragic forgotten place.”
Poverty nourishes dissatisfaction.
A small amount of rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as unprecedented.
People grow all their foods themselves mainly batata, in addition to a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four or five batata vines.
They usually keep most of the harvest to the family, the rest they sell on the local market.
Ten batatas cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have deepened between indigenous papals and new migrants, who have been in large numbers since the opening of new airlines at Napier Airport.
These few jobs that exist will go to better-educated and wealthier migrants.
The papacy itself often lacks the capital or skills necessary to run a competitive business.
“Young people are not interested in staying because there are no jobs or money here,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the world’s eyes away from Pope Francis.
In addition, there are strict restrictions on external media.
By the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, for "they did not follow the appropriate practices", although they were granted a rare filming permit.
According to the deputy head of the Human Rights Watch Asia department, Phelim Kine, Jokowi’s election permissions have not been implemented to lose transparency and development restrictions imposed on reporters.
“In Indonesia, new threats from the most eastern unruly provinces of Papua and reportages from Western Papua are threatening journalists who are trying to make them, including visa refusal and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of insight into journalism means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the closest to Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries in Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "a variety of widespread crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Pania.
These countries have also historically supported the VPL.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the grouping charges, saying journalists in Jakarta: "There is still a democratic regime and freedom of the press in Indonesia, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of human rights cases."
The local people want more foreign governments to pay attention.
When a Dutch official delegation visited Jayapura on May 4 with Kees Van Bara, the state’s human rights envoy, the locals interrupted the meeting, but a source who wanted to remain anonymous said it was quiet, calling for “we want freedom.”
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the pilgrims do not believe they will vote for Jokow again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of Pania," Hobai, the chairman of the Tribal Council, said.
He wants to make it clear to Jokow that, in addition to the fact that the people of Pania are constantly living under the threat of a ruthless military, they are struggling in poverty because of the education and health services of nigerians.
According to Gobai, the people of Pania, as well as the other prayers, owe their voice to Jokow what he has to pay.
“They don’t need money, they want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims were able to deal with the last symbolic retaliation, they buried one of the victims' bodies in a country facing the police department and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be put on the line, they will at least not let the responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus, with his head down.
"What else could we do?"
Dubai Torch’s cloud-fighting fire hit its ground for the second time.
A fire broke through one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high and 79-story building.
This is the second fire that has devastated a high-rise building in just two years, called the Torch, or Tower of Lakes.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and no direct cause of fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up with a fire alarm and people screaming.
We would run down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to subdue the 50th floor," a resident who called himself George told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Protection officials said firefighters had cleared the building at around 4 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they are working to provide security for the victims.
This incident could once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surface of high-rise buildings around the world.
The investigation carried out by the Torch Board after the 2015 fire found that the most damage was caused by the facades - decorative panels and insulation of the exterior surface.
Britain's police have said they believe the isolation and facade panels of London's Grenfell Tower could have contributed to a rapid fire in June that killed some 80 people.
Look: These phones are likely to become sales hits in the fall
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because then phone manufacturers will reveal their new top models.
In the spring came on sale Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium, and in the fall a new hit phone is expected for the polls.
According to Tele2 Marketing and Sales Director Kristjan Sema, this year’s flagship is characterized by innovative design, eye-catching scanner, 4K-resolution edge-server display and high-speed processor.
In the world of technology, the Samsung Galaxy S8 has also reached the forefront of the Estonian smartphone sales table.
In the fall, it allows smart people to charge faster, more durable batteries, better quality cameras and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that on the basis of rumors, it is already possible to make assumptions and predict four top models that are likely to conquer sales tables this year.
These four top smartphone models will reach the stores in the fall of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to reach stores in mid-September.
The rumors about what the new Apple model looks like, and what can be done with it, are spreading a lot.
If the iPhone 7 didn’t make a significant difference in comparison to the iPhone 6s, Apple’s 10th birthday is expected to be completely different from the previous one.
There are four colors: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is lost, and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple’s designer JonyIve demands that the new iPhone model look like a smooth glass.
There has also been talk of the ceramic version of the iPhone.
A faster A11 processor can be expected in addition to eye-to-eye scanners, wireless charging and even more high-quality cameras.
This is one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
The pre-order of the new Galaxy Note 8 will begin on August 23.
There are a lot of rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
Hearingly, even more business users are targeted, and the S Pen enables even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which is an elbow and the other a telephoto lens with a narrower field of view.
Currently, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung’s first test, which is definitely comparable in quality to the iPhone 8.
We look forward to August 23.
Although Nokia has released three smartphones in the front of the Nokia 6 this year, there is still a lack of their flagship - the Nokia 8, which will be launched on August 16.
We expect from Nokia a 5.3-inch peripheral display and high-speed Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and more durable battery.
Nokia also talks about the aluminum case and the significant IP68 water and dust resistance.
Similar to Samsung, the new model has two rear cameras produced by Zeiss.
While Sony’s flagship has been the XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We’re waiting for a smartphone that’s a bit more delicate than the XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
Sony has speculated that the new model is at least six-inch.
What reality brings, we can already see right in the head, because traditionally, Sony has unveiled its fall flagship at the International Technology Fair IFA, which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for border wall
The Washington Post published transcripts of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump telephoned Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to end the public announcement that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States broke the wall with him for publicly condemning him, saying, "You must not tell the press this."
Trump has pledged his presidential campaign to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for this project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, revealing tensions.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that the United States is taking on refugees heading to Australia is "rare", "sluggish" and "rule". He claimed that the deal that was made during the Obama administration would leave him with the "shepherd of the skull" of the skull of the skull as the impression of the skull of the skull.
Trump told Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant speech of the day.”
The Riigikogu did not consider O<0xC3><0x9C> MRP Linid in the case where Tartu City rejected their offer for bus transport from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a handwriting that rejected the offer of O<0xC3><0x9C> MRP Linids Linna in the Tartu bus project because the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, Head of the Tartu Municipal Law Service.
This is a public bus transport project within Tartu city for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP City Lines appealed the decision of the Tartu District Court to the Riigikogu Court.
The Supreme Court did not take this action.
While many people complain on social media that the noise from the Weekend festival disturbs their night and the whole city is full of drunken partyers, there are many who have no bad words to say about the festival that lasts on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the parties in the store were so smart!
I didn't see any bliss or blindness.
“I even saw it,” said Lane.
"It's nice to come, to be and to be known for the joy of Pärnu, which has been left as a winter coat in winter," he adds cheerfully.
It's a hollow wave that hits the beach and doesn't bother.
While living in downtown, she heard music playing on the beach, but now the music hasn’t reached her home stage.
"But I hope I hear," he said happily.
Agnes, who also spoke with the evening, says that the big festival is better for Pärnu - it will contribute well to the turnover of local merchants.
He is also pleased that there are so many foreign tourists in the summer.
A woman's fearful noise doesn't mix.
Although I don't sunbathe on the beach anymore, but it's good that the beach is refreshed.
And it’s good that the people are moving and it’s been like that three times already,” she said.
For the first time, it was a bit worse.
“Maybe there were complaints,” he said.
But the noise on the beach, he said, is common for summer guests.
“This weekend is a very good promotion for our small town,” says Harri, who lives in the park.
Noisy and muzzle didn't even hit the rhythm of his life.
What about what?!
We should keep it all together.
Think about how this inter-ethnic communication would be better.
Choosing music doesn't have to be a man.
It's not confusing, even though I live nearby.
“Good people can keep together and there’s no problem,” he says.
Visitors who have come to Pärnu are wise, he said.
"Of course, they're a little over-exaggerated with the puddles, but the young are young and God bless you - let's go, but be human and we can do it!" he says.
The coastal residents have traveled somewhere far away for this time, whether with relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this kind of noise," says Tiina, who walked with children in Pärnus.
Even his family and festival music are not disturbed, although last year it was even more awkward than the street.
Last summer the stage was different, so we heard more.
We live outside the city ourselves, which in fact smells quite well along the banks of the Pärnu River,” he says.
Pearson to cut another 3,000 jobs and cut dividends to revive business
British education firm Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividends by 72 percent, launching another restructuring program to address business-threatening harassment.
Lost jobs, which are likely to be consolidated by CEO John Fallon at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will be added to the 4,000 jobs lost during the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced plans to cut costs by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million (US<0x24>394 million) as part of a third cost reduction program to try to revive the business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that their expectations for the year had not changed after a 1-percent increase in sales was reported to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
The suicide bomber said officials attacked military convoys in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed one NATO soldier and wounded several others.
In a statement, NATO said five soldiers and translators were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were killed in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest of the violence that has hit Afghanistan this month, killing more than 30 people in the Herat mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
The NATO statement said Thursday evening's explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked "with a man-made explosive body".
According to the statement, everyone has been injured in stable condition and is being treated at the U.S. military giant Bagram airport.
According to the correspondents, the Taliban and a group known as Islamic State (ISIS), an ever-increasing force for the forces in Bagram is a serious concern.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people in the Shia area.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
A major bombing killed more than 150 people in downtown on May 31, the deadliest military attack in the country since U.S.-led forces deterred the Taliban in power in 2001.
This violence highlights the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops assisting the country's military and police.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA cancels after requesting a decision to postpone the imposition of the imposition of the imposition of the imposition of the imposition of the imposition of the imposition of the imposition of the imposition of the imposition of the imposition of the imposition of the imposition of the imposition of the imposition of the imposition of
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has cancelled its decision to delay the adoption of the Obama-era regulation, which obliges states to limit prison-causing emissions, one day after 15 states appealed to the agency due to the delay.
The EPA announced its decision to continue its "2015 Ozone Determination Actions" late Wednesday, saying it shows the Agency's commitment to cooperation with states.
“We believe that we need to have a dialogue with our partners from our countries and listen to them,” EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruit had announced the intention of the EPA to postpone the determination of ozone levels in various parts of the country, in order to determine where that level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to meet the stricter air quality standards.
Fifteen mostly Democratic states filed a lawsuit with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, saying that the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has tried to withdraw several of the environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, according to Trump, which is part of a broader plan to promote economic growth.
But these efforts have led to counter-reactions among Democrats and nature conservation groups, who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website says that inhalation of ozone-containing air "may reduce the working capacity of the lungs and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases", for example asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
German pigs and cattle may have a party because heavy rains threaten the harvest of the second-largest producer of wheat in the European Union, Bloomberg writes.
This year may be that the seasons that lasted weeks before harvesting may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry is only suitable for animal feed.
“The quality of the soil is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015,” said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat could be used for animal feed, which is twice as much as conventional, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, as well as their European colleagues, have faced any weather this year.
First, winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June replaced the hot spring.
In July, the Germans hit the savages, which continued in August.
Many eyes have been directed to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only 5% of wheat has been harvested.
Most harvests have not yet begun in the region, local harvest buyer Ceravis said.
"This is a very difficult day," said Frank Deckert of Ceravis's parent store.
Consistency in all, perhaps, Finnish interior design sparkles
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of masonry houses, because through large windows, the sloping views of the hills of Saimaa reach many (life) rooms.
Every step of the way, our core manufacturers’ efforts to create both sturdy and perfect (energy-saving) homes will begin to be seen.
The Finns’ wood use skills as building and finishing materials, furniture and beauty products are worthy of admiration and adherence.
In fairs, both the builder and the (home) designer will find flowing approaches and smart solutions.
It is evident that the compositions of black, white and gray shades, when supplemented by wood tones and tones, can be very delightful.
Good ideas can go on for another week, because the fair lasts until August 13.
Accessories and herbal potatoes suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
This evening, the Weekend Festival was drawn to Baltic, and Martin Garrix gave everything he could to remember as the last performer.
The people were really turning during the Garrix's performance - singing, hulating, dancing self-consciously.
When Garrix finished, the common mass was spread from the beach of Pärnu to the city.
We bring to your gallery with all the pictures that our photographer tried in three days at the Weekend.
You’re probably one of them, look for yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible opposition
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are expected to be on the collision course to go to the most stringent boxing matches of the near future up to 66.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN's office in Los Angeles, until Garcia, an invincible World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked the other end of the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's closingweight champion.
After Garcia’s unanimous decision to win over former four-time World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday, both fighters are in the front line of the weight table.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. in ESPN.
When posing for a couple of photos, Lomachenko Menedzher Egis Klimas noted that the possible opposition between the fighters would be "perfect measurement".
"I'm a former lockweight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up for the Booker [to 63.5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm 63.5 pounds tall.
I want to move down the light weight.
And he has to move up a light weight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
This is what the fans wanted.
Let’s offer it to them.”
Lomachenko agreed.
"The Pox world needs this fight."
The climate raised the question of whether viewing it should be rewarding. This is part of his strategy, according to which he wants to let Lomachenkol debut in the 61.2 kg class by the end of this year, to make a possible meeting with Garcia in the spring of next summer (37-0, 30 nocautes).
"Looking at this fight could be rewarding, as fans have wanted this opposition," Garcia said, saying later that she is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
“We are the main actors.
No other name can draw so much attention.
Whenever they are ready . . .
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a "strong fighter" and may go to see his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was cautious in praising Garcia, saying that he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted to kill it."
Garcia said the goal was to show the impact strength and then to kick.
The two confirmed that they felt the tensions rising to try to get rich between them.
“It’s a struggle that awaits realization.
No other opponents are attracting so much attention and summation.
I’m more than willing to work for it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It’s going to be a good fight.”
What kind of worlds are you moving to?
The Police and Border Guard Authority (PPA) has extended and issued a record over 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have traveled predominantly to Estonia for work, study or family.
If, for example, a temporary residence permit was issued to 6702 foreigners, the number was 4928.
Officials are unable to say how many immigrants will eventually remain permanent in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ten years ago, in recent years this number has started to grow to close to 2000.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased dramatically during the crisis in Ukraine - in 2014, 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, a year earlier 675.
According to the Statistical Office, the number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia is growing the most, with more than 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia than leaving.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and due to the complex conditions in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many of the families are already in front of it," said Kristin Rammus, spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior.
The number of Ukrainians who received temporary residence permits in Mullu and Tunamulu was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in a total of ten years the most temporary residence permits have been issued to the latter.
If the Ukrainians come here to work mostly, then the Russian citizens are due to family raids.
“Given the historical Russian community here, they are most likely to have the greatest family connections with people living in Russia,” said Helina Maasing, a migration scientist at the Academy of Internal Defence.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have received Estonian residence permits have moved to, then Harjumaa will immediately be in East Virumaa," he added, noting that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Mullu was granted a temporary residence permit in 1696 to a Russian citizen, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wished to extend the residence permit decreased.
“The advantage is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for permanent residence in Estonia,” said Rammus, a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior, who said that the interests of Russian citizens have remained rather stable against the Estonian residence permit for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years may apply for a new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia from the previous year.
Its aim is to promote the survival of adapted people.
The long-term residence permit, for example, requires five years.
As a result of the new residence permit, the old residence permit has also been reduced.
For example, a residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians can exchange jobs and the Estonian state will no longer have time to see if the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit became hopefully popular - still gray passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 people were granted a residence permit to reside in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
The total number of such applicants in the first half of this year is already 1269.
Over the past ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are one of the most active Estonian applicants for a residence permit.
When three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, there were 200 in the country.
You will come from Nigeria to study in these universities.
Also, Estonian universities are popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turkish for example.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely thanks to scholarships.
They also have a rule that where a community has emerged, it is easier to go to others,” Rammus added.
In the last ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from, for example, North Korea, as many from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If a residence permit is granted to about 6,000 third-country nationals per year, it is about 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even if you count on the citizens of the European Union, migration remains around a percentage," Maasing commented that the figures are actually small.
According to the Statistics Office, a total of 14,822 people migrated to Estonia and 13,792.
This means that the immigration exceeded the second year of the expulsion.
Most of the expatriates and immigrants are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among those who leave.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was below 2000 people.
Estonians especially travel between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess costume is charming with saddles, stitches and nuts
For Maria Tammeoru, however, there is history in the time of the idea: old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours somewhere in a museum and admire ancient sleeves and scratches.
If you do something passionately, you study and learn about it every day.
It's a pleasure to discover!
The glamourous world of Mama Couture may seem to some outsiders, but the designer doesn’t think so.
You decide how much light you have in your life.
I have a girlfriend who has a whole sauna full of high couture dresses I created.
Because it's not her fault that she doesn't live in Hollywood, and she doesn't wear red carpets every day, she wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and wear them!
You can live your own life specially!
The fashion artist does not recognize the gap between bright events and the gray everyday life.
It was this thought-provoking step that made a more elaborate plan to bring high fashion in Estonia to lands, between forests and fields, to people whose fashion often fails to reach.
Mammu’s collection was presented, for example, at Võrus, Jõhvis and Pärnu fashion hall, where a royal parade with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, the shop is often taken in, is dignified, but elsewhere there are more emotions - screaming bravo, getting up, wanting to thank you.
Much of the audience had to reform the same, but now they're fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people’s expectations, they are inspired!
And I like the feeling that I'm like a summer wind with my fashion creation.
We had a 50-metre-long red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, it seemed like they would never end!
Maria also does not recognize the fashion designer that the creation must be presented by a super-sale supermodel, her brings to the table the ordinary women.
Often I invite my own clients to the table - they have always come with pleasure.
It's such a fun experience, you can shine on the plate in a wonderful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my own performance myself, I'm always behind the scenes to give things the last easy way as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerves wouldn't allow me to look from the floor.
Mary is this kind of fashion designer, who wants not only to perform a role of representation, but to be within the reach of everything.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, I make most of the collection myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you discover.
I'm never far from my creation and I'm not afraid of work.
Design is not limited to, also styling, logistics, organizing, organizing - everything needs to accommodate the day of one temperamental woman.
These jobs are still going to be huge for fans.
I can’t say when my day ends, it’s just a day full of joy for me!
I still have a lot of luck - it's like an uninterrupted happily ever after: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and yet in turn compliments.
It has been said many times that in my dresses there is magic - they make themselves feel like a princess.
The satirical mob that made Maria’s talent famous all night long has remained the signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin Müürsepp U18 boys: the gun of the Estonian subgroup tournament turned against us now
I'm sorry, the old story is over.
The first thing was that we couldn’t get our desk.
And if there's such a big difference in the table, there's nothing to do," commented Estonian U18 basketball players 61:75 down for Britain, our only basketball player in the NBA, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach Martin Mürsepp.
The opponents took 28 balls from the attacking table and got so much more attacks as a result.
We were also not prepared for their aggressive defense or attack, it created.
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build up the defense.
In defense, however, they were able to hold their hands anywhere, we could not combine.
It made the crew stand.
The homework was better done.
According to Müürsepa, Estonia should make more tactical mistakes in order to take down the high eos of the opponents.
In the last quarter - we had a zero error, but the opponents already got several quick baskets.
Athleticism and the tightness that was our weapon in the subgroup tournament turned against us now.
Today we had no strength against their aggression.
Müllersep, with his care, remained at peace with Caleb, Matthias Tass.
In the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team, until today there was a unified squad.
It's a shame that you've met such an aggressive opponent before.
Tass has always been self-confident and played his own today, but it seemed that he was tired - he's been carrying a pretty big load.
But he did some really beautiful moves I’ve seen in training before,” added the coach.
Horrible numbers: the women’s basketball team threw three quarters less than 10 points in the European Championship tournament...
In the 18-year-old class, not only the young men’s EMI B-division basketball tournament in Tallinn, the ladies started all over Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland is still in the field of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but even after the third quarter it was 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took the leg off the gas pedal and the period was 16:16.
In the first and second quarters Estonia scored 4 points, in the third 1 points...
In the first two minutes of the first four, the Estonians hit two pieces, then 25 pieces, then one third, and then 21 more shots.
In about an hour and a half, one of the 47 whales was killed.
In addition, there were 2 points from 4 volunteers.
The number of ballots was reasonable at that time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland had 33 and Estonia 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia have started with two losses, on the opening day it was necessary to acknowledge Portugal’s 83:56 improvement.
NATO ships come to Tallinn to supplement supplies
Today, NATO's 1st Standing Mine Fighter Group arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit for the weekend to supplement the ship's supplies and prepare for future exercises.
During the visit, the ships prepare for navigating the sea and give crew members the opportunity to take a couple of days off.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and be ready for future operations in search of historical explosives.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the cooperation training they undertake in local waters demonstrates well our integration with the Allied forces," said Captain Arto Reinmaa, Chief of Operations and Planning Division of the Navy.
From 29 June, the Latvian navy's captain Gvido Laudups of NATO's 1st permanent anti-mining group, who took over the tasks of grouping from the Estonian navy officer, captain Johan-Elias Seljama.
The group’s flagship has been designated the Latvian naval support ship LVNS Virsaiti, which also operates as the group’s leader.
This half-year, the Estonian naval mine manager Sakala is also part of the international unit.
One of the four sub-groups of ships under NATO’s naval command is NATO’s permanent anti-mines group 1 as one of the first fast-paced reactors, which can be sent to different parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita Monastery will once again become the place where the Birgitta Festival was held 13 years ago by Maestro Eri Klasi.
This year’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic, Risto Joosti (36).
Kristo Joost: The audience will reach the opera world classics "Traviata" and "Tosca", ballet performances from the charming "Boleros" entertainment "Karlsson" and also not lacking in the plan of self-production, which this time will be the stage of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratory "Semi-Events of the Year" in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theater performances.
It is bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It’s a festival that takes power and never lets it loose again.
Because the experience that the listener gets in this upside down and mysterious environment makes human activities sounder and affects the human consciousness in a way that cannot be described.
Kristo, you're the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't Master Eri's shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it has helped me a lot.
He guided me throughout my student career and also supported me at the beginning of my leadership career.
Maybe that's why it makes it easier for me to continue his work.
Eri Klas has injected so much kindness to the Birgitta Festival team and of course it will all pass on to me.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things are going.
The great heart of Eri Klas also gave me the strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival at the Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What could excite the audience at this year’s festival that you offer special?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and as a surprise, the first ballet in the museum is written for Astrid Lindgren’s story.
It's called "Karlsson Flying".
And one curious nuance about it is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed the desire to write this work.
He's probably had Karlsson's character in mind since he was a kid.
Kristo, how do you handle all this?
Thanks to my supportive colleague.
Such work requires a support system and a lot of love, and I am fortunate to have it.
And I’ve noticed that my personal emotions don’t depend as much on other people as on myself or how I’m going to deal with every new day.
And keeping such a conscious tone, maintaining positivity, and actually smiling in the mirror in the morning, significantly raised my percentage of happiness.
Especially now this week, when there are the most important samples, I’ve practiced it particularly diligently and it works.
Smiling activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a word word.
I think people still don’t know half the things about their bodies that the universe offers them, but each one of them discovers it in a nutshell.
Right now, there's an important moment.
Do you have any rituals before you go to the control panel?
We need to change clothes for a more comfortable one.
This is a little moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest before a big show or a little sleep.
In fact, I even like to interact actively with people, even before entering the conductor’s desk.
But come all to the Birgitta Festival, here is something to discover also not to a very large opera and ballet friend!
Watch the moods of the video with Risto Joost!
New results of age assessment tests for Swedish asylum seekers have been published
In Sweden, an asylum applicants tested their age with a new approach medically. The latest test results show that more than 80 percent of those tested were rated older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing at the beginning of this year.
Tests were created to assess age more accurately during the asylum application after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to correctly determine the age of several alleged minor refugees.
Currently, the Migrationsverket has submitted 6880 cases for testing and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2481 test results between mid-March 2017 and July 31.
Eighty percent (2002) were rated 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the Institute of Forensic Medicine assessed that the test "may be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person was "probably younger than 18".
Tests are only used when a person’s age is under question.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent compared to those of the previous months.
“We don’t see a big difference from last month’s statistics, the numbers are pretty consistent,” he told The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were judged to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the Institute released 581 test results and said that in 442 cases "there are references to the person being examined being 18 years of age or older".
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of their 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases the person had directly claimed that it would be 18 this year.
This medical age-assessment method, which takes X-rays of the brain and MRI of the knee, and then lets them be analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some districts.
One of the skeptics is the endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet, Claude Marcus, whose tasks include assessing the biological maturity of humans to find out whether they underwent puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I've had a reason to think about it and I don't think the measurement method currently used should be used.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say for sure, we shouldn’t pretend we can,” he told Metro.
But Johan Göransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of inaccurate adulting of a child is low.
The biggest, perhaps around 10%, is the risk if a person is a little under 18.”

The 20-year-old Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the London Olympics, getting a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was MMI’s youngest female athlete, and a cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for the medals in the future.
The competition went well and I had a good experience.
With the first try (64.80) I immediately scored my average, with the second (62.80) I risked too much and with the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear,” said Orel after the match.
I searched for my emission and I am very happy to find it.
Anna Maria Oreli's MMI debut ended in good 18th place.
Orel did not mix the rainbow, because he trains through the winter at the TT<0xC3><0x9C> stadium.
"I'm being tortured," he said with a small smile.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house of people, did Orel see people around him or was able to turn himself off?
I realized, but in a positive way.
Everybody says it's going to add up - that's it!
If you are competing, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will be happy with MMI's debut and will have a lot of good competitions ahead of him: "I came here this season with the 32nd or the last result, I finished 18th.
This is a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and at MM - it's the only thing that counts.
I bring a good experience and someday I want to compete for the medals.
West Virginia Governor Announces Party Exchange
West Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced at a meeting on Thursday evening with President Trump that he would exchange parties.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have walked away from me," the governor said.
“Today I tell you, having prayed and pondered a lot... today I tell you, the West Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor.”
At the gathering, the joys were released.
"So I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
“As a coach, it’s time to play another game.”
Trump had previously promised a big announcement at the gathering in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the state’s only billionaire, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he is owned by coal mining in five states and that the coal business was real from his father.
Its value is about <0x24>1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that "the Governor Justice's party swap is another blow to a democratic party that would rather prevent the country from becoming better again than working for it."
"Just 15 governorships and control over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent decommissioning to a party that has run from head to to head and is unable to find a positive and connective message," RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS News.
It is no surprise that where there are many people, there are also many wounded.
On the weekend, Urmet, who is in the medical office, told <0xC3><0x95>stüle yesterday that they had to distribute the patches quite a bit.
Wilds and marshmallows are basic, out bends and slight falls.
And, of course, head, back and leg pain.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with false footwear and so problems come.
The medics have also had to help a couple of visitors with major injuries - there have been some panic attacks as well as one foot injury.
We have also made seams when a person has broken a hand or a finger.
The smaller seams we make here, the larger we send to the hospital.

Coe apologizes to Russians for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the international nicknamed lightweight force, said on Thursday that he had "excused Russia from Thursday" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it is not the time to allow the country back the sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, the name of the Russian Lightweight League, said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships that his ban on competition against the country is correct and that he is determined to fight against doping.
He apologized to “all the lightweight players who were knocked out gold and silver medals in the competitions.”
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of a ban on competition in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-backed doping in Russia.
"I think today was a very honest response, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The whole council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Alliance also recognized themselves that they had had rather difficult times and they are doing everything possible to restructure the Alliance.”
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia had accepted the criteria for its recovery.
"I think today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place, but Congress supports the working group's proposal that this is not the right time to withdraw from Russia," Coe said.
“We need to do everything in our power over the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always been based on the principle that we want to separate pure athletes from the broken system," he added.
Nineteen Russian lightweight athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF, will compete as neutral athletes in the lightweight world championships starting Friday in London.
The head of the IAAF working group, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia did not meet several criteria for recovery.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that doping control is still inadequate and trainers banned are still operating freely.
The electric car revolution significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
From the fact that the electric car revolution changes everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metallurgical market.
While miners like Glencore can say they win from one place to lose from another, smaller mining firms don’t help.
Glencore currently serves coal and petroleum, but in the future the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel will grow in the era of electric cars.
This year, contributions to the distribution of electric cars have been raised by decisions by the UK, France and Norway governments allowing the next decade to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels.
Sestap has already announced that Volvo plans to discontinue its internal combustion engine, and Tesla is bringing a cheaper Model 3 electric car to the market.
According to Bloomberg’s New Energy Finance projections, electric cars will be sold more than petroleum-powered cars in two decades.
“For some metals, it changes everything,” Capital Economics raw material analyst Simona Gambran told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a great impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, the demand for which has grown for years.
Electric cars have about three times as much copper as conventional cars, Glencore said.
Exane BNP Paribas estimates that it will increase copper demand by about five percent by 2025.
Increased demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore is gaining from the growing trend of electric cars by rising copper prices and being the world’s largest cobalt producer, Jefferies Group predicts.
According to this broker, the other winners of the race for electric cars are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, the London Metal Libraries has a cobalt weight of 70 percent.
The price increase was 37%.
This year, copper is also 14 percent tilt, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's shares in London rose by 20 percent, surpassing rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the losers side, there are companies dealing with lead such as Recyclex and Campine that need to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of plowing is batteries that power the starters of gasoline and diesel-engined cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
“This is a serious risk to gas demand unless another purpose is found to overcome the decline in demand,” said Michael Widmer, chief analyst for the metallic market at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
In the face of the price movement, the impact of the dilapidated trend has not yet been noticed.
This year's lead is 17 percent, and it's one of the top industrial metals in London.
Investors will see problems for metal only in the distant future.
“I’m not sure that lead is so bad because cheap oil keeps conventional cars in competition,” said Herwig Schmidt, chief sales officer of Triland Metals.
When the demand for lead decreases, it slows down.
This could happen in about 10 years.
In the meantime, however, tougher emissions standards mean that demand for hybrid cars is increasing, depending on the advanced lead-based batteries that often start engines, according to the International Lead and Zinc Research Organization.
Lightweight metals such as aluminum replace steel as a lighter car can drive farther with less electricity.
This explains an additional 1.6 million tons of aluminum demand as of 2013-2016.
It accounts for 2.7 percent of the world’s total aluminum production.
This trend is likely to deepen, Widmer said.
Aluminum has been tilted by 13 percent this year, as increasing demand by car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Terrace producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is partnering with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce stunning car tires.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy steel to withstand aluminum alloy.
“Super-strength steel should be a response to this development,” said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of the oil season can also bring suffering to platinum.
Mullu spent about half of this precious metal diesel engine on catalysts for cars, metal refinery Johnson Matthey said.
“Many of us now in high demand for raw materials such as petroleum and platinum may not be in high demand in the future,” said Bernard Dahdah, a Natixis raw materials analyst.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Plate manufacturers believe the demand for diesel hybrid cars continues.
Uncore CEO Marc Grynberg said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold than full-electric cars.
The great hope of platinum manufacturers in the 10-year outlook is that the hydrogen-based cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos will depend on platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
However, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
“Diesel seems to have a clear loser on the way to electric cars,” said Exane BNP from Paribas Brunet.
In July, German carmakers received a large rebound as the Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in the home city of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How Football Financial Rules Affect Neymar's Transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing uncontrollable spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish football club Barcelona to French club Paris-Saint-Germain.
Whatever the consequences of UEFA, the governing body that rules the European game and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, Paris Saint-Germain is still ahead.
The fair-play financial rules (FFP) of UEFA, established in 2011, mean that PSG must prove that Neymar’s transition was funded without a huge loss.
Barcelona was paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million (<0x24>262 million) only for the Brazilian to buy out of his contract, and Neymar’s salary is going to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of moving to the Neymar France club.
PSG is undoubtedly able to recruit Neymar and add such money to its starry list, given that the team is funded by the Qatari energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot on recruiting players, but they need to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out with their own in the football industry.
The FFP laid the foundation for Michel Platini after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into large debts in search of success actually deal with fraud and risk acquisitions if banks or owners should give up support.
Since 2011, FFP has focused on monitoring these losses instead of club debts.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and then make big expenses to make the team better and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs may suffer losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platin being humiliated in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," Andrea Traverso, UEFA FFP observer, told The Associated Press last week.
While PSG paid Neymar’s transfer clause as a one-off payment, they are able to divide that amount into parts for the purpose of accounting for the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar entered into a five-year agreement, so it is possible to show a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG received the most severe penalties for their necks with Manchester City from Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (at the moment <0x24>82 million), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and the club was required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to override regulatory financial institutions by talking about their revenues through the club’s owners.
The Qatari company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered an official revenue.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the support from the Qatar Tourism Authority PSG was inflated.
It has been said that some of Neymar’s PSG service could come from Qatar through payments made by the World Championships 2022 Management Committee.
However, PSG and Qatar in 2022 deny that Neymar could be the World Cup sender, and claim that UEFA regulators could easily reveal such a maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more cautious with regard to any attempts to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition with PSG in advance.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed, as they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG made more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million in revenue in the 2015-2016 season with a turnover of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>542.4 million.
The data for the last financial year have not yet been disclosed.
PSG hopes Neymar's arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects a growth of at least 30 percent in turnover in terms of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly annoyed by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar's transition, claiming that PSG was breaking the FFP.
"This is a clear case of "money doping" with the club and the country," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, noting that PSG belongs mainly to Katar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is a member of the American sports league, shares La Liga's assurance that the state will fund the club.
"This is a consequence of ownership rights and it has completely changed the whole football scene in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of a fair game, because the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a great player."

Today 50 years ago: a hurricane storm in Estonia that ripped roofs and windows from houses.
Hurricane called the storm of the century, which caused major damage to the West, Harjumaa and Raplamaa in particular on August 6 and 7.
During these days, wind speeds exceeded 30 m/s in the Northeast of Estonia.
My old man ran from one carding tree to another in the garden and tried to support them with his hands.
It was all dark and dark, like the end of the world.
At the time, the roofs were already flying from the houses, in 2002 the interview given by Linda Kurova Haapsalus to the magazine Estonian Nature recalled.
Linda’s husband saw her planting garden collapse.
But what do you still support with the trees, where you can withstand such a storm?
The sea came out of the window, squeezed into water from the window," said Linda, who lived on the street in Haapsalus Kalda.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the perron roof of the railway station had flew 20-30 meters away, Linda only saw it the next morning, like most haphazards.
According to locals, the trees behind Paralepa were lying on the ground, some completely long, some half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm passed through the beautiful old trees with a sting and a tear like war.
West Virumaa was not particularly severely affected in comparison to West Estonia in the August 1967 storm, but there were significant damages there, wrote Virumaa Teataja in 2007.
Haapsalu Lossipark and Padis Park were sacred from the ground up, but also our parks were severely affected.
In Tallinn, the wind was measured at speeds of up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
On the evening of August 6th, in Tallinn, a small document card was shouting: “Mom, mom!
The chickens are in the air and can't get down!", wrote Virumaa Newspaper.
The Põl<0xC4><0xB1> village building, located in the countryside, was destroyed during the storm so much that it was decided to be demolished later.
The constructions of the ski jumping tower in Turin, which were no longer restored, were not resisted by the Augusti tower.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star newspaper wrote that the cleaning of cities and settlements from fallen trees and their vomiting is slowing, and that residents could be involved in the cleaning work.
Fruit crops were also severely affected by the storm, and the newspaper reported that "partisan organizations must be both an incentive and a guide time for regulatory and crop reform work."
Hurricanes can be mentioned if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record for blowing wind in Estonia remains from November 2, 1969, when Ruhnul was measured at 48 m/s wind speed.
On the island of Vainloo, the measuring instrument collapsed, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The Secret of Clean Beaches: Night Cleaning and Bad Beach World
The cooler summer climates also mean a smaller cleaning boat on the Tallinn coast.
“If there is no, there are people on the beach, and if there are no people on the beach, there are no people.”
Kayaking on the North-Tallinn Stroom beach.
They are offered melodic competition on low turns with a sloping tractor that slopes down the stripe on the beach.
In fact, the last seven centimeters of sand sweeps through it, harvesting seaweed and rice left behind by humans: bottled pots, cigarette icons, and more.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If the weather is nice, there are people on the beach, and if it is not, there are no people,” says Aleksandr Usov, Head of the cleaning of the beach in Haabersti Administradus.
It’s 6:30 a.m. and the beach is busy cleaning, because at eight o’clock the place needs to be in order for people.
We've been working at the office since 4:00.
In addition to Stroom, he keeps an eye on Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and Pikakari beaches in Palyasaare.
The garbage has decreased.
Years ago, it was much more.
People are already able to appreciate what is being done for them,” says Usov, who has been cleaning the beach for 15 years.
Before that, when something new was put up, it was already broken the next day.
What’s on the beach is already being held.
Pure beach price
One of the biggest works on the Estonian beaches is the cleaning of sea litter on the beach.
For example, 400,000 tons of this coastal season must be transported to Pirita beach.
"It's an incredible amount," Usov said.
The second big category is garbage, that is, everything that people leave behind.
A half-kilometre of river banks have eight large garbage containers, which need to be emptied three times a week.
There's so much rubbish.
However, colder summer climates have meant that garbage is about a fifth less than otherwise.
The third type is the leftovers.
Most of the time, it's children's clothes.
This time around, the USSV has blown out a dozen model cars from the sand.
These will remain the owners waiting for the beach line frame.
"They usually come out more, but it's a normal harvest." He already knows that soon he will find them again from the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to immerse them again in the sand.
The garbage will spread
Erika Scholler, representative of Haaberst’s administrative services, admits that the trimming of the tractor is disturbing locals.
Noise, which lasts from hours of the night to early morning, confuses people living nearby and.
This job is impossible every day.
In one month, the beach must be crossed twice.
“If we don’t do that, the city will punish us,” says Scholler.
But like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu, the goal is to get the beach of Stroom under the international blue flag quality label.
“Compared to Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that beaches are maintained,” says Scholler.
We have more sand and rocks and harder to cut.
There is less rubbish on our beaches than anywhere else in Europe.
Hearing the talk about rubbish on the beach, Martin, who lives near the beach of Stroom, uncompromisingly enters into a conversation circle of journalists and cleaners, highlighting the current shortcomings of the beach.
There's a picture of the morning everywhere.
The problem is with the birds and bottlers who have pulled the garbage bags into the vicinity,” Martin said.
While it’s hard to expect people to be able to change their current behaviors, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about the garbage bins and put on them, for example, blankets to prevent at least the birds from re-energizing there.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of the Stroom beach.
It’s clear that the city will take care of it.
With children’s playgrounds, lighted and freshly paved roads, it has become more pleasant.
It used to be that skating was only possible on one road,” Martin notes.
Treasure tank findings in Stromom: coins, only coins
In the morning, a 40-year-old man named Dimitri has been using a metal detector on the beach.
He doesn’t think he will find anything worthwhile today or in the future.
Sea lions are not good enough for this.
“I’ve been dealing with this for a year and haven’t found anything valuable yet,” Dmitri says.
As a hobby, Dmitri’s treasure chest contains some euro coins, bottles and also dangerous nails, which are later thrown in the garbage bin.
Usually there are coins.
"There are usually no gold, rings, and other legs," says the treasurer.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the previous level, as weak economic growth and inflation slowing have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain lethal, as households’ earnings have put interest rates on hold.
The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policy makers voted in favour of keeping the 6:2 rate at 0.25% and fewer members demand a rise this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its growth forecast for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure on household incomes will remain, as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in the fall.
At the same time, the Bank noted that the increase in rates will be necessary to control inflation due to Brexit over the next couple of years, and financial markets may need a higher rise in loan costs than expected.
Members also voted a year ago in favour of the partial withdrawal of the market-producing mammoth package from the economy as a result of Brexit.
The bank will end a timely financing scheme in February that will provide cheap financing to banks, although it said that it is now expected to offer a <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion bid, which is <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision, the bank said: "The MPC's central forecast for GDP will remain ineffective in the near future, as the difficult situation of real households' incomes will still have an impact on consumption in the future."
On the terms, it was reiterated that to mitigate inflation, it was necessary to "draw some strain on monetary policy" and to a "slightly greater extent" than expected in the markets.
The stock market is currently forecasting its first rise in the third quarter of next year and its second in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all kinds of jumps are gradual and limited.
The Bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to the May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for growth of 1.8 percent in 2018 remained.
After this news, the exchange rate of the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
However, it fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators, which have summed up growing expectations of GDP growth in the second quarter, rising from 0.2% to 0.3% in the previous three months.
The bank says growth will likely remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will start to grow slightly.
The bank’s latest inflation report gave few reasons to delight households suffering from rising inflation and poor wage rises, saying that the situation is going to get even worse before it gets better.
It added that monetary policy cannot prevent the impact of revenues over the next couple of years, but at the end of the three-year forecast, a noticeable recovery in wages is expected.
Due to the low pound, the growing demand for British production also stimulates the economy, which partially compensates for the lower costs of consumers.
The decision comes a year after the rates were reduced to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU referendum, which led to a sudden weakening of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully breathe into prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank’s last decision, there was a growing demand for rate hikes, as inflation had increased pressure on households in turmoil; in July, three policy makers demanded a rate hike of 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank’s message was expected and expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2% target was due to a completely weak pound.
Coreco mortgage broker Andrew Montlake said: “Given the recent decline in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming more and more competitive again as lenders crave jobs and hope to end the year positively.
The stock market seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are beginning to end, as refinancing, often free of charge and low rates, has become increasingly popular."
NHS prescribes HIV-induced medicine for 10,000 people
Patients have access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment since September after the Supreme Court held a battle over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England reported that national health care is now making an estimated 10,000 people available for Pre-Exposure Pre-Prophylaxis (PrEP) during the initial three-year clinical trial - a tablet that is administered before intercourse and which has shown a high risk of infection in people with a lower risk of infection.
The NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the Supreme Court of Appeal backed a ruling last year that the NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite the authority’s own claims that the drug should be financed by local authorities.
NHS England CEO Simon Stevens welcomed the move announced on Thursday as "new massive intervention," while the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as "a turning point".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October, more clinics will be added before the program will be launched everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a medication that is taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are sufficient amounts of certain medicines in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
You can take these medicines every day or at least two hours before the intercourse.
Suitable candidates for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and cannot be treated.
Clinics identify suitable people who are willing to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people, and those whose HIV-infected partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their desire to participate in the local sexual health clinic participating in the program.
The program costs <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to get the medicines this week after an international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the actual potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of who the drug is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: “This new comprehensive intervention should complement and strengthen the wider and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another step forward in more than three decades of fighting one of humanity’s biggest health problems.”
Deborah Gold, executive director of NAT, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted correctly for those who need it and belong to the risk group, offers the opportunity to change the UK HIV epidemic.
Since September, high-risk people in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and reliant on negotiations with a partner through this NHS-funded clinical trial, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “It is now crucial to ensure that the clinical trial over the country is delayed and that no member of the HIV-risk group is left behind.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial has been procured, we are on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.
Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and severely delayed after months of delays and government legs drag.
Evidence shows how much change this drug can lead to the prevention of HIV and the cessation of the spread of its life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that the clinical trial be implemented as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us closer to halting the spread of HIV in society.”
Electricity prices in Estonia rose 12%, while in Latvia and Lithuania fell.
In July, the exchange price difference between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June, Elering said.
The main reason for the price difference is the wealth of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia, the average price of electricity was 34.33 euros per megawatt hour last month, and the price rose 12 percent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by 5% to 36.27 euros per megawatt hour.
The price in Finland was EUR 34.17 and the price of the Nord Pole system was EUR 26.37 per megawatt hour.
Prices rose by 12 and 7 percent, respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved 75 percent of last month’s hours towards Estonia and 16 percent of Estonia’s hours to Finland.
The remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not take place the next day.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity moved 99 percent of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 percent of the hours had the full transmission capacity in use.
According to transactions on the last day of trading in July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the price of electricity in August could be around 34 euros per megawatt hour and in September 37 euros per megawatt hour.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting electricity production rose last month and the transactions were priced between EUR 5,04 and EUR 5,47 per tonne.
High-rise living - semi-detached and smart design tips have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a space home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate developer, exchanged her large Knightsbridge home for an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
Located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, the fact that Joanne hasn’t packed her bag and sold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my former partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," Joanne said.
“I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and it had the same high fences.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day.”
From the first visit, this 93-square-meter apartment has undergone a complete curve of innovation.
At first it was an apartment with one bedroom and a complex layout - to get to the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a warehouse and a half-floor to take advantage of the high beds.
"I wanted high beds, large windows, a lot of light.
These were my demands,” he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi Notting Hills, an architecture and design studio Duck & Shed, to take advantage of the 3.8 m high buildings and build a home that would not be just an object of development, but a place where Joanne could live.
At the same time, it was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a half-room where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
“Metal structure is quite complex,” he explains.
“We had to rearrange the spaces so that they were placed on top of each other without having to worship.
It wasn’t just the construction of the platform, but we used the steel structure to make both the upper and lower space heights right.”
This setting enabled Erfan to create two full-height rooms in space apart from one another with many dramatic elements.
The semi-floor opens with an ancient brass light to the glamour living room under the Retrouvius window.
Mirror-surfaced furniture, silver details and Serge Mouille’s retro strap light emphasize the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, space and lighting.
Mirrors are attached to both ends of the short corridor to make it feel longer.
In the kitchen, the back of the mirror leaves the impression of a second window opening in the room.
At the entrance, the mirror cupboard offers a storage space for all Joanne’s food dishes and glass requirements.
The living room adds charm to the possibility of closing the kitchen area if it is not used, creating a more glamorous room of imagination.
The kitchens are nothing new.
In this kitchen, however, there is a unique fact that it is a garage-type lifting door.
"There was a little design aircraft in it," explains Erfan's steel-sponsored MDF door.
"She has a counterweight, so it slips very easily when it's postponed."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"At the end of the day, the floor area is what you sell - or what gives value to real estate," Erfan says.
"The real estate agent enters the room in an outdated form and makes calculations based on the surface of the floor."
Here they have been able to increase the floor area, while using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
“Materials are what you touch and help to build an emotional connection with your home,” Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical wiring on the wall.
It’s important, but it doesn’t make the heart sound louder.”
This shows that good design and increased surface area will help make something quite amazing from an ordinary apartment.
Actually, they can cause a sudden desire not to leave, as it happened with Joanne.
Dane Jensen is a Chicago-based skyscraper who competes with a colleague for his job.
Don’t count the amount of money earned, besides forgetting any ethics.
His wife and three children are only seen by a man in the early morning and late evening.
In the first half of the film, I found myself thinking that this is a version of the business world of "Kardmaja" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's spokesman is similar.
However, the more the film goes on, the less the framed element remains, and the moralizing intention of the filmmakers is becoming more and more apparent.
A life-changing experience for the protagonist is the development of a son with cancer.
There is now a choice between work and family life.
The son, who dreams of the Architecture Office, makes his father's walks to the big buildings of Chicago think about things that are really important, such as faith, goodness, love..., not even the twin tower disaster.
After the third scene, where the son opens his father’s eyes, it appears that the filmmakers have left the goal of getting the audience to cry for sure, because even the most bent-hearted viewer can’t hold back the tears while seeing the suffering of the sweet cancer boy.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation seems completely hopeless, the father finally understands the morale of his work and does a good job for an old man looking for work.
Now I'm betting on myself in terms of betting - if a movie has a happy self, then I'll premiere my transparency after the movie with a coffee, but if I'm wrong, then the screenwriter can thank you for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a suspicion that I'm out of coffee - when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man sneaks into the hallway towards the hallway.
However, the son has recovered wonderfully, and although his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can also feel good - I can already pretty well predict the end of the American drama!
In honor of the truth, the film is well-designed, all the necessary elements are present.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and morally beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I think this movie will bring in a good one.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to limit the president’s media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can handle it, too.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit President Trump’s flow of information, including news, in the hope that it will keep the chief in a level playing field.
Here's breaking reporter Josh Dawseylt:
“When White House new Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with senior officials on his first working day, he raised a key issue at the White House, which he planned to solve by getting bad news into the president’s hands.
"Kelly told officials that information must be passed through him, whether on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he shared good information with him."
Kelly’s diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it, too, and they’ve failed to keep an eye on Trump’s media consumption.
President Trump’s relationship with television has been going on for decades, and even now that he’s at the White House, his television habits have not gone away.
“When Trump’s candidate was angry after an unjust media era, he was rewarded to show that he was also honest in influencing publications,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that “the key to steering Trump’s Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption also includes a praise song.”
All right.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter usage habits have ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaigners know something that the rest of us don’t know that Trump’s whims would have been even more flammable without their intervention.
We probably never know about the rays that Trump has not posted.
If his helpers were able to save him from trouble or a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from consistently creating polemics.
Part of the problem lies in the fact that people in the White House, consisting of rival clicks, are exclusively trying to promote their own interests by transmitting to Trump material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be reliable.
Reflecting the whole story, Politico wrote to the president in May about the tendency of advisors to feed information of strategic value.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is the following:
"Current and former Trump subordinates say that Trump may react to the negative press, especially with a detrimental effect, explosively, with a keen interest in disclosing their source.
The same happened at the end of February, when someone gave the president a grievously printed copy of the GotNews.com article on the internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, accusing staff deputy Katie Walsh of being a "source for several churches" in the White House.
It doesn’t matter whether Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter for some reason, or that he has not provided any specific evidence, or that he has also made false accusations in the past and taken them back.
Trump read the article and began to come from the subordinates about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that then-Chef of staff Reince Priebus and White House chief of staff Rob Porter "have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting Trump's incoming documents."
How did it work out?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he turns out to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his aides are still competing for influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad in the capital will not be allowed to perform.
In the centre of Tallinn, there is a lot of foreign music.
Those who talked to The Night Fire admitted that they were playing in the old town without the city's permission.
First, we found three street musicians who had brought with them the same number of dogs near the gates of Estonia.
It was clear that the musicians dressed in rasta patients and explosives were backpackers who would take a shower for berries.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the company played a story with a fun rhythm at the accordion, while a man next to her invited three balls in the jonglier and the passers-by closer.
The third man was sitting next to them in a backpack and smoking a ready-made pellet in the heartbeat.
These three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing people.
Playing the accordion with Noemi and jogging the balls, Bob said they were playing on the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the show was to collect the ticket money for a ship heading to Finland on the same night.
When asked if they were asking the city to allow them to go to the old town, Naomi and Bob shook their heads.
First, we didn't know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple and are usually given permissions for a month or something like that.
It doesn’t make sense to pay for it,” Bob explained.
When we came back to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were with the musicians and were driving them away.
The village moved with backpacks and dogs to the intersection of the Viru Centre to see the good fortune.
There were also three half-dozen young people on Viru Street, one playing the violin, the other playing the clarinet and the third carrying the electronic piano.
“We’re here to offer people entertainment, to spread music and fun, and to make money for fuel and living,” said trio pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that the municipality must have permission to perform.
“Of course we don’t have it,” he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, then there is no problem.
“Of course, if the police come, we’ll go elsewhere, but we have to try,” he added.
Eesti Bank bought bonds for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>149 million in July under the public asset purchase programme of euro area central banks, while the central bank’s bond portfolio increased to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4.36 billion.
The central bank will not publish any more details of purchases.
President of the Estonian bank, Hardo Hansson, in response to the consultation of the members of the National Assembly, explained that the Eurosystem’s reserve purchase scheme covers three different purchase programmes: financial sector covered bonds, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPPs).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to inspire investors who sell bonds to invest money elsewhere.
The impact of purchases decreases the yield of lower-risk assets and this motivates investors to take greater risks.
As a general rule, each central bank purchases its own government bonds under the Public Sector Debt Purchase Programme, while other government bonds are not purchased.
Since the Estonian State has not issued the bonds, the Estonian Bank shall make the so-called replacement payments within the limits of the volume allocated to them.
Central banks also make adjustments in countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
Eesti Pank generally buys bonds from European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank will purchase bonds as part of the mortgage purchase program from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering bonds were also purchased, but Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering bonds from June 2016.
On behalf of the euro area central banks, both Elering and Estonian Energy bonds will be purchased by the Finnish Central Bank from June.
Residents reject Krabi and return to “Millionaires’ District”
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands have been confronted again with decisive migrants who have ignored the excavated crawls of the House of Representatives to win back the field away from their villages.
R<0xC3><0xA5>nduri has parked their 20 trailer villas on the grounds of a wealthy "millionaire district" near Solihull Street, which was baptized.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks after they were only ejected from there in May, without letting themselves be confused with the crawl that was digging in to prevent their intrusion by the assembly.
The tactical group found a weak spot on the defensive borders, pushing their vehicles through the unobstructed part that had been left behind.
The people of Maruvi have written to the Solihull House of Representatives, saying that the House of Representatives is "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after being expelled from Bentley Heath, where they killed passers-by with stones.
The Assembly must be ashamed to act because they have been used to deal with the problem.
The bandits were there in May, they had to leave and now they're back.
They came to us last night, probably even more today.”
He added: “Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by acquiring long barriers to protecting its parks.
I live in Streetsbrook and I’m not happy that I have to continue to pay the fee if the fee cannot even be prevented by the fee.”
One local resident, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said: "It's ridiculous. We just saw the last of these migrants leave, and a new outcry is already taking place.
This time, the number has grown and even a horse has been seen in the realm of memory.”
A spokesman for the Solihull Committee said: "We are aware that there is an inadmissible camp in the country near Streetsbrook Road, and we are working with the Solihull Police. We are taking the necessary legal measures to get them to move as quickly as possible.
Collecting evidence will be of great help if as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them.”
The weekend festival will also be visited by Culture Minister Indrek Saar, who is pleased that Estonia has been able to bring real world records.
Asked why the Weekend festival is so important for Estonians, Saar answers that it should be asked to all those who enjoy the three-day talk of the festival fully.
However, he realizes that real perpetrators of his area have come to Pärnu.
"Looking at this level of artists that have been able to bring to Estonia, it will bring home the absolute tip of this genre of music - this is often not the case in our country," says the Minister of Culture.
Which artists perform at the festival, however, the island itself speaks most?
I consider myself relatively old and for my kind of old men, Armin van Buuren is certainly one of the most experienced artists who got up last night.
According to his record rotation, all of us have rotated on their own at some point,” he says.
However, he will bring out several more names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course also our own Estonian manufacturers: starting with NO<0xC3><0x8B>P and they can be read a whole row.
In reality, this concentration of known names is very high,” he says.

Audi upgrades up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in the midst of crisis for automakers
The day before the announcement, BMW said it was offering software for more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to BMW, the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including BMW's home city Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce the emissions of diesel engines.
None of the companies described these operations as revocation.
European car manufacturers have been enthusiastically promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on carbon emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide released from diesel engines is considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
In addition, the cost of equipment installed to neutralise the emissions of diesel vehicles in the automotive industry will increase, making it difficult to keep the prices of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of bending the government of powerful car manufacturers and negating the signs referring to the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen’s mistakes, which silenced the use of so-called fraud equipment, which allowed to adjust the emission performance of the car to conform to the regulations during testing, but retreated under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the Audi motor development thermodynamics unit was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and may go to court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany, when authorities accused Audi of installing the system to avoid European emission requirements by expanding the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could be a big hope for Volkswagen, a luxury car manufacturer that generates disproportionately much of Volkswagen’s profits.
Estonian schools will receive European Union flags for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20,000.
The Ministry of Education intends to purchase the flag of the European Union to Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the presidency.
In total, the dimensions of 105x158 centimeters of the European Union flag can accommodate 570 educational institutions.
The flags are intended to be exposed indoors, they must be made in high-quality printing technology indoors also with tunnel sealing, the ERR news portal mediates.
The label of the flag bears the following text: "Kingdom for Estonian schools to commemorate the first presidency of the Council of the European Union of Estonia.

Reporter's Murder Emphasizes Growing Emergency in Mexico
The Riodoce staff usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the latest chaos in the Sinaloa state, seeded by organized crime, corrupt officials, and endless drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They are told that it is important to change your routine.
Two parent journalists discuss which seems safer: either bring the children to the office that was the target of the 2009 grenade attack, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the front of the board: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They ask reporters to provide the names of each column without the need for proof, enough of impressions and input.
A full list of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being paid by the government or cartels, making it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
There are no breathtaking periods of violence, and the more dead bodies across the country, the more journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, have been sworn in by President Enrique Pena Nieto since he took office in December 2012, and at least 25,589 journalists have been killed in the aftermath of the death of President Enrique Pena Nieto.
Among the latter are their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence gives a deep feeling, although his presence can be perceived everywhere on the Riodoce building facade hangs a large picture of the middle finger showing Valdez along with the letter "Justice" and two 30th-century reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear a T-shirt with a collar on his shoulder.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, sleepiness, paranoia.
While in 2010 a separate public prosecutor was created to deal with journalists’ cases, only two cases were taken into account by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders, which amount to thousands, journalists’ murders rarely go to court.
Riodoce will continue to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data of the assassins and the fairness of the security meeting, Ibarra said, there is no much benefit.
“It’s a waste of your time here at the meeting,” he says.
"Until you know the reason, you shame everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive just a few blocks before two men stopped him in the red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and shot 12 times. This is presumably due to the name of the newspaper, which translates to "twelve rivers".
The armed man drove Valdez's car and made an accident near it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left with a wife and two grown-up children.
The rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
But on the Valdez issue, basically, there is only silence.
Since Guzmán’s arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields, as rival cliques fight to fill the power vacuum.
It doesn’t matter that the streets of Sinaloa are thrown down every day by a few or several people, or that the ruins are plentifully adorned by the double-decorated mausoleums of drug kings, which are larger than many living homes.
Let us forget for a moment that the period of peace refers to the fact that only one cartel runs the offshore state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was deeply aware of the dangers associated with his work, Riodoce co-founder and CEO Ismail Bojorquez, 60, feels enormous guilt that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes the killing was promoted by two mistakes.
The first of these was the publication of an interview with the name-named Damaso Lopez, who competed with Guzmán’s sons and was in the military.
This piece of letter could have angered the boys by suspected gang members buying all copies of the publication as soon as they arrived in the newspaper compartments.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after the handwriting took place in another newspaper report in the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would exist forever.
He worked as a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling <0x24>50 shares.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloa "was impossible to deal with journalism without touching the drug problem".
For a long time, the newspaper gained a sense of its bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish powerful studies without fear of censorship and readers in a blurred print that they were able to read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its Latin American reflections.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKP) for his courage to follow the Mexican narcotics wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said, receiving the AKP award.
Last October, he told the TV channel Rompeviento TV in an interview that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
“You have to take on a task that comes with a press team, and the second option is to play stupid.
“I don’t want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn’t tell you what was going on.”
The Riodoce Collective misses Valdez, a joke who screams like a madrus, a friend who kindly shares embusses and advice, a teacher who knows how to survive.
They relied on their routine.
He always wore his coat.
He went across the street from the office to El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love became fateful to him.
His death has also made them question themselves how to do their job best and stay alive.
"They don't like being bullied by those women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things should not have been touched," said Bojorquez.
As a result, even at the best of times, you have strong self-esteem and self-esteem.
Confidence in your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the news can be cheated ... and so it happened to Javier".
He and others say that the old rules in Sinaloa no longer apply, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros or other states that are home to the toxicity of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees gathered for security training, cell phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before it was revealed that only nukes sold to governments were used to track journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers were looking for relief from 40 degrees Celsius.
The government appointed them to oversee the Riodoce office, which is located in a four-storey building in the Culiacan middle-class neighborhood.
Some reporters sneered over whether these police officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers whom the governor himself deemed unreliable.
Several months have passed since reporters have travelled to mountainous lands where control is de facto in the hands of drug lords.
This week’s edition of Riodoce covered three main topics.
One of them was the murder of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavezi's brother in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor’s home town.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows the restaurant is both the appeal of drug dealers and the authorities.
Reporter was informed by public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician who belongs to the current Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated almost all levels of politics during the last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been charged with widespread reflection in cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how Guzman’s son, named El Chapo, escaped the military.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched the Valdez column to get information about the kidnapping from the best source.
“Before we would have known what happened,” said Villarreal, 46, whose bodybuilding has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been interrupted."
The Valdez office has become a warehouse for labels and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and the editorial staff has become something they have never been able to expect from activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez caught a couple yet and went to the local prosecutor’s office the next morning for a demonstration for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacán three days after Valdez was killed.
The body has been found burned and according to officials, it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists have become more vocal across the country and are criticizing the phrase "SOS press" as an organised protest on pedestrians and buildings.
On this day, President Bojorquez is in Washington, trying to raise international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death in a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the officials of snobbing and killing journalists for telling the truth.
Afterwards, he asked for the government’s actions to be reflected elsewhere, worrying that his anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are "limited to" organised crime, co-accused civil servants and indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narcotics Journalism, he wrote that reporters are killed not only by the drug forces, but also by politicians and security forces who are involved in organized crime.
The media surveillance group Articulo 19 owned more than half of the attacks on police and civil servants last year.
"In Mexico, you're going to die because you're forced to shut up," Ramirez said.
The killings are obviously bloodthirsty.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found along with a letter, which was probably signed by the Los Zetas cartel, "I'm here for my reporters."
A computer keyboard and earplugs were lying next to him.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after their correspondent Miroslav Breaki was assassinated in March.
Others continue as did the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of their president in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke to the drug cartel in public with the headline “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have come from home countries or even from the country.
It's a nervous decision.
It is difficult to find work on the axis and they still have to keep the streets closed to avoid threats.
And sometimes they are being helped, as was probably the case with photographer Ruben Espinos, who was murdered with four women in 2015 in one apartment in Mexico three months after being released from Veracruz.
Those who stay in place and continue to work have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that reflecting on the drug business frightens him.
"Mexico is on its way to hell and that's why I started to be a reporter," he said.
On a recent Friday afternoon, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodoce’s editors were sitting in front of the office on a walk and squeezing beer when all of a sudden all the phones began to vibrate.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people were confirmed dead in future exchanges between rival wealthy and security forces.
The escalation of the war continued, as promised by several messages left by cartels found in the region.
On the sidewalk, reporters posted the news using a mobile phone to Riodoce’s website.
The next day we needed a change.
The sirens were crying over another future shift in the area.
Bojorquez hid from the guards to see if they were guards.
When they were afraid, they didn’t show it at least.
Under the mass portrait of the founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger is to be seen throughout Sinaloa, Riodoce employees edited in his footsteps.
"How could you think of closing," Bojorquez said, "if the same day that Javier was killed, he asked the trainee to send him to report on the streets?"
Dinosaur uses protective color to prevent enemies
At first glance, it looks like a form, though quite scary.
Scientists have now revealed the first findings related to the existence of the incredible nostrils size of a Canadian dinosaur that has been so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Dinosaur Mona Supplement".
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that his skin covered with velvets was reddish-brown in color and his past had been somewhat "sweet".
A report published in the journal Current Biology described the existence as "the best preserved dinosaur ever found" and "one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
Fossil is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation is razed by researchers who describe it as "really significant".
According to National Geographic, this vegetation is the most well-preserved type of fossil ever found.
It was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, when he was mining Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray, North Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that didn’t resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to study more closely.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, the animal was worked on to excavate a 2,500-pound (1,100-pound) field.
After all this hard work, the final result is now finally ready to be presented to the public.
"When a little bit of a puppy's eyes can almost be believed to be asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is being exposed.
"It goes as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur creatures in science history - Mona Lisa."
When examining his skin, the researchers found that this plant-eater, which is covered with stems and resembles a walking tank, was likely significantly threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
This multi-faceted dinosaur used red and white protective colors to hide itself from squirrels, and applied a shielding technique called responsiveness, which is also used by many animals today.
This, according to experts, allowed the dinosaur to merge better into the surroundings and avoid enemies, as the larger dinosaurs were likely to have him hunted.
This 110-million-year-old species of nodosaurus came into the news for the first time in May and is now a visit to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Scientists have now investigated the existence and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory at the Borealopella Mark Mitchell Museum, who was a member of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours exposing the animal as a predator.
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of the subject, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the stems on the body of the animal.
They discovered the non-responsibility – a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper side of existence was darker than the lower.
While liability is widespread, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopeta is much larger than today’s responsive animals.
This suggests that dinosaurs were hunted actively enough by other meat-eater dinosaurs to give evolution a preference to shading as a survival tactic rather than as an opponent.
However, most animals that use today's responsiveness - such as sharks, zebras, or reptiles - are much smaller and more vulnerable, suggesting that nodosaurus had to make a real effort to survive.
“The powerful hunting of a dinosaur covered with huge and plentiful snails shows how dangerous it could have been from Critical Dinosaurs,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the dinosaurs also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to research the animal to get clues about its life, including the contents of its intestine preserved, to find out what the animal had eaten for its last time.
They believe that the dinosaur crashed into a dead river, thus reaching the sea with a stream, where it swam behind the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans were likely far beyond the interior.
"This nodosaurus is truly significant because it has been completely covered with a velvet skin, while it has also remained three-dimensional, maintaining the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the Critical Age.
You don't have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it - it's enough just to kiss your eyes and it feels like he's asleep."
The Creed era was a time when the Earth's eyes were huge, two-legged, moving muscle-eating dinosaurs - the theropods.
Although all of these kings, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopella, some of his frightening predecessors were able to chase this stunned dinosaur.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5-meter) long and six-ton monster.
Scientists, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopella was threatened by death in the sea and this mummification in mud.
It was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, when he was mining the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray, North Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the most well-preserved dinosaur in the world, including skin and wrists, and it is complete from the cone to the hips.
These beings were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20-inch-long oranges came out of his shoulders.
Scientists believe that this swamp-covered vegetation was hiking through present-day Western Canada until the flooded river threatened its open sea.
However, the dinosaur’s submarine burial site helped to preserve its debris in detail.
The stoned remains of this particular specimen have been so well preserved that the skin remains still cover the dinosaur’s heads along the shady slabs.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: "This degree of sustainability is as rare as lottery wins.
The more I watch it, the more incredible it feels.
The stoned skin remains still cover the animal's necks of the pelvis.
The better front leg rests next to him, and the five legs are raised.
I can count the amount of money I have.”
How did one of the activists find the answer to the question “Whose Streets Are?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a complete shock.
Just a day after travelling to New York, this resident of St. Louis sat in an Airbnb rented room, browsing Facebook on his phone.
He suffered from his former colleague's post.
It was written, "The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he still lives on the street."
He was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on his feed, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
With longer <0x40>TheePharoah user posts were repeatedly shared on his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis area broadcast a real-time video of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's body resting on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his family.
He turned off his phone, but later in the evening, he saw a beam again, which reported a gathering of people at Canfield Drive this time around.
They shared photos of police officers and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and still held the letter "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a real-time stream where the policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a drowning dog.
In the second video, another policeman said he won a gun and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he hit himself with the thought, "That's unusual."
“It’s not the kind of murder we’re used to and what we might call typical.”
At that moment, I felt like a horrific Jew.
I was angry and I cried.”
He flew back and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 p.m., he went to his father for his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would drive at two Ferguson the next morning.
What happened with Ferrelli and Ferguson over the next three years is the central theme of the new documentary "Whose Streets?", which will be featured in theaters on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and perseverance from the point of view of those who live in this community and who have filled the streets with demands.
When Ferrell and his daughter—who wore a floral dress and had a crown that fits it on their head—driving towards Ferguson, they spoke again of the experiences and living conditions of blacks that they had repeatedly discussed before that morning.
“Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?” she asked.
"We're driving Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't take him with me," Ferrell said later.
"What's happening right now is... the culmination of what's happening in the past.
He needs to know and see and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activism and organization, and at the same time know the different stages of Black experiences and living conditions, and what we must do to get free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise her so that she does not experience personally outraged racism, she does not differ from any other black girl.
I feel like I would do him a favor if I were to protect him from this world.”
The first stop they made when arriving at Ferguson was on the way to South Florissant - a place across the police station that had become a kind of camp where activists were waiting for news about police officer Darren Wilson, who was not eventually charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who prepared lunches.
They put together the food boxes and helped the protesters share them.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was the president of the Minority Nursing Students Union and focused on food equity and health-related unequal black communities.
“I didn’t have any organizational experience.
It’s all just over.”
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met one of the film's co-directors, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was going on.
Ferrell’s head asked, “Are you trying to document what’s going on or find a story that can be exploited?”
Taoist skepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white people - come to the community and try to cut off its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson was not heard and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already struck hands with co-director Damon Davis, an artist of the region who was known for his activism in connection with prisoners sentenced to death.
His involvement made the project binding for Ferrell and six other locals who were tracked by the "Whose Streets?" team after Brown was shot for years.
“Nobody talks about us or us in this documentary, but we talk about ourselves,” Davis said.
“It was important to me how these people are portrayed, because that’s how they portray me.”
While the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was the will to show that the movement was not "a guide from the reader, but in the gathering of the community", as Folayan said - it became the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw the finished linen work.
"But I realized that doing this work and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
What’s more, Ferrell’s story emphasizes and puts the role of a central black gay woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement, who thought in social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, are gay.
“Black gay women have kept the movement in place in general,” said Ferrell, “and that’s precisely because we have to constantly fight on multiple fronts.
“Black gay women have to bear all this burden.”
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black gay women".
He argues, however, that "it is not a matter of creating some kind of equal opportunities" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the film's centrepiece because of his identity.
“He was the one who breathed the right energy,” he said.
“But it’s not a coincidence that she was right on the chest, because living at such knots as a black gay woman is very much at stake.
Its energy can be detected through the screen.”
At the same time, news cameras have long since disappeared from Ferguson, but the racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The penalty imposed on Ferrell for blocking roads at the time of the demonstration is another 2.5 years.
He describes the socio-political aviation in the region he calls home, simply as a “smoke-breaking” area.
However, he still considers the mantra to be important, which he has eaten in his memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
7 tips on how to get over the mess after a weekend party
Some lazy boys will find help after a nightmare party, even if that’s a problem.
Or, as the saying goes, “Stay drunk, stay drunk.”
But it's just an inevitable delay and a decent prank for health.
What can you do to feel better in the morning after today and tomorrow’s Weekend Trail – or any other party – and to get as painless as possible?
Yes, water.
Alcohol down and after, after a big party in the morning... or possibly even instead of alcohol.
Because the body loses a lot of fluid by consuming alcohol, it needs to be recovered somehow.
With water, minerals are also excreted from the body and sestap is good to drink mineral water.
Since after swallowing, the stomach is often irritated, it is especially good if the product is mucus-free or only slightly gassed.
Go for a walk.
Definitely it would not cost to go to the grandma to break the trees with a plaster - it could turn out to be a fateful lie.
But a simple walk will help your body remember what it feels like to be alive again.
Loading and plugging out buds is a more time-consuming way of healing.
Give your body energy back smoothly and carefully.
If you’re starting to overeat yesterday, it’s definitely not worth trying to load the mackerel with a big fat strawberries.
For example, start with fresh juice, which contains fruit juices that are quietly marketed in your body.
If the health of the luncheon already suffers, you can try, for example, the poodle.
And a little later, the villagers.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will release your body from the last water.
As I said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller in the evening, your liver must also deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and thus lose its performance.
Thus, your liver will become worse and the nuts will become worse in the future.
In addition, the painkiller does not last as long as the body does.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, do not do it on a completely empty stomach - it will irritate you with a sore stomach.
Or if you don't take a partner, you'll get along well with yourself.
It works about the same as walking, but walking doesn’t get an orgasm.
However, avoid too active pace and twisted poses - during the puncture, physical effort should be moderate.
It's a joke.
Talk stupidly to your friends-supporters, make simple fools, and laugh friendlyly about yourself and others (supports).
Laughter and laughter may not make you laugh, but they will certainly help you to tolerate the aftermath more fun.
Once upon a time, it's going to go crazy anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee are being searched for suspected in murder
According to police, a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staffer are being searched nationwide after suspects were found dead in a Chicago luxury apartment in Chicago.
According to Cook County court documents, arrest warrants were issued on Monday without the possibility of bail for 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren accused in the first-degree murder of their alleged association with Trenton H. James Cornell-Duran-Duran.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated kissing.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
The police received a phone call and found a victim who had several turkey wounds when they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment building.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was identified as dead and investigators are considering the murder as a homicide, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been working as a co-professor in microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
University Vice President of Public Relations Alan K. Cubbage said in an emailed statement that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from work and is banned from entering Northwestern University’s urban areas.
"It's now a criminal case being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is working with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant at the Oxford University Department of Finance.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an email: "We have been in contact with the UK police and are ready to help U.S. research agencies in every way possible."
In addition, the statement said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
Chicago Police Department Communications Director Anthony Guglielmi urges the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“Police have an idea where they are, but we are increasingly intensive in defining the exact location,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities will help to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from the administrator of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic hint that something had happened in apartment No. 1008.
According to the police, it was a picture of the butterfly.
According to Guglielmi, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's stay in the building.
"We believe that Professor Lathamil and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
The Grand Plaza Board of Directors sent a letter to residents: "The police are currently working on clarifying the chronology of the events and the victim's background and exploring various motives, including the possibility that it was a family record."
Top companies to help your business avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys had arrived.
The answers were often inaccurate, unused or, even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who leads the 75-member e-commerce company Madison Reed, which sells hair care products in San Francisco.
So he called on outsiders to help.
There are new types of start-ups dealing with human resources that help companies identify what their employees feel about.
By developing and licensing software, which is determined to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to make sudden inquiries, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity for the purpose of providing anonymity to the employees, and to provide anonymity for the purpose of making complaints on the hot-line of the C-line and some of the proposals.
"There are now tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed for health monitoring, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, a co-founder and CEO at Redwood City's startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by business analytics teams as well.
According to Erretti, during the three years he’s been using Glint, he’s got a much better insight into what his employees think and feel.
In addition to surveys and surveys aimed at certain teams, it provides a company heat map that provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing it to explain the reasons.
Companies have begun to understand that they need to stay up to date with their work culture in order not to become the next Uber, which has been plagued by scandals since the former employee posted a blog post describing the harassing environment where those who dared to speak were punished.
For startups like Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation and compliance could be worth more than <0x24>118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Let’s Talk Payments website.
Denver’s Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps businesses to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw growth in interest and activity in Uber’s dubious reputation this year.
Convertent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent allows companies to send customized impulse queries, collect confidential responses in real time, and view thermal maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line, allowing employees to report inappropriate behavior.
And when it comes to the executive, the complaints go directly to the board.
“The public opinion has been overlooked by the regulatory authorities,” said Convercent founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to be treating its employees badly or acting unethically, it could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and cases, even if regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Converter for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and operations and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the company headquarters phone number or e-mail address, file an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a repulsive and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday, General Counsel James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to monitor employee complaints.
Now that a company uses Convercent, however, it is possible to identify and deal with problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that have not previously reached managers operating in other cities or offices in other states.
“I’m able to get closer to employees’ holistic 360-degree experience,” said Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said companies began taking ethical behavior, values, and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with Enron’s scandal.
But only when “social media matured” did companies realize that they could not prevent their black laundry from being washed publicly online.
“Before the technology was used to track ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Converter offer their software as a service, charging the company a periodic fee for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both startups.
In February, <0x24>10 million was funded by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the capital raised to <0x24>47 million.
In November, Glint invested <0x24>10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company's total sales to <0x24>60 million.
Such investments will not come as a surprise, taking into account the interrelationship between enterprises, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that today’s employees expect more from the workplace than ever before.
In competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just bets on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they dedicate their time to a company that has a positive mission.
“When people are happy in a company, they feel that they’re being listened to and that the work they do is satisfying, they’re more committed to ensuring the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, who is a general-benefit and employee-experienced vice-president of the department.
Investors earn revenue when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
When third-party analytics tools allow to increase employee engagement and involvement, it is no wonder that they find support.
Data on employee involvement is important, according to work culture experts.
However, this data is used if the company’s supervisors do not do anything about it.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that changes will be expected.
And if the changes do not take place quickly enough or not at all, it can cause disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
“When you ask for 4,000 proposals, you need to be ready for 4,000 conversations,” said President Russell Raath of Kotter International, a consulting and business management firm, who has seen companies make a mistake in relying on too much data collection.
“Because if things don’t end, the employees will think, ‘Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, then why should I care?"
According to Erretti, Madison Reed, who is now conducting surveys of employees once a month, was able to implement the measures on the same day as the problem was reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees disappointed in the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems.
However, new data on employees will be collected on Ruby Tuesdays and it is hoped that in the long term, it will bring with it the long-term commitment of employees to the industry, which is known for its large workforce flow.
“If you’re not committed to ensuring transparency, you’re losing people,” Vitrano said.
"And when you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.”
The bright star of the euro area is the Baltic: revenues are growing rapidly
While the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching incomes from the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes, referring to the European Central Bank report.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, total economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
There is a low debt burden behind success, institutions that are recovering rapidly and a business- and free-market-friendly policy.
“The Baltic countries, together with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where real GDP per capita has significantly reached the EU average,” the central bank said.
While the objective is to make economic output per capita more equal to Western Europe, in 2015 the Baltic economies' total output per capita was only 2/3 of the average of 15 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle.
Low wages have led Baltlasians to look for better wages abroad.
While the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, locals are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvians and Lithuanians estimated that their economies are doing very well, or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, less than half of the respondents thought about the economy of their countries.
NCAA’s decision to cancel training twice a day will make Bruins’ days long
It’s almost 3:00 p.m. when the UCLA soccer team stops to chat on the edge of a new training ground on the campus of the team.
Some of them have pulled a shirt off their back, revealing their workout camp from the first day’s efforts behind sweating.
For a large part of the team, these power minutes offer noon breaks.
Players who take part in the summer courses will return to the final exams after three hours of training, before returning to the next morning at 6:30 a.m. to meet at the Wasserman Football Centre.
"The next three days are a real test for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA decision to cancel the workouts that take place twice a day to reduce the burden of players has actually made their days longer – at least until the final exams are halfway through Friday.
For this reason, UCLA’s first three training sessions were scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to fit the players into such a tight schedule.
Transitioning from two workouts a day means more days with one workout – Bruins’ workout camp start was raised compared to the previous season almost a week’s share ahead and for the first time during the Mora six Westwood seasons, training takes place during summer courses.
They will have 18 training sessions until August 20, before official preparations for the opening game against Texas A&M will begin in September.
Mora said he is in favour of the NCAA regulation change, although it adds another point to the player’s tight schedules.
“They have a huge load in three or four days and it’s a serious challenge,” Mora said.
“And they are struggling with this temptation; they are striving, they are beautiful young men.
I believe that when we arrive on Saturday and we have more time, it’s really fun.”
Once the camp is finished, UCLA will turn the trainings into closed, which is not an easy task at all, given the clear view of their squares from the nearby parking lot and the adjacent center of Luskin, a higher-class hotel that has already been made from the slopes of the gateway and the slopes of the square.
From this weekend on, Bruins's players will be busy, but Mora admitted that there may be problems with the available rooms during the season.
"We are implementing security measures," Mora said.
"It's a real concern and it's not at all an exaggeration to think that people can rent a room and film training from there.
If you have a record of training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we're using a security team there and at the 8th parking lot.
We make our best use of the existing ones.
I'm trying not to worry about it.
We have a plan in place."
The Savisaare-Ivanova Electoral Alliance, which was born in retaliation for the Central Region, Kristiina Ojuland, who was expelled from the Reformation, and Maria Kaljuste, who was forced to leave the EKRE when the forces of the private party were united.
However, tibuses will be counted in the fall, and the key question will be whether they all have enough disappointed voters.
Who's staying with Savisaare?
If the support team of Edgar Savisaare has declined, you might think of events organised in the name of his constituency.
One member of the National Assembly, some former and present middlemen and many unknown faces - can such a thing be in the constituency?
And can the reason why some loyal supporters and friends of Savisaare in Tallinn refuse to run for office be searched for the fact that the “Savisaare list” of delinquents, who are in front of them and suspected of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the municipality to a Russian-speaking crowd with an elder in Lasnamäe district; and in every sense an original computer game in which the main character, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, has to avoid the wallets and shovels on the road - that's how the 17-shoulder shovels and the 16-shoulder shovels try to get ahead of the Central
Let’s wait for the other parties’ idea of a youthful campaign.
If Channel 2 or TV3 viewers from the beginning of August look at a black box instead of entertainment, there are two options left: agree that only ETV, ETV2, ETV<0x2B>, Tallinn TV and the English-language France24 channels will be seen in the open from now on, or broadcast every month in the tenth to some television operator.
There are probably also those who at first publicly delight in the non-advertising telecom experience, but in the end, however reluctantly, pay for television footage and advertisements.
Hearing music, noisy people, and rubbish left in the streets are the unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don’t want to be a part of the noise yourself, instead of headaches at home, it’s worth going to the countryside to discover – and leave the place to sleep for a sum of money at festivals.
Washington is changing the rules of the green card.
The media quotes President Donald Trump as saying he plans a new U.S. immigration plan that will change the rules of the green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and the President supports them.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, raises wages, and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money by changing the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and will begin replacing the current program.
“The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said in a statement.
Siberian Seto youths move to the city, retirees back to the country.
Yevseyev’s Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous seto gold seafarers on the banks of the ancient Maana River.
He works 140 kilometres from home as a car driver on a gold plate near the Maana River in Kuva.
This is hard work: two months in a row without holidays for 12 hours of work and then only ten days at home and back again.
In three years at Artelli, Anatoli has only seen gold once.
“There’s a tough procedure: entering is thoroughly checked to ensure that no wine is brought in, and going out to ensure that no gold is brought in,” says Anatoli.
Mare Piho is chatting in the village of Haida with a local sect named Jaan, who has told him a lot about his family’s memories in Siberia.
The archaeological culture still preserved by Siberian settlements will also affect domestic settlements, as it is simply so breathtaking, Piho Mare thinks of the most thorough exploration of the remote settlements.
This year, his first exploration trip to Siberia will be 30 years old.
During this time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for one year.
How many of them moved to Siberia at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries to get land here?
That's an unsolved question.
I'm saying 8,000.
I figured it out based on the stories of the men in Siberia who have thought of it themselves.
It is difficult to say exactly, because at that time, up to 30 people in one group could come, but the passport was given only to the man.
The pass was given only to one, but with him were children, sisters, etc.
Look at how big this area is!
It was several times larger than the historical Setomaa.
It needed to be educated, managed in some way.
The sets came here as farmers, but their lives changed, because here they came into areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (payment), gold mining, industry.
For example, in New Petersburg, many settlements later went to work in the secret city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (the Soviet power was built by the Soviets at a uranium enrichment plant - J.P.), when it was formed.
Did you make up the majority of the population in the area at that time?
Yes, they lived compactly.
In addition, there has been a long tradition of marriage and childbearing.
Seven to eight children were common.
How different is the culture of Siberian sets and how different is the culture of the motherland sets?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of nationalism.
They also made themselves (racialists), but they always made a difference between what was brought in and what was done here.
Climate change strongly influenced the traditional clothing of the sets, because it is colder here.
Food has changed.
For example, Setoma meat was salted, but here it was simply frozen.

My relationship with my mother was spiritually strong, and it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now it's going to give the Setumaa back there, it's going to affect them.
These girls, who have lived here in families, have listened to amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to Haida village on Seto Kingdom Day at the beginning of July and lived in their homes for four days - J. P.
What's still here, it's amazing.
"The palace is super easy to come and go, because the city has a great location: at the railroad stop and at the intersection of the roads," says Reigo Tamm from Tapalt.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and culture, and the pizza can be found everywhere.
Kill a tip-top city!
There is a small island on the banks of the White River that runs through the city, where the returnees are used to celebrating the Jani Party.
“This beautiful place doesn’t look like a train window,” Reigo said.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
On the banks of the river you can have a picnic and just make a romantic - you can face the flow of the river and think of life ahead and behind.
I’ve been there walking with my bridesmaids.
After all, Tamm, an opera singer, has been on three bridges along the river practising his ariaidki: "Because this place is near the city, no one may come to the opposite unless they combine their own stories."
"From the village there is a wonderful view of Tapale, but there are also health limits where you can run, ski in winter and now, for example, you can play disc golf - the golf course is done, the tracks can be borrowed from the sports center," Reigo says.
The old pros go there with their records, of course, but I haven't gotten to play there yet.
It is likely that my colleague Rasmus Kull Tapale will have to be called the village, because he is an experienced disc golfer and has records.
He's just borrowing me!
Reigo and Männikum<0xC4><0x97>gi were inseparable from the childhood of the present opera-solist.
At least during skiing hours.
There are so many tears and disappointments left on this mountain, and you can win in my sport.
Not to mention broken skis and skis.
"The whole city is now full of construction works, all this is becoming unfamiliar," says Reigo.
Killing an old and tired cottage building, however, is a very attractive place where summer games are played.
I am glad that in 2012 R.A.A.A.M.M., the leader of March Meos, adopted my idea and had to make a summer theater with his own theater.
Although this year's theatrical season "Aleksei Karenin" just ended, on August 11th there is "Eluarkaminen" at the railway station, as an old varsity building is moved around in the 1980s.
"From August 11th to 13th, the days of the city of Tapa are days in which, in addition to the cobblestone buildings, open house cafes are awakened and a series of cultural events are held, including the national park," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city on those days.
In the small yellow house on May 1st, there has been a museum since 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are very much and the information is huge," says Reigo, a place filled with the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on railways and warfare.
Reigo recalls that when Tapal passes through all the recommended places, his stomach goes empty on the long run, but fortunately, the small town is full of cafes.
“We have such good places to eat, and sitting in cafes sometimes makes you feel like you’re abroad,” he explains.
The trained and young soldiers who come to Tapale spend a lot of time in pubs-cafés, there is a strange feeling sitting there that you are indeed in Estonia and your hometown, but there is such an international community around.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we move a lot!
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Illegal Campaign
BTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
On the morning of 1 August, police arrested a group of illegally camped people on the Sithonia peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but an investigation is underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on the free movement of tents and are already imposing harsh fines on all those who are interfering in places of rest that are not intended to do so.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Puppies are taught by dogs to break the sheep.
Hiiumaa farmers have to give the wolf again after a year's break "learning material" from their herds - it's likely that the puppies that have taught the puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, totaling 23 sheep and wounding eight, Hiiu Leht writes.
Mullu had only three corresponding numbers, 124 a year earlier.
The data of the Environment Agency are also synchronized with the data that the Hiiumaal was not born in the country, and the information of the Hiiumaa Hunting Board that this year there are two dog breeds on the island.
On Monday night, the dogs broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in Emmaste valla and wounded the remaining 18 sheep.
In the early morning of Wednesday, the dogs of Reheselja village broke one sheep in the herd and severely wounded the other, who had to be killed in an emergency.
The rules for the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear.
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law on the introduction of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOVS) and a law on plant protection.
The amendment to the Act excludes the creation of a separate data set for both genetically modified (GM) crop sites and operators, with the use of a plant health register in the future.
In addition, the obligation of the GM farm operator to have a prior agreement with a person engaged in beekeeping within the limits provided for.
While genetically modified crops are not currently being grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least until the decision has been made to declare Estonian GMO-free,” said Sigmar Suu, head of the Department of Plant Health of the Ministry of Agriculture.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account both the costs and administrative burdens incurred by the private and public sectors," Suu added.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the data set and the training for operators and operators of GM crops in GMOVS, lays down the requirements for the management of GM crops and the start-up of economic activities.
Specifically, in the case of beekeeping, the existing obligation of the GM cultivator to notify beekeepers of the start of the GM cultivation shall be replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before the start of the cultivation.
The bill has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to read this in the draft information system and, if they wish, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes affect, in particular, persons active in the field of plant production, beekeepers and the Agricultural Agency.
In the European Union, including Estonia, it is allowed to grow only one GM crop - maize MON 810.
However, so far, no Estonian farmers have been interested in cultivating GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no corn pest in Estonia, a European barbed wire that is resistant to MON 810.
Also, the varieties of this corn are grown in southern regions and this may is not suitable for our climate conditions.
For the sake of certainty, in 2015 and 2016 the Ministry of Agriculture commissioned studies to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in the seeds of various varieties of summer seeds, corn and soybeans grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples showed that the seeds did not contain foreign germs and as a result of the study it was concluded that the seeds of the varieties of rapeseed, corn and soybean grown in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
The above, in turn, can be concluded that there is no conscious cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia, and it has also been confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Matic in the form of a "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited Nemanja Maticu as a "genius" after midfielder Sampdoria made his debut on Wednesday night.
A <0xC2><0xA3>40 million Chelsea-backed player started his last pre-season game in Dublin United ahead of UEFA Super Cup Real Madrid on Tuesday, scoring a 2-1 win in the first round, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to attack.
However, having left Blues behind the pre-season Asian squad, Maticul was severely lacking in the match form and he only resisted for 45 minutes, according to Mourinho, which must definitely be corrected before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experiences, intelligence, a genius way of thinking - he has football mindsets," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, at Aviva Stadium, the other newly recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also began to quietly put their eleven beginners in place at the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but confirmed that the club has already done a "great job" by signing contracts with three of his four priority choices.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to achieve three out of four," he added.
“I’m even happier if they can make four out of four, but they’ve seen a lot of hard work for me.”
Another son of a bitch got to his feet on the GSM transmitter on August 1, and this time in Muhus.
According to Mati Martinson, a birdwatcher living in Sõrve, the first bird was equipped with a transmitter in Sõrve, and this bird is already flying around, leaving the bird’s nest and joining a large nightclub in Mullutu-Suurlahe.
This is because there is no fruit in S<0xC3><0xB8>rve, says the Voice of the Islands.
On that Tuesday, it was relatively late to ring the beards, and the sender received another beard and it was on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project carried out by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Mullu was equipped with a kitten named Mati GSM transmitter in Sõrve in Turkey.
“His actions are all visible on the internet: how he went to Spain in the winter, coming back for a while at the top of the German and Polish border, and then came to Saaremaa,” Martinson said.
British inventor of glass to install a microchip in his body to access the house and car with a handle
The British inventor became the first person in the country to install a microchip so that he could simply open his front door, access the office, and even start the car.
33-year-old Steven Northam allowed a small chip to be installed between his thumb and thumb, and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a royal anesthesiologist at Hampshire County Hospital, Winchester, to ensure the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to the microchip installed on cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam’s company also exchanges locks for houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, asking for <0xC2><0xA3>300 for one lock.
This married father of one child has now installed the technology both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which starts when he has his hand on the steering wheel.
White House Exhibition Goes to Pay Taxpayers Thousands
According to military documents released by TIME, the White House decided to fly a naval helicopter for the event marking American production last month to pay taxpayers <0x24>24,000 to the south.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, called the Marine One during the president’s boarding trip, was the key to the launching event of the American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials renewed industrial products from all 50 states on their tour.
The Connecticut-built helicopter was exposed together with a hunter from Maine, a firefighter from Wisconsin, and a lift made in Mississippi.
According to the documents of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) squadron in charge of helicopter operations, the White House Military Cabinet demanded the helicopter's presence command, or FARGO, 36 hours before the helicopter was "abnormal" for the purpose of an event in the south of the country.
"I wanted you to be aware of this, because it's an unusually high-profile event," the HMX-1 commander said in an email to his chief, the Navy's deputy chief aviation officer, the day before the event.
The message noted that the helicopter arrives on the south side of the hut on July 17th at 7:00 a.m., and remains there until the hut is cleaned between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.
Added the fact that if leaving the White House should stay, due to the limitations of working time, a second crew member will be required to fly back.
The initial flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, and the squadron's security crew remained close to the aircraft during its entire stay on the ground.
From the documents issued to TIME, it was not possible to find out whether or not your second crew was eventually needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
Documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether an event in question could violate this provision.
"We asked if it violated Hatch's law, and we were told it wouldn't break," the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have a choice," replied the deputy officer.
The White House declared the event “made in America” an official event, and Hatch’s law would not have covered it.
But even in official events, there are political subtleties.
The president supported the health reform efforts that the Senate had during the debate at the time, and praised efforts to keep government regulations under control.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents have to use them for travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for photosynthesis is unusual.
In February, Trump drew attention when a presidential plane crashed into the background at his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account tweeted messages complaining about how his predecessor used the presidential plane.
"Valgel Majal is very pleased with the show 'Made in America', which featured products from all 50 states made from American materials by American workers," White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
The HMX-1 teams often conduct outdoor experiments around Washington and on the south side to train a distance from the White House to the President of the United States with an accuracy of centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 hosted 58 test landings in the White House.
According to the official, the flight for the event "made in America" was considered to be a standard for the study flights of the month.
The squadron helicopters flew that day in addition to 11 hours for "non-President-related support missions".
According to the White House, none of the other exhibits of this event burdened the taxpayer’s wallet.
According to the representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in organizing the outdoor exposure of the helicopter on the south side.
The HMX-1 does not keep the President’s flight budget documents and the exact costs of the event are difficult to identify.
But according to the Department of Defense’s hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the VH-3D compensation rate is <0x24>24,380 per flight hour.
The squadron documents indicated the length of the flight from its base of the Quantico airport from Virginia for 30 minutes in both directions.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is much below that amount.
“The calculation of taxpayer costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading,” Walters said.
"These estimated reimbursement rates shall include personnel, maintenance and many other non-returnable costs to be taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the Defence Ministry’s compensation rates do not include staff costs, but they cover costs related to fuel, maintenance and contracts.
Former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the event at the time.
“The idea is to show things made in America this week,” Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are probably hundreds, if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked hard on.
So, of course, it’s right to highlight it.”
It’s unclear whether Trump was wearing a roundabout in a south-facing event with a helicopter, but he was sitting behind the wheel of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump appealed to Sikorsky’s representatives, throwing a joke to media outlets about the company’s products in his personal aircraft fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of their products."
Grit <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko - through the tears came peace and joy
At the 2011 MM Daegus, <0xC5><0xA0>adeikot was hit in the last field, with a 800 m leg ramp running, and was taken to the stadium with a 10-metre scooter.
Shortly before that, he had received a far-flung zero at a university in China.
In 2012, the Helsinki European Championships had an increase in the cost of injury, but at the London debut Olympics, it was ranked 23rd with 6013 points.
But the misfortune continued.
After the opening day at the 2013 Moscow World Championships, Estonia’s record-breaking long distance hockey was injured.
Two years later, he took 15th place at the Beijing Olympics and finished the Olympic standard, but it was a disappointment to the athlete.
<0xC5><0xA0>adeiko’s heaviest dam hit the ground only when he was not able to write a result at the Amsterdam EM.
I'd just like to put together one decent multi-competition once or twice.
Once upon a time," said Shadeiko.
Worse still was ahead: a month later, his Olympics in Rio was interrupted due to a stroke in the first block.
The time has come to take off – is it going to continue with the seventh race?
Is the two-day effort worth it?
She thought for a long time, but found peace.
I could think of my head clean.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that was just supposed to happen.
Fortunately, it was time to heal and clean your mind.
"I knew I wouldn't put the pill in the bag yet," says <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko of his self-cleaning.
I was able to turn the page clean and move on to the new top.
According to coach Anne Berg, it was very difficult to see the suffering of the caretaker, but he realized that the athlete must first and foremost come to a clarity on his own.
He was so dismayed by everyone.
It was hard to tolerate.
"But Gret said he won't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth," Berg says.
Now there is some kind of peace in him.
He does it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May, when <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the Götzis multi-competition.
In the high-level competition, he improved his personal top score by almost a meter (13.89) and ran in a record short run.
Then the multi-competitor felt that it was not at all a gap of abilities, but was deleted from the first round of the competition.
For years he has been guided by the words of the Mountain that <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko is a model student.
He's an athlete, he's good at training.
If something goes wrong or is wrong, he says it right away.
He feels his body and trusts his feelings.
We've got to get out of this.
I can’t say exactly what to do and follow it.
A new approach has also been found in <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko.
“I’m not the one who does the maximum in training,” he says, saying that the most important thing is to get the right reputation, because it also ensures a good result.
The joy of the next baby makes you happy.
Good emotions have also been offered to <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko’s loved ones.
Both his former coaching partner Maris Berg and his sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-competitor has received support from new non-citizens.
"It's been interesting," said Shadeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking is equivalent to “training” the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that he believes wine can train his brain better than anything else in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
His words are not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the process of "very active" wine tasting.
By smelling the glass, twisting the wine in the mouth, enjoying it and realizing the aftertaste, we put our brains at work to create a taste for the wine.
According to Sheperd, the wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but the taste arises from the way the wine stimulates the brain.
It compares how the brain “sees” colors.
"The taste is not in wine, the taste creates a wine tasting," says Shepherd.
Things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva that a person produces.
Sheperd says, of course, that wine is not meant to be drunk.
“There has to be more activity,” he says.
If you take too much lessons, the system is overloaded.
Excessive drinking can harm the brain rather than benefit – according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine are at risk of memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity.

According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the UN mission to Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Assistance Mission, said hundreds of women are running for the local council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to overemphasize the importance of women's role," she said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly represented and true to the people if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The elections and presidential elections of the local Soviets of Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban itself has threatened the electoral process, which coincides with a transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year’s elections mark the first time that power is peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysomi, the strong role of women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission in Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

From the Philippines to the World of Beer in the Heart of Fashion Fans
The bags made of beer are a summer classic, which has become a hit product in recent years, which must be hung at the end of the hand on one of the right summer dresses and which the merchants have managed to weld at the price tag according to the hit.
A bag of reddish beer is probably one of those things that have existed at any time in life and whose possession has not caused any special emotions.
It just exists, and if it doesn’t exist, there’s nothing broken.
Now, however, shoulder bags are making a real win and fashion fans have changed their fine design bags to simple shoulder bags for summer months.
This is not just a beach bag at all, but today it is as popular as a street bag, and bolder women walk with it even in the office.
Here, however, it is worth clarifying before whether such a summer look still sits or it is worth throwing a wet and yet a laptop into a slightly more official wetsuit.
The diversity of the shoulder bags, however, has made women a true summer love.
For example, when reading foreign mobile phones, the first thing that remains to be seen is that the fashion designers put the first thing on a holiday trip to the local market and buy for themselves some shoulder bags, which will then be true for the whole holiday season and which will be accompanied by the beach, the beach and the market.
Some bloggers are so eager to buy bigger bags from the market and sell or give them to their loyal readers.
At the same time, it is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so high that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go hand in hand with each other to become the happy owner of some bag.
In some ways, such madness is also understandable, because these are rare times when it is possible to buy something that has come into a state of emergency for just a few dozen euros.
True, greedy merchants have also discovered an easy way to make money here, and so the finest luxury brands also sell beer bags for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Probably so that richer customers shouldn’t feel like they’re just walking around with some cheap bags.
Dolce & Gabbana, for example, can buy over a thousand euros worth of shoulder bags.
However, the interpretation of Chanel’s shoulder bag can go out in a round of 6,000 euros.
Unlike most fashionistas, however, shoulder bags do not originate in any way from some big fashion store, but their story started farther.
In fact, the shoulder bags are said to have originated far from the Philippines, where they have spread widely without being transported.
The redness of the bag of beer is there especially the exporter and the locals very often do not see them running around.
It is said to date from the 14th century and is quite scarce with ordinary basketball.
However, since the shoulder bag does not need to be as thick as the basket, you can put patterns and other materials into them, which make the bag more personal and therefore also more attractive.
For example, recently there have been especially trendy bags with colorful spots or leather straps in them.
In particular, the shoulder bags can be sent to actress Jane Birkin, of whom the largest reddish shoulder bag has never been seen before.
In fact, he fits his shoulder bag into all sorts of clothing sets, and he didn’t even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
However, the popularity of bags today does not play a minor role in the fact that the care of them is a flower head and, unlike all kinds of other sodas, you do not have to care for them with special means, but it also triggers water and a wet towel.
As with trendy designs, brands with all kinds of interpretations have emerged in addition to their classic appearance.
For example, if you want, you can buy a reddish-brown wrist or rather a velvety shoulder strap.
However, it is worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, but on the shoulder strap.
So, what is a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, such a bag of red shoulders has been considered a classic, reminiscent of its style of basket, is open on top and has short, as well as shoulders, straps on it.

Three days ago, a missing man was found on the island.
Aare left her home on Wednesday evening in an unknown direction in the Kärla allevi.
Aare had the last contact on the phone yesterday, Friday night, and the positioning of the phone gave the man the location of the man on the West Island, the village of Joy, where he was searched for in the heart by helicopter and with the dog until early morning.
The battery of his phone was then emptied and the man could no longer be identified.
The police continued their search this morning.

GMB worries about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The trade union expects confirmation from the managers of McVitie's cookie maker of long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent about the future of investing in the Tollcross facility.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
McVitie’s owner, Pladis, said they have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the object over the past couple of years.
There, employees and trade union chairs were hired "the first to hear" when something changes in the factory's operations.
In a letter sent to the head of the company, GMB Scotland appealed to McVitie’s side to “dissolve concerns that the funding will not be used to modernise production lines”.
GMB parent organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we can’t get clarity from the head of the facility on the business needs and the future investment plan at Tollcross makes our members deeply concerned.
It has been employed by several generations of families, and the workforce is largely composed of the local community and the people of the Glasgow area, being essential to more support for decent employment in an area where there is high unemployment and social exclusion.
Therefore, in terms of jobs, wages and well-being in the east, and in terms of Brexit, rising living costs and a chronic decline in production, Glasgow needs McVitie’s company with a rapidly growing productivity.”
Pladis’ representative said: “The head of the Tollcross object received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will respond directly to it as we value active communication with employees and representatives of the trade union.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where a number of issues were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the staff that, like all the other companies operating in an extremely competitive and unsafe economic climate, we are continuously reviewing our activities - and this applies to all of our companies and objects - in order to ensure their competitiveness.
He added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross facility, most of which has gone into production lines and operations improvement.
We fully understand Tollcross as the legacy of a production facility and if there should be any changes in the operation of the facility, employees and representatives of the trade union will be the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about approaching Neymar?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up trying to attract Neymar to his ranks, making an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million for his sale. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record-breaking conquest?
This callous approach has opened the summer transition window and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current world record of overturning, which was set last season with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
When the transition is completed, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and also the world’s highest-paid professional athlete, who will receive a salary of over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week after being paid by PSG.
Barcelona is somewhat angry at both the approach and the break-up of Neymar, although a source close to the Catalan board confirms that the club has always cared for the footballer since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who are thinking about hiring some of PSG’s best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we'll step up to them and contact them," Al-Khelaif said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to sign a contract with one of our players, they will have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the border as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow Italy to leave under any conditions and that Barcelona could receive a backlash as a result of this interest by losing one of its expensive assets in the form of Neymar.
Ireland wants to build a bridge after Brexit, not borders.
"Brexit is seriously threatening to strike a heel between Northern Ireland and Ireland, the United Kingdom and Ireland," Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland after his inauguration in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made possible the free movement of current people and goods, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: to build a bridge, not borders," he said.
He said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and because it is not possible, he would prefer to remain part of the European single market.
It would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make the UK’s departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Prime Minister of Ireland said.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: “We could certainly have such an agreement with Britain.”
An alternative would be to return to customs points that would declare a historical breakdown and a political breakthrough.
“Return to trade, prosperity and peace,” the Irish Prime Minister said.
He called Brexit “a challenge for our generation” and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland’s daily life.
The Prime Minister of Ireland visited Belfast with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland.
Mart Avand, who passed his first half-length triathlon, said: "Ironman can be passed by anyone."
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltics was held in the winter capital of Otepää, when about a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries attended the Ironman competition.
The 70.3 mile distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, the first triathlon of his life also ended victoriously in March Avandi.
"I thought it was going to be complicated and in the end it was going to be complicated," Avandi said.
Despite the complexity of Avandi, in fact, the triathlon is accessible to everyone.
"It's not the distance that kills, it's the pace that kills," he said, pointing out that everyone gets to the finish at a fast pace.
Except for Ott Sepp: “From physics, everything is fine, but the parachute can’t swim.”
Avandi had been training for quite some time since February.
Initially 4-5 hours a week, but later 10 hours a week.
At 05:34:12, he reached 270th place in the overall ranking.
While Avandi lost both to Raio Pirioja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Lig (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called "prominent class" competitions.
Last year Tanel Padar, who was a "good example person" lost to Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:18:45, respectively).
The overall winner of the men's Otepää in the Ironman series was crowned by the German Johannes Molda at 3:58:27, the best of the Estonians was Ivo Grand at 04:14:09.
Among the women, Danish Helle Frederiksen won at 04:24:01, while Estonians Maria Jänenese, who lost to Frederiksen in about half an hour and became at 04:58:58.
Avandi made a 1.9 km swimming distance of 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in 410th position.
