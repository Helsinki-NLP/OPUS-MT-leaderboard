The Prague Stock Exchange at the closing of the market had a negative collapse.
After the collapse of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange recovered the losses.
The transactions of CEZ shares have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this downturn is the collapse of stocks on Wall Street.
Thus, too, we show a market reaction to the outcome of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which has refused to support the plan to stabilize the local financial sector.
Disruption of shares in Asia
Asian stocks on Tuesday experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indexes, however, over the course of the day subsequently cancelled some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Hang Seng index over the course of the day dropped almost 4%, but subsequently also a part of the losses stabilizing at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while the markets closed in Shanghai.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but eventually the losses settled at 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
“The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Currency Office.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages financial policy alone, thus without relying on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
U.S. lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to the dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is the risk that other countries will experience consequences as well.
U.S. stock strike
The U.S. parliament on Monday rejected the financial system’s support plan, for which <0x24>700 billion was to be allocated (almost twelve trillion Czech kroner).
Legislators have thus ignored President Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks on Monday experienced a strike and the main stock indexes recorded the biggest collapse in more than twenty years.
The Dow Jones index dropped by almost 7% and a similar drop in size was last observed in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it went down freely.
Congress has surrendered: the U.S. government can allocate <0x24>700 billion to banks.
Highest representatives of the U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush’s government have agreed on a broader form of understanding of economic support for the U.S. financial system.
The vote on this issue will be at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers broke the ice in a dialogue on endorsing the bailout plan in the form of financial aid for the U.S. financial system for a total of <0x24>700 million (almost twelve trillion).
But it's not said yet.
Representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting it.
The support plan for the financial system will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Banking and Financial Committee of the House, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to economists, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of reviving financial markets.
Afterwards, however, there will be a return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, the aid of the markets will be reached.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a big step forward.”
"We have clarified our different views on the form of presentation of the package for stabilizing the market," Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
According to the same, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Legislators’ delegates met on Saturday night with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to finalize the government’s finances.
These funds should be used to acquire non-legislative mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead financial companies to serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
“We are in the process of concluding the definitive agreement on the plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.”
“The recovery plan still needs to be put forward, but I think we are,” Paulson said.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis falls heavily on the stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final deal in Congress even before Sunday.
That is, they want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, who are, in order of time, the first to influence the market on Monday following the decision of Congress.
But for now it is not clear when the two Houses of Congress will vote on the law and even whether negotiations will be able to stop at the last minute on some issues.
Legislators expect it to be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount foreseen for the support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first <0x24>350 billion should be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has asked.
But Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum if it feels that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next <0x24>100 billion and after the finals 350.
Bush appreciated the progress made in the negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress can override his right of veto.
Despite these changes, the program’s basic thinking has remained, i.e. getting the finances to buy passive mortgage values, the price of which has fallen due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We've processed everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday and the Senate Monday," the Republican senator said.
US President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday’s positive development and appreciated “the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of gold parachutes
The chairman of the Senate banking committee, Christopher Dodd, the main spokesman, said the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget of cuts, the breakdown of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called gold parachutes for the executives of companies participating in the program and is setting up a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and have made a big step forward towards the deal that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans as well," Paulson said.
The plan counts on help to homeowners who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate new mortgage rates that it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly expenses on rates for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's why we don't know how and for what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for how losses will be shared between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week for the website iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
“More importantly, this week, congress representatives have reached an agreement on the support of this plan and are baptizing it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this most important moment,” Marek said.
Duel to the Last Blood: MP3 Players vs Cellphones
We will advise you how to choose
While almost every phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
This makes it clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
However, there are many reasons why you need to find an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy a high quality expensive records to listen to us the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
First of all, these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
But if your shelves are crowded with hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls, you probably dream of a rotary disc like that.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
There are also prices and quality categories here.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for a reader 8,000 kroner, as well as a Pink Floyd fan may hardly digest the market’s 20 kroner headphones.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It is up to you to decide the life of the batteries.
Some high-quality music players manage to do much more than simply read music, which is something that mobile phones don’t even mistakenly do.
There is no other current device as universal as the cell phone.
Next to the primary functions, phone and text, can read music and video, record both and have a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe even can navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and palms you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle because no refrigerator can make the grid and no television can photograph anything.
The versatility of mobile phones also brings downsides.
The more functions you use on your phone, and the more the display indicator will require the charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few mobile phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As for the low-cost phones that can last for more than a few hours.
If you’re still adding, from time to time, some calls, looking for another charger to work for safety, this also applies to the more expensive devices.
But you won’t have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst lasting at least 9 hours of continuous functionality with a charging.
Another problem arises when downloading music to your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited portion of devices have the universal USB port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Certainly the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory players are able to do it without an adapter for the minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except for some exceptions (iPod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and readers create themselves a media library sorted by the names of the performers, the name of the album, the gender, or the user's classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, be especially interested in the battery strength, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly the ease of use.
If you need music especially from the background and you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram, you just need a mobile phone that reads MP3.
This can be done now, clearly on any mobile phone.
You don’t have to worry too much about what formats your cell phone or reader recognizes.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music coming to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common ones, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic for buying a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is poor and is usually limited only to hit the moment of the radio.
The prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this mode of selling music (either via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phone behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to some blur in their pocket while the MP3 player remains forgotten at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry behind the headphones or at least the wireless headphones.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small portion of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest benefit of mobile-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 kroner.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for the common headphones.
The best and technically most equipped mobile phones and even with a 3.5 mm socket for common headsets, cost up to 15,000 SEK.
Instead, the advantage of the readers is, among others, easy handling.
The simplest ones are not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) we really do it by anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the rotary disc, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally hitting the start of the mobile internet network and consequently a giant bill for data transmission.
What device to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Also when it comes to the purchase of the respective card, you are included in the 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones do it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you must not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, you prefer to take specialized phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual MP3 keys and the convenience of service so you get closer to the same MP3 player.
In this regard, Sony Ericsson has made way more, which walkman line phones have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands provide you with the same service and the same price category up to 4,000 SEK, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery strength (commonly 15 hours, up to 35 hours in line).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic by this year.
Possibly
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer almost all the services as their partners in Western Europe.
Here, however, something is missing – a virtual operator that obliges the traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be long.
From the fact that Czech operators belong to the most dear ones in Europe we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
After all, it was also confirmed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, who noted that the price of SMS is higher by us than in the rest of the Union.
Following the European Commission’s last steps in the field of roaming tariffs, perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created – for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in relation to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacks the competition that would really want to start the fight.
Perhaps it sounds absurd, here too we have three mobile networks and coverage high above 100%.
On the other hand, mobile phone operators like to be lazy about the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (<0xC4><0x8C>TU) , Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, has often stressed in the past that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with his own network probably no longer has many possibilities. (Otherwise, it might be difficult to find other frequencies now).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the market that led to a significant price drop, to which traditional operators would then have to react.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, there were similar voices in Britain like us.
However, it has been proven that the place for such operators is there and that they can really succeed.
After all, we must not go too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator has managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group to which in the Czech Republic belongs, among other things, U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to be able to actually operate, there are far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not carry behind, that is, relatively high expenses for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world, virtual operators usually come in low-cost, offer low-cost calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the offer of more restricted services.
Thus, for example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS that cost at least half as compared to its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows can be a pretty good move even betting on a target group not just recently.
This operator aims to say so specifically about men.
“Real men choose the Mobilking operator they like and can be trusted,” says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can assert a similar concept as in Poland.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> doubts this: “The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of services is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no possibility, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is ever a operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not have much expectations.
The ignition of Mobilking will take place rather in the other countries of our area," said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, a spokeswoman for Penta Financial Group, in a telephone conversation with Mobile.cz.
Thus, it has indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are certainly not very favourable to this view.
Rather, they try to do everything because you do not create any competitor potential.
For some time now, the GTS Novera Group has not hidden its interest in launching a virtual operator, which would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And first it's better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile network operators.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them," said Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe there will be better times.
Non-official information reveals that the first virtual operator will probably have it by the end of the year.
For now, however, around its creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At this point, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subjects with a complex and serious project have addressed us," said Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of Telefónica O2 press section in his statement to Mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is also used by other operators.
T-Mobil press spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "So far we have not noticed any vital and advantageous commercial project for both of us, on which it is possible to continue to build."
He added: “On the T-Mobil network, it will hardly be a virtual operator by the end of the year.
At this point we should have already had a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on achieving its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: “We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the point of view of our customers, the most productive.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common fast mobile internet network.”
Competent authorities -with complicit operators
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thereby to a decrease in profit.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The disturbances surrounding the creation of U:fon testify that when operators hold on to something they know how to tie on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure was pressuring <0xC4><0x8C>TU in the time of the creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by public access information from <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>’s web pages.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for which you do not accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented: “The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has recently been enhanced above all with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would result in him and, above all, his high-demand services."
However, the total disinterest of the Czech regulatory bodies is surprising from the attitude of mobile operators.
It is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, has taken its typical position on the whole issue.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after the conclusion of the lease agreement for the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers was probably not interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristián Chalupa, of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS External Relations Section, in response to our questionnaire.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators may not be surprising.
Instead, the office, which must defend the interests of consumers and, moreover, take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, is more than a delicate deal.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: “In the country where virtual operators commonly operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lowering prices for mobile services.”
But, of course, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Really shocking in the whole situation is the almost thrilling harmony of these three actors resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it’s really just a coincidence, comes on its own.
Just as the same price of gasoline for all petrols is without a doubt the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section has not found any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so there is no corresponding greater responsibility for its market behavior.
The neccessary tools for opening the mobile network market for virtual operators may also lack the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
There is, of course, the analysis of the relevant markets drawn up by <0xC4><0x8C>TU, according to which telecommunications are the single market from the point of view of economic competition.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer a different approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always necessarial the agreement of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has – in the end, logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not admit this argument, for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS it should be a little alarming that three mobile operators behave so strangely similarly.
At the same time, complaints from stakeholders (including the aforementioned GTS Novera company) show that during negotiations with all operators encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS keeps you out of the business.
This has already been found in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of <0xC4><0x8C>TU's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved update of the Telecommunications Act, despite the fact that, from this, many experts were expected to improve the situation.
<0xC3><0x9A>OHS representatives should know this more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
It can be done, when no one is looking
While we do not realize it, the operation of such pseudo-virtual operators remains, of which there are even some in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their price lists of mobile phone services, but are only partially public.
These are usually companies that deal with multi-level marketing.
Thus, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile phone services.
Price lists of these companies usually only reach the predetermined people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company towards the operator appears as a classic corporate client, who orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a pre-sale.
“If you present the cases you are talking about, which we will be interested in, it could be a violation of the terms of the contract, and it could result in the conclusion of cooperation with such a company,” Martina Kemrová answered the question in question.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 mentioned companies you can deal with thousands of customers.
No operator defends itself at the same time from such an attitude.
From the activity of these companies they draw a non-indifferent profit and at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they are not harmed in any way by their official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns of possible problems: “The law permits similar speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that the SIM card on their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot have it in full as the usual customers of mobile operators.”
But that should be a little strange to the <0xC4><0x8C>TU.
In addition, another question opens up for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has strong enough rights to uncover similar activities and if it does not, you will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and that their trading conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be more expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a considerable reduction in prices for services.
At the same time in virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The topics they used were virtually identical - too small market, too saturated limit, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in developed countries precisely in these cases the regulatory bodies intervened to defend not the mobile operators but their customers.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then came to the creation of the first virtual operator and others came to him.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies launch the whole case from one to the other like a boiling potato.
In our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But let's not throw the sponge.
If the backstage information is correct and the virtual operator will appear really soon from us, the Czech mobile market will get back on track.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, <0xC3><0x9A>OHS could hardly remain impenetrable to the rejection (discrimination) of other parties.
And we may stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j".
The new recording of the hymn was made by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available – only with male or female voice, choir step and instrumental edition.
The song is directed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the hymn are Otakar Jeremias and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already before he told the radio "<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
“From the beginning I tried to make sure that both and the choir had the clear saying, that the text was understandable, that they were in harmony,” he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j" was first played in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh theatre in the original Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka opera by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroupa.
He has acquired popularity and people have spontaneously made it his own.
The first strophe of the song after the founding of the Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
MHD in Prague will accompany you for the first time with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the metro, tram and bus will be the first passengers who will have an electronic card in their pocket instead of the paper ticket.
At the moment, it can be procured by about one hundred thousand people who own their own Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the 30- and 90-day annual ticket (which will start on January 1, 2009) and at the same time have their card recharged at the Infopoints and at the offices of the Transport Company and at the metro station Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Ka<0xC5><0x9B>nyska, Kobyny.
The cutiandi can be purchased from yesterday on the internet at the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who are going to start using the internet service can completely forget the stalls at the metro stops where so far they had to make long files for paper tickets.
The cut is purchased online and on the Opencard it is reloaded on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places passengers have at their disposal a gym with trained staff that will help those interested in online shopping and will also register on their card the credit acquired," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the libraries, it will be possible to load electronic clippers on the Opencards in ATMs and self-services that are installed at the entrances of the subway.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, they resemble the obliterators of the tickets and the passengers have already noticed them at the metro stops Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“There are now five in the whole city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty,” Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> concluded.
The cut will be checked instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Simply insert the Opencard card and after payment of the cut, it will load on top.
E-cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from number 300 to 499, that the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
“In the trains added to the integrated transport of Prague there are controllers equipped with card readers with which they verify the time and zone validity,” explained the Filip ticket control mode from the organization Ropid, which sets out the schedules for the collective transport in Prague.
Urban buses have card readers integrated into the driver’s box.
During the climb it is therefore necessarily not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at the specified point next to the box.
Thus, the driver checks the validity of the loaded cutters.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the loaded cutters, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this kind of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take the urban buses and will not remember, when the cutting expires, can again go to the ATMs, where the cutters are loaded on the paper.
Here you will see information about the validity of their documents on the device screen.
The Germans of the Sudeten wanted a US referendum.
The Germans of the Sudeten in 1945 asked to include <0xC5><0xA0>umava in the United States.
This is the result of the letter deposited in the scientific library of southern Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, according to what is said, some groups of German Sudetens turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is mainly due to the letter stored in a private archive and deposited in the scientific library of southern Bohemia.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov in the letter call on the US president not to allow again the restitution of the "district of <0xC5><0xA0>umava" – occupied by Hitler under the Munich agreement – to Czechoslovakia.
“We understand the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that American units come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads, “The people who hold the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava with all their heart.”
Since, they say, the annexation of Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans of the Sudeti hope only to the brutality, the lack of consideration, the misunderstanding, the oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter pray that the American president should always take over <0xC5><0xA0>matotto now.
“We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would recognize this territory as a state that is foreign to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has contributed for nothing, for nothing, to the Allied victory,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the thirst for revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States had doubts about the belief of the Germans in <0xC5><0xA0>umava, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the district on the will of its residents to become part of the United States or live under the rule of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the expectations of the then Germans of the Sudetens.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least intuit that it would be their displacement from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten peoples.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the prison camp in Hol<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n, dozens of other Czech Germans went to meet him for him to teach him Czech.
“They thought that once they came home the Czech would make them comfortable,” said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia on the brink of war, believed that on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees they would be displaced from the Republic.
Don't think you'll pay!
The Emotional Campaign Will Attack Drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could also be defined as the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to start on Wednesday.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s office is expected to discourage drivers from dangerous driving behavior.
The 150-million-dollar campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on the flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And also remind him to put on his belt before leaving.
He wants to touch young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers in his conscience.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially the stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't think you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is spelled mayonnaise on the sign.
And in a pot of blood there is the word "you will pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his or her life.
The spots will "spawn" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with drastic scenes of the victims of accidents.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Wheelchair and stick to drivers
"With drivers the carrot and stick system works.
The carrot for them is, for example, when they pass the red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of a fine or accident.
It is necessary to remind drivers of the risk," says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án of the Ministry of Transportation of Na Homolce Hospital.
And that’s why it takes information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels that warn drivers of danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel that warns of danger has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and drivers will no longer pay attention to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án warns.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed his support for the restitution of virtually all occupied territories in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published on Monday, the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all (occupied) areas, if not all, will have to be returned," Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will have a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to leave the same percentage to the Palestinians (of the Israeli areas), because without it there will be no peace,” he added.
He has admitted that the eventual return will also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the spears or spears to pass over him, as one of my best friends has done, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in a statement to the two July attacks in the city, during which some of us were killed and some of us were killed.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which are inside the Old City.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he also stressed.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed his support for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was a necessary condition for concluding this peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan," he said.
“The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they will have to renounce the permanent support, which they offer to Hamas terrorism, (the Shiite movement) of Al-Qaeda (the precise prime ministerial network) and Jihad (the terrorist network).
Post-Incident Questions: Are Stewards Illegal in Buses?
The law doesn’t recognize them, you can’t walk on the bus that takes long distances
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padova of the bus company Student Agency came out the question whether the stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the race.
“If we want to comply with the laws strictly and formally, the steward’s activity is in conflict with the road traffic law,” said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident last week that killed a 22-year-old hostess was caused by a truck that cut the road to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the less secure seat of the bus, despite the fact that there were two more seats allocated.
But the bus can make an accident or slow down abruptly even when distributing coffee or newspapers.
Depends on whether or not the bus is equipped with standing seats according to the circulation booklet.
If it is not approved, passengers must be seated.
The Student Agency buses have no standing seats, the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura confirmed on the website Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“We assessed this with the Ministry and at the beginning it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
It was subsequently revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned seat,” he said.
The law does not recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward - no law deals with the regularization of this role."
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from performing the services.
The Road Traffic Act only recognizes the vehicle’s accompanying term, its rights and duties are not defined,” said Hanzelka.
The Director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, on the other hand, believes that the law is sufficiently concerned with this issue.
Depends on whether the bus has approved standing seats.
It's all here," he says.
It categorizes buses in urban areas where there are standing seats and maximum speed limited, interurban with standing seats with maximum speed higher and long-distance standing seats with maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert.
BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín does not find the underlying problem in the movement of the stewards on board the bus.
“During a quiet race there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on airplanes.
It’s not even safe there when a turbulence comes and the flight attendant can blow his head.”
"If the bus does a sudden braking, of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like in urban buses or trams.
The carrier company must solve the security of the stewards with an internal regulation," he says and also means that, from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of the stewards.
This takes about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director considers their profession dangerous.
“As soon as I have the feeling of having to consider the steward’s profession as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they sail.
Expenditure would also be reduced,” he says.
Director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of the lines compared to the Student Agency, has motivated the absence of stewards on his means as an interest in security.
"We don't have hostesses, we've been opposed since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end up in a deadly accident," T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz said less than a year ago.
There was an immense tragedy.
In the Naples line accident, a young hostess from the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region died, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid it with a sudden maneuver, but hit him with the right front.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the stewarts were occupied.
"It is not possible to book these seats in long-distance buses, they are inexpensive."
The company has in mind to report the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the court’s ruling to pay the damages to the girl’s family, but it expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The revision of the law?
Not in view
The revision of the law, which has been working on by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport for more than a year, could lead to clarifying the movement of stewarts on board buses.
"But they have not achieved any concrete results.
They are not considered so much by buses, they are more concerned with the score system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones while driving,” says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transportation does not consider the activities of the stewarts as a major threat to the safety of passengers," said Havelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, who said that the control of the safety of buses is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
Düsseldorf’s hopes focus on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from the director of the WestLB addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published on Monday, it could form "the center of the capital market of the savings banking group" through the unit meeting of the Düsseldorf banking institution with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
The West LB would launch a "competent block" with lasting profits in such a company.
In addition, all of this union could be a decisive push for further ties in the banking sector of the Länder.
This is how it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate its ability to act.
Because the WestLB afflict is still under strong pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Authority, having recently noted to the North Rhine-Westphalia regional government that time is tightening to find a future solution.
The ties between the Deka-Bank, which the same customers of the Savings Boxes already know because of their investment funds, and the WestLB has certainly been talking about for a long time, even by Frankfurt.
At the end of August, Deka-Bank head Franz Waas reported on the presentation of the first half of the year’s turnover that a merger of the house at via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB made no sense.
However, the Deka’s board of directors, which is halfway through regional banks and savings bank consortia, delegates the board of directors to talk with the West LB on joint negotiations.
This could be market negotiations or parts of them.
The conversations, however, have, as they say in the business square, just begun.
Dela Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the most important in the business square in Frankfurt, not to mention the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings box sector.
In 2003 it seemed for a short period that the Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhine-Palatinate and Helaba.
Nothing has been done about this association of three.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank of Asia was opposed to the participation of Helaba.
The other two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of Rhine-Palatinate went to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they have always thought about a merger of the Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end Günther Merl, chairman of the board of directors of Helaba, expressed himself against design games to reunite with his home.
Apart from that, it seems that cognition is created, that it is necessary to approach the different houses of the public sector.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Württemberg could first take place.
For Helaba, this is not good news at all.
If the pressure for other mergers increases, the partners will be missing.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although so far he has overcome the financial crisis much better than the homes in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Assia-Turkey savings association, which participates with 85 percent of the Helaba, has put the chain to the meeting with the WestLB.
Only the NordLB will remain.
These geo-strategic reasonings are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual homes are combined.
In June, Merl noted that the German savings bank association had not yet given a response to the decisive demand, with which business model the future of regional banks would be secured.
Eventually, the division of the West LB could also come out, which by that of course is not desired.
Thus the letter of the board of directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the reunification of the individual parties with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or fourth time.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so says everything is different.
Behind them the 5l barrel of the Kaiser brand stands a massive beard and demonstrates to about 200 travelers what the deep tones he manages to produce from his throat.
Elena gave Luca a bite first and then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the parking of the buses next to Porta Nuova station, four couriers depart this evening at 23.45 with the destination Monaco, Festa della Beer" , arriving scheduled at 6.30 p.m.
Three couriers are reserved mainly for Italians, in another they travel only Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It’s so noisy, says Marco, that it’s not something for Italians.
Marco who wears a long coat with false fur lining and a pair of glasses with wide silver stitches belong to him buses.
For 5 years they go to the Oktoberfest, this year there are 3 tours.
The night walk, the day at the party, back at 22.30.
Overnighting would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 includes the trip, the welcome toast with Kaiser beer, made according to Bavarian authenticity standards, the disease checkout and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave at Brennero.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls on the bus, the passengers sleep.
Better yet, they will still need their strength.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian signage on the A9 highway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco’s group arrives at 6:30 at the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco: "Conoscersiviagiando.it".
Second: “When the doors of the beer tent open, it means running!” says Marco in the early morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow berries sitting on the same benches, split into the tight space!"
The mouthpiece costs <0x24>8.25, Marco cries.
And don't forget to feed.
"Proof to the security service that we're doing well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third: "Tonight at 10:30 p.m., we'll meet again here!
He's already leaving for the party.
On the way one attacks the yellow berries on the trees, on the street signs and even on an advertising poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the withdrawal.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as the "weekend of the Italians".
Exact data do not exist, it is said that 50,000, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The Munich police is reinforced with 7 South Tyrol agents, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistic on nationalities, where Italians are in the first place with 200 medical treatments in front of the English (about 60 medical treatments) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the Hofbräuhaus tent.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said last week.
It is good that the politician has used the word "relative" and has also pointed out that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started over the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, gets a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday that support loans would reach up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate must only pay interest for the requested part.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
At the end are the losses of the affiliate Deffa.
The state lender, according to a newspaper article, refinanced itself in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserves had decreased by 95% to 2.37 million euros, and the share of equity fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to 0 compared to last year, the profits from increases in both demand and certain shares as well as the liquidation of loans were down by more than 70% from 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher incomes from the reimbursement of subordinate compensation costs that come from both the restructuring of the former Deffa Group and the reimbursement of interest according to the single text of the tax laws and the management of business for business consortiums, the negative profit was fairly low16%.
The former public funder after being privatized in 1990 had lost himself in speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were incorporated into the Aareal Bank.
Since the income in the classic state funding was too low, Defa has been more engaged in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private and state investors (PPPs) and has diversified internationally.
The Hipo Real Estate must now amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group’s profit and loss account.
The fact is that dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007, it had been reduced by 2/3.
Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of Defa is a major state and infrastructure funder.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market between banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, loans between banks largely dried up because banks accumulated liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually requires a portion of Depfa’s credit portfolio – about 50 billion – short-term refinancing funds.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financial needs have been covered by credit for a certain period and the company is protected from the influence of the international monetary markets mostly not functioning.
From other sources it is heard that thanks to the money, refinancing is ensured until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the board of directors of HRE, Georg Funke, on the contrary, said that the HRE group will not need monetary markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) rely on the fact that the HRE Group is still commercially viable.
This is expected for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamics and impedance of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
It is possible that the funding will not be fully used.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After Sunday night the bank learned that she was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the spirits.
The stock price falls by 75% on 3.30 Euros.
The courses of the loans are quite well.
While front-degree debts appear almost immobile, they give up the deferred credit rates.
Above all, Württemberg-Hypo’s mortgages are affected, including depreciations with maturity beyond 2009.
The HRE loans used to appear to be a speculative alternative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the bank and institution crisis itself, which, with the help of the Defafa crisis, must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Until central banks, governments and less damaged banks are still ready, you can count on an annual depreciation within the deadline.
Or it goes into effect, what no one dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But concerning the information reversed due to partial stateizations the almost certain probability has become a justifiable hope.
It will primarily create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision to split up from their commitments.
Short-term investors can conclude the reporting of losses for future payments of the compensation tax on surpluses.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to show up at Tachibana Highschool on the first day of school, the girls start to laugh: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does it mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-in the new Japanese exchange log.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I also had a good time going to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the road alone and fortunately I didn’t miss it.
The beginning of the first lesson does not seem to have been fixed as we have in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive slowly from 8 a.m. until 8.40 p.m. begins a brief interview with the professor, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who talks in front of people, in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn’t have my school uniform yet, I put on an old jacket from my host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I sat in front of the chair and tried to say well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, raised, and made a sign, and then I heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew this from my mangas.
It belongs to the Japanese girls' essential lexicon for survival and means "carino, sweet".
Then I ran quickly to my place.
The girl next to me whispered, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the lesson was continued quietly, but when she played gong, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
They were all talking disorganized and smiling and drying me up with questions – then it’s really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone opened their blessing.
My host mother also made me the lunch basket- it is different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and a kind of envelopes with meat and tofu..
To be honest, I don’t even know what I’m eating in Japan.
Things look strange and have a completely new taste.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under salt, brrr!
The Bento are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl gives a gift made by herself, prepared artistically enough, in the hope of meeting the boy during the recreation.
I read it in my manga comics.
I'm really curious if I can find out.
"Why exactly Japan?" my friends asked me when I told him that I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I've always said,
"Because I'm fascinated"
I’ve been reading Mangas for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started learning a little Japanese.
I was completely convinced to come here once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and costumes.
They hold us a lot here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and the latest trends - on the other hand: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
1. Also rats have feelings
A rat or a cockroach run away when they feel the danger. Meaning, they also feel the fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could it happen if, when they behave in our own way, they have our own feelings?
For several years, articles from well-known scientists have been published in the Internet journal "Edge".
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents chosen answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to try it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without which I or anyone else has been able to prove it so far, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case, we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or consciousness in general, we enter an impracticable territory, because the base of reference does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same thing as other animals. That is, it pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to convey our feelings towards animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often connected to the human consciousness, the associated circuits (this is due to its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this wide area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the foundation is thus admitted on the assumption that man differs even from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should appear in the way man speaks: since a large part of life is connected to language, it is often said to be connected to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although consciousness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the animal consciousness, as it is made, certainly differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through your own experience due to the special hardware, their research will bring us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of the conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which science would be easier to access.
Animal consciousness processes could be analyzed without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies on the short memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, one goes first to the neural connections of consciousness rather than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of the display.
So, what do you think about feelings?
I charge them with the fact that an emotional system like fear is activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the body’s reactions) occupies working memory.
In this way, the feelings are closely related to the regions of the cortex, which characterize primates and especially the human being.
With speaking nature we create subtle nuances of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Regarding this, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings result from more primitive activities than the regions of the body of the sensations of the cortex and the head palate, similar to Jack Pankseep, who has nevertheless focused more on the palaeocephalus.
Since this network during human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the extended feelings of the species.
On a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I think it is unmistakable.
Pankseep argues that what for rats and human beings appears as fear, is likely to occur with the senses in both cases: but how could it happen, if rats and human beings experience the same thing when they behave similarly?
A cockroach in case of danger escapes as if he too felt the fear?
In my eyes, the simple similarity of behavior cannot yet demonstrate any vital similarity.
And that is, the neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and humans have similar palaeoencephals, cockroaches don't even have a brain.
But is the palaeoencephal responsible for feelings?
And even when it could be proven to humans, how would you like to prove it on rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to have to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there are progresses at the neural level, as long as you give up the same procedure on rats and men.
Just as I don’t do research on language and consciousness in rats, so I don’t do it on their emotions, I don’t even know if they exist.
This may be considered myope, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than constantly hitting a wall.
I'm an emotionally practical one.
UEFA President Platini: postponement for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europeans with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
Both host countries are listed in the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stadiums to be used by Europeans will even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't lose any more time.
Now we have to work at the maximum speed,” said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigori Surkis.
"The Uefa will keep an eye on us all the time."
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be “the serious danger that the PZPN would not be able to operate according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter, we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer."
Numerous members of the first division were convicted of manipulation only last season, in the end the start of the League had to be postponed at the last moment.
Dennis Quaid is angry
He wanted to promote a new film, in an interview he talked about the private and now he has a great deal with the former: Hollywood star Meg Ryan declared his former Dennis Quaid adultery.
He foams anger and retreats.
War of the Roses is delayed for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors are now fighting each other a ugly fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week first expressed her reasons for the marriage’s failure: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and this has been very painful.”
The extent of the betrayal she would have come to know only after the separation.
The occasion for the "soul breakout" was the work with Ryan's press for her new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adulterous man.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his publicly declared adulterous husband was clear: it would be “unheard of,” he told The New York Daily News, which “Meg for the next time repeats and reworks the story of our relationship.”
It would also be "deplorable" that Jack, the sixteen-year-old son they had together, once again "were publicly reminded of the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from the separation lives alone, Quaid is again married and will soon become the father of twins.
And so his judgments close with the arrow: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself fortunate to have a wonderful family where everything goes for the best.”
Prices for airline tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and hotel overnights have become more affordable again - this is the result of a study by the financial and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of the year 2008 and after a price increase in the first quarter it saw a clear drop in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities still surveyed rose by an average of around 6.9 compared to 2007.
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
American Express sees this as the reason for the weak dollar quote, which would lead to a "heavy desire to travel American tourists"
Financial centers such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession of hotel prices more strongly than industrial centers such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold a record in Europe
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend in the first quarter is still on:
Due to the burden of kerosene, passengers in the Economy Class had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, long-haul fuel intensive flights would even be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, prices for Economy Class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, however, in the first class and in Business price changes were much weaker.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more strongly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 per cent, falling by 23.6 per cent in the second quarter.
As for domestic German flights according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the price drop would be, on the one hand, economic growth downwards, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has deteriorated.
On the other hand, it would be because of the open skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe, an increased pressure on competition.
A sign of the critical situation would be the abolition of non-profit routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that would have declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV beat Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes a capillary.
At Borussia Luhukay we still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the landing of luck for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player first came into play late and failed with a shot at the crossing
His message was formulated with precision, passing it on his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hallway of the Hamburg Arena.
It hadn’t happened much since in the catacombs, the game break was over and most of them were sitting in their place again.
Rieger has been a HSV physiotherapist for almost 3 decades, enjoying an even greater appreciation of certain old players.
And so his warning also found listening in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol stepped up and raised his thumb as a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His order must have played in a similar way: here is the second goal!
The change of position has not occurred.
“Today, not everything was nice to see here,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have “wanted to be more relaxed.”
For 1 to zero, Hamburgers should thank Mladen Petric (11) for the headshot and the fact that many weak players at Gladbach were unable to hurt the weak players at Hamburg.
“It was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol summarized.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
The spectators already celebrated on Saturday afternoon, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which legitimized their sporting society as before the class.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We are able to put everything in place," said Marcell Jansen.
It has the impression, that the provisional certificate from the table is more indicative of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its newly engaged late arrivals – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen blown away at FC Bayern – slowly finds itself, but has not yet managed to shine.
“We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling,” Jol says.
After the loss of the vote
In Wall Street there is fear.

Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses space probe has flown through space for almost 18 years.
Due to the fuel pipes that freeze quickly, she is now responsible for the death from freezing.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion – the Swing-by abnormality
Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum/spinning/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical record as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What scientists have been wondering for years is that rockets do not behave at all as would be expected under the law of gravity.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes as before Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain the anomaly of Swing-by through the so-called dark matter that astronomers have spotted in the cosmos.
“The responsible for the anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Space scientists have only been aware of the existence of dark matter for about 10 years.
A force of attraction evidently emerges from her, the effect of which on the other celestial bodies can be seen.
Instead, it is completely invisible, that is, it does not send or reflect any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists, dark matter constitutes at least one-fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting prior to the release, six kidnappers were killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The rescue negotiations are already underway.
The Germans are always on the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists abducted in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the chronicle of the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are examining their health status,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 members of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting that took place before the release of the hostages remains unclear: so the kidnappers, following the instructions of an Egyptian public security officer, would be ready for the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed six of them by surprise.
"The problem had been solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the official said.
It would have been "only tried to take over the hostages," when suddenly came "this surprise".
Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday killed six of the kidnappers and captured two of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million from Germany; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary that the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women in hostage after the ransom was paid.
The men should have been detained as long as the kidnappers had no safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
The abuse of the father-in-law "caused suicide"
Years of abuse by the father-in-law have led a woman to commit suicide, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, has been in prison for six years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
The Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly harassed his daughter Stephanie Randle when she was between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a note of the confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise harassed her and bandaged her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to Cornwall.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Public Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Mrs. Randle’s friends, who had been a great surfer and cyclist, were “emotionally dead,” and that she had “moved with life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is thought that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle consoled his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter ending: "I tied her up and kissed her."
“I didn’t sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "She is an extremely strange fetishist, and for her victim she must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven.
“This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking her life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn’t done it, it would have been difficult for the facts to end up in court.”
I know the effects that Stephanie’s father and mother have had on their daughter in these years.
“Otherwise it was clearly likely that she was a promising and happy young woman of success.”
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Office Office officer who left top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC reported.
The man was on his way from the Department of Defense when he left on the train for Waterloo two highly classified documents.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the charges made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
“They would have thought that this was being treated internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, will be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause concerning the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be charged by the metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The lost documents contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the B&B account
British construction companies could face an account of over <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has donated <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all companies taking the money from the savingsmen, including the 59 construction companies.
The CEO of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it was “irritating” that companies and their members had to pay.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley’s loans are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid annually to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It's annoying that those institutions that have behaved prudently... are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the construction company association, told the BBC that he thinks it’s unfair.
“It’s annoying that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the home recovery market are now called upon to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less prudent.”
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
“We have to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options are there to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account,” Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk salts at 5 penny per liter
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of its milk for an extra five penny per liter from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves if they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the increase in February, wholesale prices last changed in 2002.
Bangladesh's former Prime Minister denies bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to give her a bail for extorting 50 million takas (<0x24>729,700) to a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of the many corruption allegations we have filed against her.
Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, had been released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is planned for the coming weeks but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's temporary government backed by the military give the first day total freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical care on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of her release, whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
“The high court rejected the bail application for Sheikh Hasina by arguing that she cannot have the bail since she is already abroad on the word for medical care,” said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs the bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December election.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, a senior Awami League leader said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-backed government took power, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical care.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear of Afghan anti-polio campaigns
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing in the recent vaccination campaign due to violence related to the Taliban, the UN says.
The UN launched a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
But it is said that it cannot reach children in Helmand and Kandahar parts in the south for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said this happened despite Taliban promises that they would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying the vaccines.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its participation in rival ITV television station.
BSkyB was told by the competition appeals court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had said that the participation of BSkyB hindered competition and allowed unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the share in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB’s stake in ITV raised doubts about ITV’s independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The head of the Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer groups and the regulator of Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy -- particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special public prosecutor to examine the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The operation took place when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice critical of the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by fear that prosecutors would be removed for political reasons.
Special Public Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials questioned during the investigation have lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Series of accusations of potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or appraised," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special public ministry with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for failing performance.
But later it emerged that the fired lawyers had not been rated more lacking than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the fire was motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in lawsuits against high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud to the detriment of democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and bring cases to court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, the Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was in the storm for the dismissals, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials were fired.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility in the dismissals, that he had abdicated his role as leader and had been exceptionally detached during the trial.
Other officials, including former senior assistant Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigations.
The Epic of Meat Loaf Will Be Celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is due to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will retire his special gold award at next week’s ceremony in London, said he was “honored” to win the award.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of the 1977 hit album by Meat Loaf.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year's awards, being on the list of nominees in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was performed as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached 15th place.
But the Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell album went on record for nearly nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf – real name Marvin Lee Aday – has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
He later appeared to have a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon on sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other crossings, some famous, others purely of use.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and residents for a long time find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small road is in the East Village and goes north from the First Road – without taking the Second Road – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
Approximately 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active road.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlantic.
The road, however, must have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the newly built luxury buildings on the First Road.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include long-time neighbors who say they were hit by the blocked road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the gentleman’s neighborhood of the past.
But the city’s conservation and development department, which has control of the roads, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the municipal commission's land use committee some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, district director of Community Board 3.
"There is very little space left to the town property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There may be proposals to set it up and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wanted to reopen the small road and install seating, including some to use for a cafe where the real estate company hopes to lease the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay was buying the road was first made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this elite alleyway and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Housing Preservation, said it was the city’s desire to sell the road and noted that the agency’s purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its most colorful neighbour, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe it took its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the cover photo set of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia."
"The terrain was splendid," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of rubbish, buckets of clothes and pieces of boots, posters, leaves, strings."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about East Village’s “gentrification,” opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, adducing that the piece of public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of town for almost nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Little Nostalgic Look at the Extinction City"), published part of a Discourse on the History of the City that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is an awkward bustle without exit, also dark in the daytime and delimited doors of rusty iron warehouses and windows with saracines, with week-old newspapers rolling down the bottoms."
With a few exceptions, the road looked almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran agilously through the back of the road near a door leading inside the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls were graffiti and an empty 22-ounce bottle of beer lying next to a group of abandoned newspapers.
Few passers-by said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest that she would need to be a little embellished.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said that some people also think to underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty, and disgusting places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in English
Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of the candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior member in California studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs to choose a school."
Really attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that, “Afro-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama’s educational plan specifically supports, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English students.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in other languages than English, does not take into account his interest in filling the learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a primary school in the eastern county of Los Angeles.
Students at the school are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among the fourth students, an astonishing 100 percent of the students did the higher-level test in the 2008 mathematics state exam.
An equally astonishing 93 percent of the fourth grade students did the expert-level test on the art-of-the-linguistic-English.
This incredible result has been achieved using a different ingredient from that preferred by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes revision and exercise, constant assessment of skills and a "no excuses" attitude.
In addition, and it is here that Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's obstructive approach for English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “We’ve had a fantastic success with a student who just came from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you wouldn’t have been able to identify which one it was.”
"It works," he observed, "it works for us."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Hispanic-majority schools with English students?
The school’s achievements make the answer to that question very easy, but education policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own continued support for bilingual education prevents it from predicting Mr. Obama’s response.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the topic trivial when he said people should stop worrying about “English-only” legislation.
Instead, he said, "you have to be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these achievement gaps, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise or banalize them.
Oil slows down sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to boost the economy.
The crude futures fell 7 percent to <0x24>99.80 per barrel on the New York Stock Exchange in morning operations.
Prices have lost more than <0x24>20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, and by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of <0x24>145.26 per barrel in June, prices had fallen to almost <0x24>90 per barrel earlier this month, before rising again, against the backdrop of tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety struck investors again on Monday after congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement over the weekend about the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was obscured by the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from past.
In the final episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that the bustling weekend negotiations had led to a rescue deal “seem to have failed to revive the feeling of the market.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange markets has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape from contagion.
From a raw materials perspective, our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year while home oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, reducing forecasts for oil and gas prices by about 20 percent for 2009.
Exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
He then watched the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a rebound.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had equalized the greyness of the threatening clouds that overwhelmingly overwhelming them with a fickle game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a touchdown of 12 yards, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon where their growing harmony made a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the quarter, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds remaining at the end of the first time.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that came to Coles.
He's a fantastic player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people can think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing catch-up games, the defense heavily hit Cardinals' quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a slippery launch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith planned another passage and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens makes a Warner fumble.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, could have been the most notable.
The Cardinals took advantage of that possession of the ball, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had taken the ball back with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely scored a 20 yard goal, for an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, “The second quarter or the third quarter?”
When he was told both - the Jets conceded 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter much more than the third."
There have been a lot of points in a small amount of time."
Gebrselassie rested to break his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown again why many consider him the best marathoner of all time, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to race a 26.2-mile race in under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the favourably flat race at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie scored his previous score of 2:03:26 in 27 seconds, last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record for such a stunning career that it produced a world championship or a world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps in a way too alarming, in retrospect - that air pollution would exacerbate her asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect condition - sunny and 48 degrees at departure, 55 degrees at arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a sliding average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-founders like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya went to long distances, the marathon record has fallen more than two minutes in the past decades, since Ronaldo from the Brazilian Coast won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago she had cramps to her pelvis and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left it cool, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but in the end everything went well.”
He was somewhat criticized – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s East African rival – for over-orchestrated his races, generally avoiding many of the best marathon stars in the world, counting on the runway as if it were a midfield race, and putting the world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the size of Gebrselassie’s skills as a marathoner.
With the pace cadenced by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point at 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, competed in Gebrselassie after the runners-up disappeared.
Just over three miles from his arrival, Gebrselassie made a final effort to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of the UK holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She lost the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but she was cured to win in Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a big break, taking them back after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia came second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the extensive theme park on the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, the noise, the huge, lies the quiet city where pride and the complications of the African-American experience enter life.
Eatonville, the first all-black city incorporated into the country and Zora Neale Hurston's home, is no longer as simple as it described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
Now it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city that it has described – and that makes tourists stop by including it in the Florida tourist guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers’ Project – remains a separate place.
She is as independent, dignified and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted to share their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little of us, does not know what is being lost."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called for an opening speech on the race, many here remain suspicious of the outsider’s gaze.
“We are very careful about how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
"It must be fair."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also a shadowy example of the blacks’ rural culture of the south – sometimes disrespected, sometimes rewarded – born from American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through honest, dialect-rich books, such as Mules and Men (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida’s guide transformed the city just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida within a scenario of black history and human drama.
Low as a handkerchief in both life and literature, Hurston took the readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then turned to private areas.
"Outside the street to the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-maintained gardens and courtyards, to which Howard Miller always looked, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever suits the passage rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously this wasn't Fodor's.
It was not a portrait that everyone liked.
"Now she was saying it like it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls that Hurston immortalized citing men singing rough songs about their beauty.
He adds: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who often returned from his family moving to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston was raining in the city, he usually arrived in a Chevrolet triumphant without warning, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts of decent clothing today.
Many residents were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others sneered.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, she added, dondolandosis on her chair in the backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed for long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books had gone out of print.
Together with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a plaque-free grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorative ceremonies, and no major conferences.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his leave to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change took place in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-course highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-course main road.
Orlando’s expansion has already pushed La Interstate 4 across the western boundary of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle over racial confusion brought hatred to the community's home door.
“During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things at the people sitting on one side,” Franklin said.
"In fact, we had a girl who was killed by that one time.
They threw a coconut out of a car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, defining his Brown decision against the school office "an insult rather than an honor for my race."
Residents now say that school desegregation, despite having been positive in some respects, dilutes Eatonville’s cohesion and jeopardizes the confidence of its youth.
"Black kids were used to being hugged - I remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher...- I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who surpassed prejudices, as she did, with joy of self-confidence and lines like: "How can some deny to themselves the pleasure of my company!
I can't really understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker embarked on a long journey to the Hurston Tomb without a sign and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway's acclaimed biography of Hurston hit the shelves of libraries, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The project of the highway came just as his most famous daughter had retreated the beam lights.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a rescuer.
The community began designing a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many come back for commemoration.
Many years later, the state withdrew from its road project.
"The five tracks of the resurrected highway have brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts it in a simpler way: "Now he saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped change the city’s image of itself.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the Public Historical Register in 1998.
A new one-stop library (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a refurbished and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida abnormality: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to look for the history of Eatonville, for its significance, are often still treated with caution.
A permission requested in advance is required for most of the interviews, some things – such as the murals on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields – do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weak for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Houston festival expanded, a high level of citizen pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing her entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, neither better, nor worse and proud, creative, great worker, silly and confused as other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection what can be heard in Mr. Franklin’s 18-year-old grandson Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they just got in here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" Alondra Kenon said after Mass on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it’s really a nice city.”
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newspaper counters and the huge TV screens of Times Square, they wouldn’t notice being in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that glass offices, bee nests over their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers that monopolize New York live the worst “bad day in the office” every day since the collapse of 1929.
The factors shove metal trolleys for the through the walkways, transporting muffin plates for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken shirts hung on a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in a row for their morning bagel on the food trucks on the walkways, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 on a working day.
It didn’t seem like there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings booklet on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the case so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a tail of about twenty was already waiting in a row.
Not in front of the cashier’s store, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service store, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions for the large Macy warehouse and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are in front of me, I would have learned later from Starr, my "trust banker," were in line for my very own reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken the savings from the smaller banks from the places from which they do pedals, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family members.
In recent years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with <0x24>327 billion in assets, has been subjected to controlled administration, and while New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend on Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of <0x24>440 billion, which was a buyer looking for.
The employees and contractors who were in front of me, frightened for another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe harbor, the bank that is asking for more bailouts on Wall Street.
The common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and her exasperated CEO Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if she was complaining about a poor colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform storey, almost fifty years old of my condo, has changed theme compared to our normal conversation topic about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expenses.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim tombs are profaned while Austria turns to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left of the right-wing Austrian Liberty Party and Filip Dewinter of the right-wing Belgian party Vlaams Belang, are taking part in a demonstration to present the "City Against Islamization" organization in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signals like those street representatives of mosques with a red line passing in the middle.
The police blamed right-wing extremists for profanating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties have earned a lot in the national general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun Cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The culprits have sprayed Jewish symbols like the Star of David over some graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motives driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is somehow linked to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the profanation, which took place towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious relevance for Muslims.
Austria, meanwhile, has embarked on a journey of spiritual research following its turn to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took almost 30 percent of the votes, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with vehement anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against veils and burkas and also expressed his opposition to food that is perceived as linked to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, adding that they are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses made immediately after the elections, which established the far right as the nation’s strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was brought predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Traveling abroad is forbidden by Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamour rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, was banned from travelling to France and Spain by the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities that they were controlling him that they wanted to go to Spain by way of France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to Kent police last Thursday after it provided prosecutors with evidence of Glitter's previous arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the hearing at Ashford Preture in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A Court Service spokesman said: “On Thursday, September 25, at Ashford Prefecture, Kent police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the register of convicted sexual offences.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police a seven-day notice of his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may result in a five-year sentence.
Kent police said they did not want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter displacement in the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: "The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
“From our point of view, it’s easier to control someone who remains in the UK because we have the right complete systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
“Protection of the residents of Kent is the main concern of the Kent police and we work closely to monitor the behavior of convicted sexual offences registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls.
When Glitter arrived he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he was sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not pass it to passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to let him in and returned to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Prefecture, west of London, as Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to include him in the register of convicted sexual offences.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A Interior Ministry source said that interior secretary Jacqui Smith felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from travelling to France and Spain.
"Photographer the master away from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No shoes, no steering wheels, no clothes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in the private, in those moments far from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look, or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go to the scene.
German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots by singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser-known side of these masters.
With this lens, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, capturing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the schedule of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day increasing," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed “on the street” are “artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the audience.
To capture the personality of these greats you do not need to portray them in the scene,
Because their personality and character are internal.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco."
With a passion for the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to portray singers, guitarists or dancers using a dial-up camera.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and material, resemble classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's own conception of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is capable of surprise every day."
Not the dance, the singing or the playing itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, capable of conquering the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, being exhibited these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Famous Flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, appear in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a sort of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think portraits are the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or compare yourself with people, characters that sometimes you don’t even know or that only give you a few minutes to take the photo.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to concretize my ideas.”
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people", is set up at the gallery El Fotómata, at number 20 via de la Mata, parallel to via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a "wrestling"
It is set in places he still does not know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is at the forefront of a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived in the Congo for twenty years and crossed the Amazon.
He has always been the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature and has confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia that the project he is working on today is "a gamble" and that "everything indicates I shouldn't write it."
"If I had good sense, I wouldn't write it, but I'll do it the same way and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as predicted, the leading figure in the third edition of the word festival.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens’ book "Our mutual friend", has filled theater seats Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer has been in front of an audience to whom the time has flown when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great amounts of humour, has re-evoked as born in him the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and the "pleasure to read"
The Spanish-American novelist, recognizing that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa's "more of this," arguing that "there is no way" to measure and to know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemerical experience."
The weather hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of races
The celebration of the races that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the towers selected for the races had verified that the ground conditions on the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, has decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather has been sharpened against this festival, preventing two days out of three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second tower race.
The posters included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were supposed to face a bull from Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival was held regularly only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting three ears and being brought out in triumph, after roaming with taste and aesthetics.
On the same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two races with a greeting and an ear, granted more by the public than on account of the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pity.
With the second bull, after a tremendous mule, he gained the fists of much of the public.

Agents intimate the high to the two occupants of a van who, instead of stopping, run away.
Officers intimate the high to the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping went on the run.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
Agents, after prosecuting them, are able to arrest one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to a statement from the Basque government’s Department of the Interior.
The detainee is accused of drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The accident occurred when some road officials in Alava were conducting a transport check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armiñón.
They were inclined to stop a van for inspection when the driver, violating orders, accelerated abruptly and crossed the locking point.
The agents went on track until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the side of the road and its two occupants fled into a forested area.
The Ertzaintza agents then managed to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and took action once the truck was inspected, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish pans, which were located in the back of the vehicle, were subsequently placed under police custody for an in-depth investigation and weight detection.
In addition, since officials found that the registration was "duplicated" as it did not coincide with that reported in the van documentation, the detainee was also charged with the crime of falsification of public documents.
The Ertzaintza is continuing its investigations to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee A. A. J., 28, was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under Drug Effect
Actress Heather Locklear, Amanda from the popular series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the car park in Montecito, according to People magazine from a California street spokesman.
The witness specified that around 4:30 p.m., the Locklear "scratched the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with rough manoeuvres forward and backwards.
Shortly after, the witness, who at first sight, apparently, had not recognized the actress, saw that the Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and had left the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, partially blocking the road.
"She looked confused," and that's why the agents took her to a drug and alcohol center to test her.
According to a police spokesman, the actress has proven collaborative and the hypothesis of excessive alcohol has been discarded from the outset, although "according to what officials observed at first, we believe Locklear was under the effect of some drug."
The Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effect of some unspecified substance and was locked in the local prison around 7 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was re-established by a specialist clinic in Arizona after being recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Callazares urges the Andalusian federation of the IU to assume its responsibility in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the IU and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional training federation to make a decision on the case of the former advisor to the Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned the resignations last week.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to take on its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt against what has been advisor to the council so far.
However, the leader of the UI stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this kind of investigation to have the maximum transparency."
Similarly, he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public offices."
"Sangre de Mayo", Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós’ Episodios Nacionales, Jose Luis Garci re-proposes in Sangre de Mayo the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 million in budget.
With this film, the director has attempted to "illustrate the flow of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría leading a wide cast of performers.
Blood of Mayo, for more than two and a half hours, debuts this Friday in theaters, to become in the future a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this tour "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before filming a memorial film on "Empresa Nacional" based on the second centenary of the royalty of 2 May.
The 15 million budgets allocated entirely by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate scenes and costumes to portray a "a shy Spain that mistaked the choice of the leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge delay in our development.
However, the director regrets not having received funding similar to those of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than double that of Blood of Mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes foreseen from the scenography he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Rever to start, has influenced what is his usual work practice, setting up with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before he turns along with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's work is in the seventh, knowing that he's going to the movies."
Many of the performers, part of whom are part of the cast of Blood of Mayo, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar nominee - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominees to represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood - his Blood of Mayo, Siete mesas de billar français and, the last selected Los girasoles ciegos - should not be "represented in the cinematography" more.
From this film Garci is not expected to receive any awards.
“At first you think you’re working for the posters, then you realize that you’re only working for prosperity, and at some point you’re content to just shoot one more movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Sevillan essence of ballerina Tortola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer pays tribute to another dancer as well as to Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana, and at the age of three moved with the family to London.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dance.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, the caliber of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, which marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would love to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposes this character to me. It seemed incredible."
The dancer says: “We don’t want to tell her life, but to gather the spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested me some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested me a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangi.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing also falls into this aesthetic,” she explains.
The show features two exceptional contributions: Miguel Poveda, who will sing again in one of her shows, as she does in "La puerta abierta"; and Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what she had been a student.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has agreed to work in my work and I am very honoured to do so.”
The arrangement also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song by Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi by Morón; the percussion by El Pájaro, as well as the violin by Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who have been all playing the role of an artist who is always very accommodating.
In the work is also present in some form the life of this woman that takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since, as usual, she resided in London.
“I wanted to remind her, because I think she’s one of the women who has had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers it and considers her work as something of value,” Bayon said.
The show will begin today, at 20.30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
With the publication of the "Diario de un poeté nuevo casado" also closes the Triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Advisory to the Culture of the Junta of Andalusia.
Thus, the "Triennio di Zenobia e Juan Ramon" ends with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel house-museum and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz provincienta, with a variety of New York's, which was inaugurated in the past May and with the Intervernacea.
In addition, the Advisory to the Culture of the Andalusian Joint acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most valuable Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of those.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and throughout America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman has gone.
It cost him a lot to get an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
He also knew he was very ill.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what you experience goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better because of its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland died at a particularly dark time, out of fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem of the American people on the ground, desperately looking for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so virtuous and remain good people to admire, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, it embodied the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and advocate of lost and won causes, from the foundation for the fight against the drug created in honor of the firstborn dead of overdose to the creation of the domestic and organic food brand.
All gifts to a country that has cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without taking care of either nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, noted that a man has not died, it's over.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, an Oscar-winning director, said working with Newman was nothing less than the peak of his career.
The bad boy who arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, gambled to describe Paul Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“He has left a very high-level example for all of us,” says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who nowadays tries to live like Paul Newman: keeping in high regard the need for fairness and having a serious, remote private life on camera.
This is not always easy or possible in today’s media jungle.
However, some try and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful, although he certainly did not miss the opportunity not to be.
"Why am I going out to eat hamburger today, if I have a biscuit at home?" she jokes.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Among all the great roles he played, no one was as proud as a devoted husband, a loving father, a passionate grandfather and a passionate philanthropist," they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012 attempt, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've ever seen.
A lot of nonsense, which if subsequently were taken into account in the evaluation and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let’s go by order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense started with the withdrawal of the spine, which assumed it was going away earlier.
It didn’t seem like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, that’s to withdraw everything (including the chip to avoid codes during the race).
Instead, no.
You only had to go to get the back (first stupidity, go only for this) and (after the relative tail), surprise! they only had T-shirts of size 'S' (second stupidity, because I need a size XL).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they have decided to buy only small t-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are naughty compared to the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the bag.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race that expects more than 11,000 people.
So, as was predictable, the race began that we hadn’t even deposited the bag yet, although, once successful in the enterprise, the recovery turned out to be even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts of popular uprising and assault on the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the correct order ranking because of the chip that, I suppose not correctly recorded the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, it will certainly not get into my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Conference on Emerging Technologies, Microsoft presented a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi company (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft's mobile phone, a shuttle service).
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this “receptionist” is able to know how many people there are in a room, who they are – including remembering their position in the company – and to listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
It can also group people in conversation groups.
In the example video, the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks if she is there to visit someone and tells her she will be available to her soon.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers had essential functions and were less loaded with commercial garbage, they would have to be five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for “the least.”
All a discovery, if you take into account that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciated.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is losing more and more importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your stepmother.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
It takes your computer only to launch Explorer or Firefox – or Chrome – and daily we spend more time browsing the web than in a remote window environment.
What is the use of half of the operating system applications?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services so that they constitute a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, in fact, and I bring here a small example.
I took the photo posted in this post in one of Microsoft’s employees’ recreational venues in Redmond earlier this month.
On the beverage machine, a directory invites you to use your search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to conduct a web search.
Last week, by the way, was confirmed the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be marketed in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the mobile phone is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried it to the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio glowed in Edward Zwick’s ‘Diamante de Sangre’, as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola’s ‘The Father’ as well as being part of the typical uniform of the musculoskeletal gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the fortress with the notes that lifts the weights in the ambulant circus.
It is, in essence, a typical men's shirt, with a cotton interior, tidy and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, although the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" stands out compared to others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive flag and for the small Belgian flag (recognizable velvet), which the most emblematic models of the t-shirt carry as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" stands out compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive flag and for the small Belgian flag (recognisable hangover), which the most emblematic t-shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company is not just about the famous "tanks".
Includes college shirts, boxer retro, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, mariner t-shirts, baby dolls, mini shorts...
Underwear designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
“I want to be a young mother, the candidate doesn’t care.”
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new fashion business very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities that lend their own name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango firm made of its new headquarters, as well as the presentation of the most important awards sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Warm and timid, it quickly conquers you.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have designed for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Say, a very intense, but at the same time, exciting day.
What are the elements of your new collection for Mango in this fourth working season for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the '50s and '60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love to get lost in the city and watch women dress, combine and mix their clothes. I do it often.
Ballerina, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think yes, although in the end, everything converges and there are many elements in common.
When I was little, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to dine in my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to dressing.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to lessons and proverbs, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when they deliver you the wardrobe is the moment when you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you got into a crisis?
Oh, no.
I've never felt better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to enjoy life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I did the things I wanted when I was little and this gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So you think you're going to be a mother, or not?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because my own body asks for it and I also want to be a young mother, I don’t want to miss it.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the movies, you're waiting for them to come out in the different rooms a few movies shot last year.
That's right, and I really want them to come out.
Being a woman coming from the theater, I am very impatient and anxious, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it can’t always be that way.
I want "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the Tomb of Christ" to come out.
Let's see if you like it
A few days ago, you debuted on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not that I was in the walkway as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, who I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization "Women for a Better World" and the clothes we showed – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – were auctioned for this NGO.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
There is so much said about her that I who have known her for a long time can confirm that they are not so true.
Also, I find myself with this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to make the pine, I would have done the same.
If it is to help the women of the third world, you can't pull back.
Recurring drivers of alcoholism will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol levels to install in their car a system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of drunkness or if it is not blown into the device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the Attorney General, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The purpose of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since this will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the Attorney General for Road Safety, the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers reported more than once per drunk driving return to driving the car.
The alcohol lock would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from moving if the driver does not blow, or when an alcohol concentration is detected higher than the permissible.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be at the expense of the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices allow to reduce up to 65% of violations committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: stopping these behaviors before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since the legal reform can be carried out by ordinary means, and, undoubtedly, the reform necessary for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the PSOE in which it proposes to install this system in school buses, as it has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 17.40, according to the program, the Spanish plane in which the Asturias principles were travelling landed in the presidential hangar at the Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays were still forcing to use their hand as a viewer to see the royal pair descend from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver, on the street, if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you won't be able to go to the airport to load people at that time ... She's from here or...
- No, no sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who are the principles of Asturias and the importance of travel.
There are many who wait in the airport hangar crushed on the red carpet and the military cordon made up of 27 navy soldiers offering the honor greeting.
The prince looks smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the princess, windy, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps told her that in Mexico City was threatened by bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short stop before they pass the room where the official commission awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the city’s four largest, a spirited Mexican television reporter awaits them.
The best prize offered by fashion
Probably there is no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, which is not Paris and probably there is no more exquisite and bont vivan designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
Offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in the Mango showcase at number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried out of emotion.
By the way, it is the company’s second largest store in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first one is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who chaired the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity to Chagal’s most exquisite plates, Mango’s presidential gala table was even more spectacular.
Born, with a broken heart and making necessary virtue, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some ELAH accessories to take away the breath and the arm of his son Luis - a boy almost two meters high - he accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, made the honours of home and as a knight, which he finished, along with Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had given it to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the shop in pants and shirts – drawn by her hand – transformed herself for dinner, wearing a long, very sensual black dress and was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo.
Inés Sastre did not stop for a walk in the palace premises, but showed us the photos of her son on his cell phone first.
The next day we were delighted with the presence of Olivier Martinez – another boy moving on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and had previously assured himself that there was no smell in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and frenzied daily life.
And as if that wasn’t enough, they’re all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to libraries on September 30.
Waking up is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to imagine getting involved in the frenetic rhythm dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer is back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are not one or even two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the struggle to get rid of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, all a "menu" of customized options for everyone's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 Ways to Relax" and its calm will reach libraries thanks to publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone feels that it is not possible to gain calm in areas such as work or personal relationships, this “manual” denies that belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline doesn’t already flow into your veins to regain your body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who talk while staying asleep.
The first time it happens, at most you take a frightening, but in reality it doesn’t matter much.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquia.
It manifests itself with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, most of you have been told that you spoke in sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life, for example associated with a high fever episode) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the baby remembers nothing.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, night enuresis (being pissed), or sleep apnea, but it is not necessarily the case.
As already mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stress or overeating situations.
In any case, it is still a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or the opposite (scream, scream, long speeches...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and eventually consult a specialist to check if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as an outpouring of the situation.
We said that this is a benign alteration so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (e.g., if coupled with insomnia or stress).
What can be done, however, is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to exaggerate the baby before he goes to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that cause fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the sonniloqui appear try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not aware of what's going on, and you'll interrupt him to sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and then he's resting.
Remember that if it seems very distressed and episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check where such a great anxiety in the child comes from.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to question him for information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore unconscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not see what he is dreaming to say, so you need to pay a lot of attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which it could lead.
Never tell the child that you could ask him questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not even for a joke.
Something like this is causing a lot of anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s nothing serious, it’s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeussern... finally
The Illhaeussern finally found the way to victory at home after a long period of unsuccessful.
Without playing a fabulous game, the Yellow-Black have created the most chances from the net by turning one into the victory of the game.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this meeting in which the attackers expressed themselves at ease.
After a first attempt by the host team captain Kauffmann who scored the seven with a shot from a distance, the Illhaeussern began to get better and one by one they provoked the defense of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirn high, Romain from the top.
The Dannemarie responded with a blockage at the center of the field, leaving only the trigger Riahi at the point of attack.
The start of the second season was decisive with two initial occasions signed by Riahi and Temporale for the Dannemarie, and immediately after the first Marais net for the Illhaeussern, well-positioned, took a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illhaeussern gunman will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not bring great trouble to the Elfs of the Illhaeussern, just backwards to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last minutes of the game when, after a rocambolesca action, the ball kicked the cross.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a stopover in Britain.
Prior to the demonstration of fishermen who brutally blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided on Tuesday morning to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère department, to enchant its representatives.
The latter have promised to welcome him “with a constructive spirit” and hope that he will “present himself with concrete proposals”.
A presidential visit that takes place in conjunction with the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by the Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the price of gasoline, which has reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Eliseo spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and to secure working conditions and seafarers' wages."
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out "slump operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le have not been interrupted.
A road blockade has been implemented on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, sailors were already proving their determination by burning, starting at dawn, tyres and pallets in front of the fuel tanks at the ports of Brest and Lorient, as demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Manic Islands, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the fishing boats remained at the marina, or Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Loire-Atlantique, interrupted the blockade of the well-known Total refinery in Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held Wednesday at the ministry to decide any actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported the movement.
"The strike will continue" as "fishers will not give up" and "do not intend to move to Paris," for example, announced Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gasoline taxes, currently pay about 50 cents per liter, but estimate that the yield limit of a boat is only reached with a gasoline less than 0.30 euros per liter.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and still Sam Mendes have greeted film legend and engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
The aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries this year, despite the recession threats that affect the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth-largest company in the industry, maintains its delivery forecast for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
During the first semester, he delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, especially for aircraft of the range between 30 and 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would give up more than 15% of its assets
The insurance company American International Group, which is set up by U.S. monetary authorities, would hand over more than 15% of its assets in order to reimburse the <0x24>85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of much of its assets, in addition to the assignment of life insurance branches to the international market and to the United States, the paper is based on more than authoritative sources.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to consider any assignments, according to the FT.
The AIG has not received any confirmation.
The activities that AIG intends to cede include the air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
No final decision has been taken on such assignments, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly recover liquidity in order to reimburse the <0x24>85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve, at the expense of seeing U.S. authorities take possession of 80% of its capital.
Paris: Chronicles of the Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives expressed itself against Paulson's plan to rescue financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented drop, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) higher than that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchange following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the main technology securities index, lost 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55, from the final closing figures.
Demoralized at the start of the session, Wall Street is deepened after the unexpected rejection of the banks’ bailout plan, designed to bring back stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
Approximately two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
“It’s a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“All this indicates how much the market was counting on the project,” he added, fearing that it might be “too late” in a few days to adopt one.
“If the project were actually dying (...) then the witness would quickly be passed on to the Fed – Federal Reserve – and other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,” Brian Bethune, head of finance and economy at Global Inights, said in a statement.
And further highlighting the state of emergency, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, Pygza stressed.
After the failure of the Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities have arranged for the acquisition of the banking activities of Wachovia by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated abruptly, urging emergency intervention in favour of UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany banks, a sign that markets "are not only facing an American crisis, but a global crisis," FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of Treasury Bonds with a maturity of 10 years is 3.632%, compared to 3.827% on Friday evening, while the yield of Treasury Bonds with maturity of 30 years is 4.161%, compared to 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama in favor of first television duel
After Friday’s first debate between the two White House candidates, here’s a second to find out who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed the respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of American families.
Political scientist David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, though merited, was not brilliant enough to allow him to slow down the five-week polls from the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, of which a poll published Saturday gives Obama a five-point advantage (49% vs. 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat had the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them believed Obama to be the winner, while 25% bet on McCain.
An excellent performance by his listing partner Joe Biden, awaited during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, is expected to confirm Obama's advantage on Thursday.
“Underestimating it would be a mistake.
He has a good intention,” Clinton warned this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable foreign policy experience, emphasizing the opponent's "genuineness" with respect to the issues faced during the first-hand session.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that,” he said on multiple occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president," he said.
What has been a continuous target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without extending, it proved concise and precise.
He promoted his predisposition to the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
“McCain never understood, unlike Obama,” he tweeted this weekend, a democratic spot, accusing the Republican of not taking the necessary measures to cope with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a heavy rain, for an election meeting.
He has not even pronounced the words "middle class" or "workers". The financial crisis is in favor of Obama, considered by the Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the brink of the precipice.
“Next week could represent a decisive turnaround,” said influential Democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s intuition in economic matters to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse is “the final verdict after eight years of poor economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming the intention to cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street riots, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energies and the implementation of a health care system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
Cautiously, the two candidates squeezed questions focused on the <0x24>700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) bailout plan adopted by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you not notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to contest the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening following the closure of election seats in Minsk’s central square to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While the results were still awaiting, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some confess that they haven’t even voted, “Why? They’ll do as much as they want, by my vote,” says a boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made the foreign observers a good figure in the future in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of goods, could be lifted if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral committees and our observers have not been able to participate in the voting blanket," said Yuri Potemkine, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous 12-party alliance.
"This is a change of perspective," says Alexandre Milinkievich, former presidential candidate for the 2006 presidential elections and head of the pro-European movement, since the important thing is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If members of the opposition come to Parliament, it is because they have been nominated, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can involve a television space, regional meetings, and bills."
The opposition therefore has the duty to enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union needs to be initiated.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not provide for any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, recognizes the validity of the scrutiny.
He stressed that participation quotas seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) gave rise to any kind of manipulation.
"Have you not noticed that there were elections?" asks the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five opposition MPs in parliament, the most convenient in power."
The silence of the night falls on the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The Meeting - Blood Is Safe Again
Hema-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, as Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, seriously shocked by the blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
Faced with such tragedy and population protests, the Government of Canada conducted in February 1994 a public investigation, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the re-proposition of a similar disaster.
While Judge Krever was delayed in drawing up a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of designing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and la Société canadienne du sang for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its operations, only 38% of people said they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was deadly.
Thanks to continuous efforts to improve the safety of blood transfusions and field research over the next few years, we have regained public confidence,” she says, before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the population in Quebec now had confidence in Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases of the human variant of the mad cow in Europe, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, says the one that has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of its founding.
“And we didn’t know at all if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau relationships, according to which when you have doubts and you could get a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, you take excision measures.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was refused.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that undoubtedly this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This episode showed us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow to recognize the presence of the virus directly in the blood of donors and not antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, i.e. from the moment the person contracted the disease to the one where the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, the specialist explains.
That period could have been reduced to less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to identify them is so significantly reduced.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, this means you’ll need to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone gets infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years for a case of HIV to be diagnosed with a transfusion.
I believe that today you can feel at ease in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to restore health, says the head of the Hema-Québec management.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before stressing that, in addition to having secure resources, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient resources.
“Necessities are increasing as the population ages.
Being the most aggressive cancer treatments, patients often need a red blood cell or platelet intake.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the number of donors, which on average only constitutes 3% of Quebec’s population acceptable as donors.”
However, all healthy people who have reached the age of 18 and meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be rejected for a period equal to one year.
“With this 3% we manage to maintain an inventory capable of meeting the needs of hospitals.
Poverty cases are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they age and can no longer make donations.
Now it’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so frenetic that it’s hardly an hour to donate blood,” says desolated Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of <0x24>297 million, Héma-Québec distributes not only blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, cardiac valves, eyeballs, and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited at Héma-Québec, which operates the only public bank of ombilical cord blood in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, abundant blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the bank insertion of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
We should start proposing them for transplants at the beginning of next year,” says Dr. Décary, describing this practice of cord blood extraction as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that you can't have access," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the Semi-Finals
The Impact Montreal qualified for the semi-finals of the Serie A eliminations, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during a second decisive quarter-final match, at Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at 90'.
After a first time goalless from both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the following goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
We remember that on the first round game, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps of Vancouver in the semi-finals.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, Thunder filled a first 3-1 in the return game by winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semi-finals.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed in the day.
In short - Decisive Network of Kovalev
The Canadian and his asses are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostisyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostisyn, the star of the first encounter, scored a goal, made two passes, and collected a pass for victory, in the fourth of the Hab's preparatory games.
Decisive for the victory is the only network signed by Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet," he warned the Russians.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.”
"He tried to score in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the result of the game.
There was a nice ovation."
Charest tip to the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
Concluding the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to get himself elected on the occasion of today’s partial elections.
"Expanding the borders of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday in Levis, through tools with strong visual impact, on the occasion of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "Mine to Images".
On three max screens, they confused spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
It's as big as a full election campaign.
During the press conference, by the way, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the start of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very committed.
The “Plan Nord” is the fourth point of a “project” that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a “new economic space”, which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often nominated in the most recent speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the Northern Territory to the 49th parallel had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explain why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential", but did not comment on timelines or investment quotas, nor did he explain what the precise priorities would be in the realization of future projects.
Increasingly, it has been limited to highlighting what he considers to be a priority: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has undergone several improvements as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to Charest’s list, the North contains “nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds.”
That ‘large territory’ is twice as much as France,’ is here, is Quebec.
Not only is he here, but he’s in us,” he insisted, as he wanted to insist on a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold fever in Abitibi, the national engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec’s territory, comprises a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during a press conference.
"It is a position traditionally maintained by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been in place for a long time, and when the opportunity comes, I will take that position back on behalf of the government," he said.
"Considering climate change, we need to re-evaluate the North," he said, speaking of the north-west passage, which will be open all year round due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers occupying the territory to be a duty.”
What about the locals, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said the Quebec government would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the PQ of Ungava), have already initiated the consultation of about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transports and Natural Resources) occupies an important position, began the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a big meeting, not necessarily a summit, but a moment when "common visions will be provided."
The development of the North would, by the way, be based on the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be ‘coordinated, orderly and respect the environment’, he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we know how to stand out to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage to head the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Power Station to the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of Bay James, our party has always been able to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963, made another, conservative reference this time, the Roads to the North program.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest specified that its commissioning would be planned for 2012.
"All of this remains between us, but I feel that we will do it," he confessed to his militants, arousing applause.
In fact, the prime minister, who said in April there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a scrutiny in the fall, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stresses that he is certainly very committed, particularly in a federal council mission in China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the liberal head of state with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular of "constitutional aspirations" that have gone smoothly like oil: the PLQ demands above all the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a veto right on decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the draft of the North Plan has been welcomed skeptically.
PQ leader Pauline Marois has reopened the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
She said the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not respect its application.
If he had done it, we would have progressed today," Marois commented alongside Jean-Talon's candidate, Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has said it supports the adoption of the North Plan by the government.
"What we hope is that all this is not simply perceived as a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, a substitute for Mario Dumont, on his return from the holidays.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (iron of fate) of Harper's cabinet, who allowed himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.
Dishonoring in this way a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the Prime Minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are ahead of a government that is the only one, among all the western countries involved, who has not repatriated a citizen in Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time of the charges.
The only government that, despite having signed the Geneva Convention, refuses its word and leaves a child-soldier in inhumane conditions.
The only one who trusts a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
In particular, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Order of Canadian Lawyers invoke the return of Omar Khadraffin so that he can be subjected to a regular trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not matter if a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of oppression.
We still don’t realize it, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and “democracy,” a word that Harper never ceases to argue and that sounds so foolish on his lips.
Here we have arrived at a time when there is no morale: you can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen at the discretion of a minority head of government to date (see what it will be after October 14th...).
Numerous voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, Respect for Law and Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has abandoned what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
It's the shame here, Mr. Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following Orwellian logic, the latter claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a six-million-dollar diffamation lawsuit against three authors and a small squattered publishing house with the intention of launching a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a diffamation lawsuit, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone who dares to uphold a position contrary to hers.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, writers and publishers of the Canada Black book will have to spend a huge sum of money to organize their own defense and fight, with weapons you definitely learn, against an army of lawyers funded by the virtually fundless pockets of the mining company.
By the way, in these arms-learning battles, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensus regulation that emboldens the opposition and scare anyone who dares to speak again on the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was up to the public to present its view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada usually take place with exchanges of opinions and not with manganese shots.
It would therefore have been enough for the society to open its books, its documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications, and the funding of independent teams of researchers who could shed light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold doesn’t seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and misrepresents petitions and letters in support of Black Canada’s authors.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his contempt for that same audience is quite evident?
In the world of the Vice-President, it seems that this word refers exclusively to the fragrantly paid lawyers and not to the whole of the Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even deniers have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the audience that supports the authors and publishers of Canada Black does so first of all because it refuses the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges, and not in view of what many perceive as a sort of embarrassment (seeking the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Black an ultimatum of their intimate...
Beyond Garver’s surreal speech, the Barrack Gold’s sporting query constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in any democratic society.
It denies the right to cite authentic sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which constitute the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss inconvenient topics for the world’s richest businesses, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific norms as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have the right to replicate.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, has been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This goes at the expense of the university world, as does the same public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit abusive lawsuits.
Operation – Rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and congressional heads, representatives of the Republican and Democratic deployment, finally reached an agreement on the largest bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the <0x24>700 billion plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months, still needs to be ratified by the two chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: checks on its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms that guarantee the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses that have been dumped for non-payments, as well as a right to inspect the salaries paid to the managers of the enterprises.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement," said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been made in a way that protects the American economy and the American people from the current crisis in Wall Street," he said.
“This is the crucial point: if we hadn’t acted in this way, invaluable discomforts and disturbances would have flowed into Americans’ daily lives,” Republican Judd Gregg said in a statement.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The agreed time limit corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
Joined later in the negotiations, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential election were rather in favour of the agreement, but did not express their dissatisfaction ahead of the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democrat Senator Barack Obama deserves to have added some provisions to the deal, especially that will allow owners to maintain their home and that inherent in salaries for government-covered business executives.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to be pleased with.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American television screen.
Interviewed on another channel to see if he would vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
“As far as I’ve read, it’s something that we all need to digest and that will allow us to move forward.”
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The 700 billion-dollar plan aims to buy back from taxpayers money the doubtful, risky and unprofitable loans of U.S. financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble that has led first to the collapse of mortgage credits at risk (muti), then to extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and spark the freezing of liquidity and bankruptcy.
It was a group of Republicans in charge that aired the first draft of an agreement last week.
They seem to have come out of that blind alley since Democrats have accepted that the “toxic” asset of some companies in difficulty is only protected by the government, rather than bought.
In order to meet everyone in Congress, a provision was added that, if the government had to cope with losses over the next five years due to such a program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to be added to 100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of <0x24>350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the protected companies that will cost him dividends in case of profit and that will be able to resell when the waters are calmed.
Depending on the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay the loan loans for real estate loans and to set limits on remuneration and start-up allowances paid to the managers of the companies involved.
As of today, the plan's architects would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given free will.
Yesterday, in fact, there were several votes against the project, both in the Republican and in the Democratic context.
"Obviously Washington doesn't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Commission, told voters.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not to take advantage of the taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress nicknamed "the caucus of the skeptics", Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to carefully examine the way forward,” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, we once again witnessed the test of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion (<0x24>16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would renounce the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion (<0x24>2.9 billion) for the crisis of U.S. real estate loans.
Fortis has 85,000 employees and is part of Europe’s 20 largest banks and 10 largest insurers.
"It's not about lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In exchange, there is a risk of influence and voting rights in banking matters.
It’s certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that the times are uncertain.”
During this period, at the other extreme of the Manica, the British government seems to be on the verge of nationalizing another bank in bulk for the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take charge of the current loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion (<0x24>75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be you to buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Committed Icon
The beauty of the blue eyes was for a long time his ass in the sleeve, for others his weak spot.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the smiling smiling?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity, and apparent talent would have driven him out of that circle of powerful devotees to true sacred monsters.
What a constant!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday at the age of 83, in his Connecticut ranch after lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the past few years.
Less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and who for a long time was a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spokesman for freedom and the development of dramatic beliefs.
Mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the ultimate mark of quality.
Since he recognized a whole invaded country of the safe made man, the warrior of the Pacific war, proud in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, he subsequently attended the New York Actor Studio, before triumphing in theater, television and early cinema.
The same man who was a civil rights activist was also the car driver who ranked second to the 24 Hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although he was part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadows of a reserved, discreet, engaged star, allergic to the scandals of the show-business, of which you will never be able to fully reveal the mystery.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman’s disappearance was a heartbeat for cinemas, while his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is being re-proposed through its interpretations.
Butch Cassidy's fascinating cowboy (1969) and the boy unable to wish for his focused wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Roof that Shed adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), disturbed by a marriage that did not keep his promise.
Many more Paul Newman has gone to history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Lassú Someone Loves Me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and reprised after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute badass in the excellent Left, Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter and revengeful billiard player in The Spaccone, Robert Rossen's magnificent film (1961), The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which earned him in 1987 the only Oscar on 9 nominations.
That face over the years, it was his.
It's him again.
The epochs happen through its path.
Young people know him especially for the cult movie Slap Shot- Dry Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, the Coen brothers.
The circle had closed with a last role as the father of the Irish mafia in the Age of my father, in 2003.
Unlike most film legends who soon abandoned the trade, Newman will stay in the halls for a long time, denouncing Hollywood throughout his sweepstakes, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, called it, with a tip of irony, "a lively challenge to underplaying", deeming his performance exaggerated.
The profession has not always been a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to the role of the young actor: neurotic characters, drunkards or desperate, of whom he expressed banging and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, pubic sensitivity.
The first time Jennifer, in 1968 (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the role of the protagonist, drew a subtle female portrait of the melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott for an overdose, dedicated him in 1984 to the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless compliments that Newman received yesterday, his great friend and old gunman Robert Redford (who had performed together in The Left and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great features of the missing actor.
Beyond a legendary career, there is a great civil rights activist, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of the Hollywood Derivative.
We will have shaved her face to stand out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging her a choice of bad taste, though born as gag.
The proceeds from those sales were, however, allocated to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, instead of sticking to his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter saying, "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there was a privilege.”
And it was equally a privilege for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Citizen model, then, and much more.
What has been produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & Partners?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will be discussed.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed within the framework of a criminal association that has caused significant damage, and of other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor’s Office, the money obtained from competition gangs, was used by them for private purposes, and they have often certified the execution of the activities by means of fake invoices.
The state and municipal money, totaling 65 million florins, ended in part in the cash registers of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, in part in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they took the money obtained from competition bans based on invoices for non-existing operations and the associations never met the obligations undertaken.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were fake.
To do this, the invoice blocks were purchased at the Józsefváros market, the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue the invoices, it was established, among other things, during the hike between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of the latter he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for consumption, on the model of these then the invoices were prepared to be forwarded to the competition bands, among others, to those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Much of this is the work of István Lados and András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, has written the reports necessary for obtaining funding.
One of the choices of Lados' studio trip was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and partners in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the restauranter, would not all enter the premises together.
Similarly, the invoice is issued in the summer of 2002 to the Fondazione Jobb Jöt<0xC5><0x91>ór, hereinafter referred to as Together to the Third Millennium, a form and content error report.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay there, however in the invoice included 130 guests.
But the compilers of the fancy invoices exaggerated when they reported to Pigal Kft., which also deals with catering, in which the accounting - according to information released to the judicial authorities - did not even include the documents on behalf of Jobb Jöt<0xC3><0xA5><0xC3><0xA5>rett and Hoppá companies.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s director, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and his invoices were shown, he soon realized that these were fake documents.
"On the stamp the name and the IVA game of our company were at the wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal reasons, it was not even the fact that according to the invoice a hundred people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
By the time the invoice was a restaurant and their restaurant is no longer functioning for a long time.
The assistant invoice compilers did not worry about informing themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, organizes only travel abroad, so they absurdly indicated on the invoice with cash payment travel to Hungary, which did not agree with the company's practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, the invoice also included VAT, while the activity of travelling to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was also wrong on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfälöp Kft. in favour of the foundation Jobb Jö<0xC5><0x91><0xC3><0x91><0xC3><0x93><0xC3><0x91><0xC3><0x81>rt, in fact on the services offered by the company it is necessary to apply the VAT to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the invoices, in addition to the fact that the employees of the hotel were only issued.
In addition, the "issuers" ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they indicated as activity carried out the transport of goods by road, as is known from the Prosecutor's Procedure, activity which was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
In addition, for formal defects - non-conforming invoice format, false stamp - it has been discovered that the invoices issued in favour of Együtt at Third <0xC3><0x88>vezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Cultural<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>l Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same was the case with Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Field, whose representatives have denied having issued the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there, precisely for this reason the curator of the liquidation of the company, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They have consciously issued invoices.
Another group of invoice issuers is made up of those who were aware of having to issue fictional invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Socialisták in favour of the foundation Together to the Third Évezredért Foundation of almost 4 million florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the accused, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictional invoices.
He has also collaborated with Zuschlag and members of the Biogate Kft in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of approximately 5 million florins to the Jobb Jöt<0xC5><0x91><0xC3><0xA5>rt Alapítvány Foundation, to the association Atlasz Egyesület and to the association Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület.
Neither movement of money because the prepared invoices were then cancelled, but the associations forgot to include this in their documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong to those who are connected to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorised at the request of the Director General of Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, who deals with the trade in fuel and automobiles.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computers, for a value of about 18 million florins.
According to the data of the investigation, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 bought these invoices.
The CEO of the company was a Romanian to whom between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would have forwarded documents relating to the company.
As far as we know, during the investigation, Kubatov acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Egyjütt at Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the counter-value was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian murators founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faispari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant, they had not received a job.
The companies were still useful to him because, at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the company’s founding documents, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to associations related to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generación.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov has issued 15 invoices to the various entities for a total value of 14.2 million florins.
The prosecution believes that Kubatov has deposited 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictional invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition ban.
Y-Generação e Szövetsèg a Modern Magyarzá<0xC5><0x99>tér in January 2006 presented a ban for the public utility agency of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins per head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the ban.
To prevent this from happening, they presented to TMA five fictional invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Public Education.
At the hearing, a part of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecution, will likely report on the progress of the production of the invoices.
Anyway, the most interesting thing could be if the accused number one, János Zuschlag, would decide to raise the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has promised several times to talk about everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
You have to see if it is in his interest, it could also be that the Socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to make the atonement goat.
Zuschlag could also have offended himself for now, since his requests for alleviation of his prison conditions, i.e. the granting of home arrests, have not yet been met.
While the perpetrators of irreparable commercial crimes and causing much greater damages can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The Psychology of Excess Licensing: Why Spend More Money?
At auction buyers are likely to spend more, to overvalue the goods.
New York University neuroscientists and economists have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in Science magazine men don’t want to stay back in a race like eBay auction, so they’re available to pay a higher price as well.
The research attempted to trace the nervous pattern of this "party" at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lot, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance imaging method (fMRI) they examined the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the auction game, where the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the body slipped under the brain cortex enters intense function when you lose the game.
This area of the brain, among other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-gratification" of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price rise is explained by scanning the vehement reaction of the striated body.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group conducted a financial follow-up survey.
In this investigation, three groups have tendered against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the actual value of the product concerned and they made their bet.
To another group in addition to this, they promised that in the event of winning, they would receive another <0x24>15 prize.
The third group, on the other hand, would receive <0x24>15 before the auction, but the group members would lose the money in the event of a loss at the auction.
The difference between the two groups was that for one of them the win was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
Testing the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the group that played "against loss" were willing to make higher bets than the control group or "winning".
“These results are not deducible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, so far, these explained the phenomena found in the auctions with the joy of winning and with the avoidance of risk.
Only the methods of creating neurological imaging have helped resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so we have come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to contact a doctor?
Almost half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is among the leading causes of death.
In Hungary the number of hepatitis patients is 100,000, of which only 7,000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know that they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and ittery, but their pathogens and diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g., water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal loss, saliva).
For travelers it is useful to get vaccinated against viruses A and B, there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellowish spots are formed on the skin and white of the eyes, the stools become clear and the urine dark, healing takes place within two to three weeks.
A million people die each year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancers and cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated it can cause cirrhosis of the liver and liver tumors.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens subtly destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
In the world today, the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Because even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease, it is worth consulting with a family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 worldwide by associations of patients.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to a recent survey, religious faith works as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more tolerable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
In the context of the bizarre investigation, an electroshock was performed on 12 Catholic believers and on as many atheists, while all of them watched a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
Based on the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain, it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first of a series of research in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University also take part.
The test took place exactly this way: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with Leonardo da Vinci's hermitage painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the exam hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would originate some kind of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it was not too different from the other and considered it to be a soothing effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time frame received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious or other theme painting.
The Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care" of them and "relaxed and were pervaded by peace".
Looking at the religious-themed image, they realized 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that a similar result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but one must find the appropriate image.
“We need to look for an image toward which very positive feelings are nourished, like a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality,” Wright added.
After the excellent results, only the question remains whether the painting of a Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of the same caliber is presented to believers, what effect could it have on pain control?
Would the vision of a virgin Mary of quality bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the 10th birthday, Google can say it’s in people’s pockets and in the sky above their heads; it knows where they’ve spent their holidays, what kind of outpatient they attend and what matters to them.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s directors, this is not enough yet.
What concerns skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they don’t really see the substance of Web 2.0.
Recently, Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect as much personal data as possible from its users, and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google’s founders: “let’s put all the information in a system!”
According to the Google director interviewed, after 10 years of revolutionary work, the company is still at the very beginning to be able to manage all the information.
Schmidt said he would like Google to answer questions like “What am I doing tomorrow?” or “What would be the right job for me?” but the software doesn’t know how to answer simple questions because they don’t know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their search on the Internet, the exact words you are looking for are recorded, which IP address is searched for, and on which page the data subjects stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search started two years ago, e.g. users can store their browsing history, they can relate to what they have searched and clicked, these then long go will generate much better tailored results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our previously stated and recorded preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I’m doing? – ask worried users about Google’s data monopoly.
In most cases, Internet users’ counter-reactions are provoked by the fear proven by the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the sense of guilt, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or even the rebellion to power.
However, one fact is confirmed, i.e. that all searched expressions are not only recorded but can also be provided to third parties in reasoned cases, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of this in recent times has perhaps been the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify the pedophiles from the page of the Orkut community maintained by Google.
The Internet users concerned about personal rights, on the other hand, sought relief in May when the company - in agreement with the association of electronic legal protection EFF - successfully proved the truth in court against the FBI: neither can it be later forced to Google with any re-informing of the matter.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully hijacked almost 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search terms obtained in reference to the Child Protection Act confirmation passed years earlier, but still failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of two web pages and keywords.)
Google’s opinion is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data smear Google because they believe that this is how their privacy and privacy are affected by starting to use their services and rise up with the rebellion of multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and the proliferation of computer enthusiasts, activists and users appearing in many countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as a conquest of the world due to Windows, as both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code kept constantly updated, and the program package is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the colossus software.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which involves just one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 talks only about collaboration, intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
An average young person can create profiles on multiple community pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, can link them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his musical tastes, all of these can insert them into systems like FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which he or she can automatically appear on his or her more photographs.
In the meantime, we read about numerous instances from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common circle of friends, comes to know easily with whom she spent the night her cheating boyfriend or a company can completely fire an employee of her own because she has written a sincere opinion about her life, she is a firm.
Those who live an online life do so to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that lies behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid the Google monopoly can do so (starting with, for example, Scroogle using Google’s search engine but at the same time leaving no trace).
Not a few people who don’t sign up for community pages to not be found, Google’s online applications, from text processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions that aren’t linked to huge server parks and that don’t make up our best profile so far.
Public opinion is not so secretly awaiting the moment when Google will pull out its claws.
At present, the company with its <0x24>156 billion worth of value is worth more than IBM (<0x24>140 billion), Intel (<0x24>124 billion) or Coca-Cola (<0x24>110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces also threaten Microsoft advertising agencies’ software revenues, not just big-time services, but a record-breaking number.
However, the critical observers next to all of this find all of them alarming points: the corporate summit, for example, has completely rejected the protest of the employees after having doubled the line of the corporate asylum, has considered too costly the repeated catering agreement in 2006, and Google has been interested in the daily catering of the employees to the government, which has given them all this.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is certain, that the predictable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some people believe that our scanning and storage system will have a problem, we will take care of other books and magazines that Google will take care of such issues.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the famous Cory Doctorow’s Scroogled story describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped <0xC3><0x93>zd's double killer to make traces disappear
Police have questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, who are suspected to have helped make the traces of the crime disappear, a spokesman for the Borsod Police Quest said on Tuesday.
The young people have acknowledged the crime to their accused, and are currently accused of favoring.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI's information, defend themselves on foot.
The benefit is punishable by up to 5 years in prison.
The suspect in the dual murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He's suspected of premeditated multi-homicide committed for profit.
The survey found that the 23-year-old man had a heavy debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off the debt, which is why last Wednesday he tricked his creditor into a construction site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million, about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion, for the purchase of 100% of the stock listing of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer advanced by the Poles even though the Czechs had previously ruled out the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60% of its securities within a few months.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 says that the offer of the Poles represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all interested parties the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not rule out that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion SEK.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Banca <0xC4><0x8C>eská Spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%.
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday on the international economic crisis already talk about "a second September 11".
The global financial disaster has happened thanks to the American president - the Republic accuses - who has not been able to compact his party behind a law that has been drafted in a hurry, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as billionaire superfinancer Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second September 11th.
A portion of the Madrid press also sees the expiatory goat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of U.S. political leadership has thrown the world economy on the brink of drought.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is growing and the world will suffer from it.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but as a result of the congressional vote there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to leave the threat behind - mentions the Days-Anzeiger in Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a bailout to bartering financial institutions and with taxpayer money can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse like in a domino effect then neither the financial means nor the improvised new solutions will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for EU Member States to overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion, according to Vienna’s Der Standard, which says that European taxpayers, like American taxpayers, will have to put their hand on their portfolio to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent like a tsunami.
The "savers" should not immediately blow up the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion, however, it would be better if they established in which case it is appropriate to touch taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
The smart machine mimics the flight of the calabrone
What could be the best method to develop anti-collision technologies if you don’t imitate the sensors of obstacles that are in nature?
For example, those of the bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the calabrons gave Nissan engineers an initial strategic lead on how to build the next generation of collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotic mini car with bee properties, with the ultimate goal of creating a system capable of scanning all collisions.
Flying bees form their own oval personal space that really resembles our protective shield - explained to the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technology and research and development.
Important is the role of the bee view, capable of a view of 300 degrees in each direction.
The engineers came up with the idea of telemetric laser to copy the function of bee vision.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters within a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately turns it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, unlike the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive way.
"If it weren't, the robot car wouldn't be able to react quickly to avoid collisions," said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the more damaging and inner layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in one eye.
But unlike bees, the deviation can not go up or down or in diagonal, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steering of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as an option available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lighter, high-density lithium polymer batteries, which means that they are longer than lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantaneity of the intelligent reaction is important, not the data processing or even less the ability to store it.
This robot has to process some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so only uses a few dozen Kb of memory.
There is no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards developing a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, according to Nissan, can be installed on standard vehicles within 10 years.
Further application possibilities can be represented by unification with GPS satellite navigation system which by avoiding obstacles present on the road leads to destination.
They also found the child's name very expensive.
The written version of the <0x24>700 billion economic bailout law for the purchase of disproportionate loans has been drafted, to be applied in multiple parts.
In the first step, half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements negotiated until midnight on Saturday, the congressional leaders decided on a <0x24>700 billion bailout plan after a debate lasting for days, Reuters reported.
"We have taken serious steps forward," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, according to which the deal is only left to be put on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the plan’s compromise.
Treasury Minister Henry Paulson speaking about the outcome of the compromise stated: the program will work and will be effective, but there is still a lot to do. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about reversing the economic car.
The written version of the plan was released before the opening of the Asian markets at 8 p.m. in Washington (2 p.m. on Monday night in Central Europe), but it did not bring significant stock market growth.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the defined 2008 Economic Stabilization Bill on the program, after which it will touch the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with the Pelosi on Saturday evening, then welcomed the news of the deal to the White House.
We are pleased with the progress made tonight and we greatly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy," said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program, however, differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal, which predicted that the <0x24>700 billion would all be spent on the purchase of securities with disproportionate credit behind them.
Now, as a first step, you can spend up to half the sum of <0x24>700 billion, <0x24>250 billion immediately after the Congress vote on Monday, with these the Treasury Ministry will buy bonds with disproportionate credits behind, the fate of the remaining <0x24>100 billion will be decided by the president.
A special college will monitor the program to which the President of the Federal Reserve also takes part.
The spending of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Department can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously purchase credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" credits.
The purchase can be made through auctions and directly - they have announced competent departments.
The legal norm makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance scheme where the Treasury Department guarantees the means of concern, for which the companies will pay an appropriate price for the likely damages.
Henriz Paulson said the law provides the means necessary for <0x24>700 billion to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of wrong financial means, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to get us ready to introduce the newly signed law.
The directors of the banks in crisis and awaiting state aid think instead that the government will limit their success, defined by the overseas slang simply as golden parachutes.
The limitations on payments will only occur in some cases, and the limitations will depend on how the Treasury Department will offer the aid.
Essentially, the limitation means that if the ministry buys within the framework of an auction, it will impose a surplus on the gold parachute, unless they send the defunct bank manager to retire.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate credits, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the money of the directors is not exaggerated.
In addition, existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the limitation is only valid for new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first case in the U.S. history of the entry into force of a legal restriction on the remuneration of general administrators - said Barney Frank, president of the House of Representatives' Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the state has the right to take a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of the taxpayers, since in the end they can also earn us if the economy, and with it the saved bank, will get back up.
The bill includes that in the next five years, the president must submit to Congress a proposal on how to repay taxpayers the expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there have been those on both sides who have expressed their doubts about the project.
That’s not what American citizens have asked us not to defend taxpayer dollars,” California Republican MP Darrell Issa said.
His Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur believes the measures were taken by the same people who were responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industry Prices Continue to Rise
The prices of domestic industrial sales in August 2008 increased by 0.1% from the previous month, by 12.9% compared to August 2007, reports the Hungarian Central Institute of Statistics.

As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial production costs were higher by 0.7% compared to the previous month and by 3.2% compared to a year ago.
The prices of domestic industrial sales reported in the previous month have only increased by 0.1%.
The prices of domestic sales in the manufacturing sector also rose by a minimum of 0.1%, compared to July.
The biggest increase in prices in August 2008 occurred in the leather and footwear industry (2.8%), especially bags and belts with 4.6% and the production of shoes with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price level of plastic and chemical raw materials has led to a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the chemicals and products sector.
Prices decreased in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.9%) and to a minimum extent in the wood processing (0.1%)
The prices of paper production, editorial and typographical activities have not changed.
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices rose by 0.3% in August in domestic industrial sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the rise in gas prices by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing industry, the largest increases were in the petroleum products processing sector (32.4%).
In the manufacture of products derived from the processing of metals, the increase in prices was 13.2%, 11% in the food, beverage and tobacco production representing a decisive weight.
Prices decreased in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.3%).
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the rate of price increases ranged from 0.6% to 9.1%.
In total in the manufacturing industry last year, prices rose by 10.2%.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors exceeded those of last year by 18.7%.
In domestic sales among target groups of sectors, the largest increase in monthly prices occurred in August in the sectors producing investment goods (0.7%).
In the sectors that produce consumer goods, prices have increased by 0.3%, in the energy and subsequent use sector, prices have not changed compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, the largest increase in prices was observed in the energy and subsequent use sector (16.8%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, the increase was 6.8%, and for investment goods a decrease of 1.4% was measured.
Industrial export sales prices calculated in florins rose by 1.1% in August compared with the previous month, compared to 12 months they decreased by 3.9%.
The Hungarian florin in the course of a month weakened against the euro by 1.7%, compared to the dollar by 7.1%, compared to August 2007 strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and by 15.9% against the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around January 12 the U.S.-Hungarian visa exemption agreement may enter into force - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
In his opinion, "now everything depends on the fact that overseas is being built in time the electronic input and control system".
However, he drew attention to the fact that the new system will no longer have entry permits, however, before departure tourists will have to register.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy will continue negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will hand over the Order of the Cross Medal of the Hungarian Republic to the Star and initiate talks with foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain have also deployed in support of the banks’ rescue plan.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates for the two major U.S. parties, secured Sunday their support for the <0x24>700 billion government plan to save banks, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration after the days-long marathon talks on Sunday night announced that they had concluded a principle agreement on the banks' bailout plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package of freezing the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to prove themselves more fit than their rivals to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls with putting economic issues at the forefront Obama has once again recovered some advantage, while McCain’s advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment of vice president of Sarah Palin, has disappeared.
In a speech in Detroit, Obama expressed the hope that Congress would quickly approve the <0x24>700 billion bill.
He pointed out that the proposal contains those steps of consumer protection that were also supported by him.
“Now we have to act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability,” he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss out on defining McCain’s economic ideas.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained that “all of us will put down this situation with difficulty (...) but not doing anything is not a path to go.”
The Republican senator reported that the proposal includes the establishment of a control committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outputs of the top managers, things he was insisting on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a merit role in the agreements, instead he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill on Monday.
German-speaking world press review
The right pole is intact, only within the pole voters have become more self-aware - so Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the online edition of the German left-wing magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours his parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad couple Beckstein-Huber took office.
The Christian-socialists have modernized Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of times is at the same time a problem for all Christian democracy, as is also for Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that exactly ten years ago had been feasible: the undisputed hegemony of a party-state ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had dropped to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the elections to the Bundestag in 2005 still in the period of the so-called Stoiber.
The reason for this is the consequential modernization in the region, which devours the parents.
Sociologists predicted it 40 years ago, but the weather was very wrong, but the secularization, the results of education, the settlement of the East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with the increase in opportunities and the political consequences are obvious.
The right pole is intact, only within the pole voters have become more self-conscious, critical, obstinate.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups themselves have distanced themselves from the CSU: freelance professionals, craftsmen, graduates and graduates.
Here the support for the CSU fell below 40%.
The Press (diepresse.com)
In the article "The presidents of the parties are stuck in coalition issues" he deals with the confused domestic political situation created after the elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> intends to deal with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits SP<0xC3><0x96> from intervening in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
Elections have been held, now it all revolves around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast by public television the leaders of the parties have just seen the cards.
Werner Faymann, president of SP<0xC3><0x96>, has confirmed that he wants to deal with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice chancellor.
As he stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course was rejected in any case.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer has reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, the collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
If his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still an open matter in the party, issues should be discussed in any case within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
BZ<0xC3><0x96>’s leader Jörg Haider has reiterated that it is open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to assume the responsibility of governing,” Haider said.
Járóka: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
The European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organised this year by France with the European Union's turntable presidency, has begun today in Paris.
Lívia Járóka, member of the European People's Party Fidesz in her message to the plenary as the main speaker of the congress, drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and, in turn, the most serious obstacle to their assertion.
The French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Vladimír <0xC5><0xA0>pidla, opened the conference at the highest level.
The conference was invited to include governments, European social partners and representatives of the largest European civil and rights organisations within the framework of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz PE parliamentary group, recalled, in addition to discrimination in employment, that Roma are being driven out of the labour market in the first place due to their low schooling.
"Most young Roma do not have a middle-level degree, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a small number of them can achieve a higher education degree."
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in enforcing human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the EU Member States.
In her view, it is necessary to raise awareness of these connections in the broader range between Roma and non-Roma people.
Indeed, the sooner a Roma starts school, the more opportunities it has to become a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid on income and consumption, they contribute to the nation’s budget.
"The right to European citizenship of Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools," Lívia Járóka said.
In her view, the European Union needs a union of purpose and action to accelerate the desegregation of schools, and that is why it is essential to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly complied with.
“The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, we must give Roma children the opportunities given by the democratic space so that they can contribute as citizens fully to the future of Europe,” Járóka said.
As a sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities held every year since last year's Berlin meeting is to ensure a single forum to promote the anti-discrimination and equal opportunities targets set at the state and European levels.
CSU: pity for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the packed Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Although the bad electoral defeat has not yet fallen, the discussion of personal issues has been postponed at the summit of the Bavarian CSU.
The party president Erwin Huber and regional governor Günther Beckstein still remain in their place, the question is as long as mercy endures.
From the fate of the tandem that has suffered a catastrophic loss of 17% of votes will decide the party's extraordinary congress in the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticised politicians have made it clear in any case that they are not attacked with all the forces in the chair.
They tried so hard to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that one day after the "Bavarian Tsunami" claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the peak of his career, the Christian-Social Union got 60.7%, now after the coup against Stoiber they fell to 43.4%.
The CSU has been an "absolute monarch" in Bavaria for 46 years, giving 18% of Germany's GDP.
However, conservatives in the southern region are always of fundamental importance for the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to coalition anyway.
As the first sign of the reorganization within the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered a possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the narrow exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the Liberal Electors exhibiting right-wing values for a coalition government.
For a strange joke of fate on the list of Free Electors, that Gabriele Pauli entered the legislature whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as a coup opportunity by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treated the woman with great ambitions unrequited.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their forces to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
The former regional governor and former president of the CSU on September 28th has defined the bitterest day of his political career as the most active role of Stoiber.
On Monday, Huber issued some statements loyal to the CSU, according to which they would deserve more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be a chancellor after the September 2009 Bundestag elections unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, is re-established with joint forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, the CSU’s land loss will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the injured CSU, but the social-democratic crisis is still going on.
The SPD reached its lowest score since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Nor did a representative of the opposition enter the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of well-being and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead explains with the bugs committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the 2006 presidential mandate re-elected, would "renew the parliamentary term for the fourth time in the subsequent circus amendments".
The ODS thus renounced a previously assessed boycott.
Behind the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which asked for a credit to reduce Russian natural gas imports more and more expensive and agreed to give the Russians the political pipelines in possession of the Beltransgaz that can pass through the country politically, and I considered to improve the EU's relationship with other Luijer.
It referred to a distension that the OSCE, when assessing the election campaign, placed emphasis on positive movements rather than shortcomings, such as the ban on a third of opposition candidates.
The fast-paced OSCE report on Monday also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this, according to the opposition, there is a noticeable improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to make a small comparison with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, although Russia considers two forms of Indians, with which the Bielorrussia is one on the federal state.
We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," he told our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate of the 2006 election opposition, it is desirable that he remain despite the fact that "power has been afraid to bring even one opponent into a weightless Parliament".
The opposition does not provide for protests against the results but rather seeks to bring to voters the message of the need for economic reforms.
Obviously we have many problems, we have to print the newspapers of the opposition in Russia, for the distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but also so I see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that even the principal ceto of the social henchmen, the chief of the aided reikinanti, the one of the most thoughtful.
Due to the country's debt and the increase in the economic deficit, it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security "remembering the sepulchral silence" - thinks Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have judged the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, the president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunette: "From now on breakfast before work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were rotating doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today onwards, this new measure is taking place against the smarts, against those who stamp and then go for a coffee at the bar during work hours.
The news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The swivel doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," the minister said.
“Now a new season of responsibility and transparency is opening up.
This is reformism,” Brunetta continues.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi, "the choice of turning doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There was no resistance on the part of the employees, assures the Secretary-General: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was everyone's collaboration".
In other words, no more breakfast at work hours; no more coffee and corneal.
Brunette's word, which suggests, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister notes that "in three months the absences due to public employees' disease have decreased by 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people at work in a year".
And it adds that it is necessary to make public administration more efficient
“The salary dynamics in the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates,” the minister explains.
Meanwhile, thousands of civil servants have joined forces to challenge the rules of the Brunette decree by adhering to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service today slammed numbers about the lowest absenteeism at work due to disease - the consumers' association writes - the people of 'open-handed nerds' are constantly growing.
In fact, there are thousands of correct and productive public administration employees in Italy who have joined forces to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, the Tar will challenge the exclusion of additional economic treatments for illnesses dependent on cause of service; the extension of the time zones of availability of the sick worker, within which inspection visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions wanted by the Minister.
Work Incidents, Napolitano: "Crucial Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the Victims of Work Accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data circulated by the Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Disabled Labourers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "strong appreciation for the constant associative commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of victims' families and the awareness of public opinion."
“Of course, an outrageous ‘simply’, sincerely shared, has arisen in the face of tragedies that, due to their size, spark the screams of the media and the involvement of public opinion, but the daily reality proposes dramatic, even repetitive, cases in their dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a resource problem: it is decisive to invest in education and information.
The many initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness-raising by young people facing the world of work are of particular importance.
It is necessary to keep the attention of the phenomenon alive, not to give up on its social gravity, to apply and improve legislative rules.
The president of the House, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a decisive commitment aimed at putting an immediate end to them".
“The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not remove that the number of white deaths is still impressive,” said Anmil’s president Pietro Mercandelli.
“In fact, we would not want this ‘downward trend’ to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention is relaxed that the tragedy explodes.
“We believe that at a general level it is still too little to counteract the phenomenon of injuries and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our opinion, it is necessary - he stressed Mercandelli - more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world."
"There is a further effort - he added - in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, it requires a greater sense of responsibility from employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the levels of indemnity protection for labour victims" and the "assiscialist derivative towards which the system is pushing in recent years".
"The goal is therefore to return the insurance guarantee to the worker because the fate of those who are injured should not depend on spontaneous or occasional emancipation provided by the legislator."
Mp3 readers under charge, put hearing at risk
Listening to high-volume music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injury.
This is what the European Commission reports, citing the opinion of the European Union's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risks (CSRs) published today in a statement published in Brussels.
"From this scientific opinion, it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day holding the high-volume device risk permanent loss of hearing capacity."
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unconsciously harm their hearing irreparably,” says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings - the EU's responsible continues - a clear risk emerges and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is that we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, in order to ensure that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise caused by them.
"Scientists confirm that there is a cause for concern and the European Commission will now consider together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and mobile devices."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
These damages can be greatly limited by using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of noise exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music equipment if they listen to music at a high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceed current limits on the maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in these conditions for longer periods of time are at risk of permanent hearing loss after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the sums will be withdrawn.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which has settled this morning in its new headquarters behind the Terme di Caracalla.
Within six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once the batters are closed in March, the Joint and the Municipal Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official bullet" of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - he stresses - It will have to make proposals for an idea for the development of Rome that the political decision makers, who remain the Joint and the Municipal Council, will then be able to take advantage of.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place to work out a great project for Rome.
In March it will finish its work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise timeframe.
In June we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital."
To those who accuse the Commission of uselessness, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replied: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If there will be quality, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics overwhelms everyday management and the emergencies that occasionally occur.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, from a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.”
In addition, the mayor of Rome pointed out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a carriage: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the citizens of Rome and will serve to reason and engage the best intelligences expressed by the Capital".
For Alemanno, in fact, "we need to have a strategic reference design, neither closed nor immovable, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, which it absolutely needs, thinking in a unified spirit about its future."
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the current municipal borders but will look far beyond" not only in the view of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital but "also in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
He wrote a prominent American politician who makes us feel independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks against Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a web: “This person is full of ambition.
“Obama has a big face: he thinks he will win the highest office of a nation he has ever had in all two governors and five black senators!”
Actually, they’re attacks that don’t say much; they’re clearly racial attacks and don’t respond to voters’ question: Will there be a good president? So there’s the polls; they all say Obama will win and with a good breakup.
There are people who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the vicinity of the south of the United States, wrote an editorial: Once in the cabin to vote we know who will vote for the American patriot.
It comes out of a side of the U.S. mentality kept covered until the last.
“Tell me what you want, then we’ll think about where to put the crucifix, whether on Obama or on McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things have never been said before, which seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: What were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
It's changing America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to fight in the seat.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack their bags.
Yet, Iraq for the most part was Bush’s weakness.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to do.
In the United States, the economic turmoil is also felt by journalists: in the newspapers it is time to cut. And many blame the internet, "assassin" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control regarding the future.
Well, nowadays, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as they once were.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
Also, the cuts made in the newsroom, the room where editors work to put newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if you do not want traditional journalism as the general public wants it to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that the national newspaper is going the wrong way.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses are opening a doorway to the internet, for many viewers as the "assassin" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn of has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing the technology in the hope that they will “do something good” for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism today is between those who run the newsrooms – i.e. the directors – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values, while locally the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “work safety.”
Executives who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years are 47% nationally.
Staff reporters are up to 30%.
That of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV, and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of “take it or leave it,” take or leave it.
Directors almost always get big salaries, while the editor can also earn <0x24>10,000 a month, in addition to pension and insurance payments.
For the holidays, then, reasoning becomes complicated: all days after the first year, all after the third to reach 15 days overall after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, often "pain" themselves during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: ROME TRIBUNALS, DANILO COPPOLA RESTAURANT IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had requested to move from his town, Grottaferrata, to a residence in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl counter-attack investigation.
In the course of the trial under his charge, last week, he obtained the discharge from the homeowners transformed into an obligation of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to travel from the town of province to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, however, these displacements (which the PM said otherwise) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuse him.
The Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already emerged a few days ago with the House of Representatives’ vote against the <0x24>700 billion bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times confirms yesterday that the current crisis is breaking apart the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old soul East Coast, moderate, favourable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to the "Centre of Washington" and the world of finance.
The soul, by the way, which has been made prepotently alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
This, however, is only an example of the changes, of the great changes, that the current economic earthquake may be pre-announced or already left unnoticed: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not only here.
Both in the U.S. and Europe, the crisis seems to act as an accelerator of long-incubating phenomena and in the new climate they solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary relaunch, of the double category of State-sovereignty in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which have, yes, close ties with abroad, but which, above all, see very largely the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
What immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically global but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or lacks much to say: the European Union gives the flagrant proof that, as usual, it divides between different interests and between different state strategies, it cannot decide on any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each individual state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and above all, the provision of funds: since when it comes to the narrowing, only the states possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources can try to put them back in what they want.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incommensurable value, in certain circumstances, which probably no market and international organization will ever have to a similar extent.
This new emphasis placed by the crisis on the national-status element is, by the way, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the intangible, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will have little to do with the material, but we will have to do with the material things we have to create.
All things that, look a little, can certainly be transported from one place to another on the earth, but are nevertheless absolutely linked to a confined space, to a territory.
So that those who find themselves to be sovereign will certainly have several more cards than those who are not, those who have the misfortune of living in a place without harvests, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that presupposes a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness needs authoritative leadership, the request of someone who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species, turned out to be so inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And at the same time something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an insufficiency, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
In other words, there seems to be more and more ways, in vast sectors of the population, to be convinced that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, to have made their time and to be increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majors.
The demand for leadership, in short, fuels underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimation of the ruling classes and traditional political attitudes, which also manifests itself in the sudden "revolts" of the elections or in the sudden turns of the collective moods of these last and last days (in the last few years, in the last few years).
It seems that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone would make it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not now taking shape in the strata of the economics, which can create deeper and deeper crises of societies.
In the face of all this, speaking of a "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not for nothing.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has gone very close to us.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters, the scholars managed to keep a body of 100 kilograms glued on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scientists is an evolution of those existing that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of the geeks, covered with microscopic hair that manage to ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests conducted on various materials, such as glass, teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time “breaks easily from the wall,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
- "This material could be useful as a transient adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic appliances, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may be related to aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new sticker.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, California scholars presented a sticker made of microfiber as hair that self-cleans from dust while moving on a surface to always maintain perfect adherence.
Drugs: Never with fruit juices
Beware of apple juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, especially in the summer because they are dehydrated and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some life-saving drugs alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their efficacy with serious health consequences.
To reaffirm the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with taking certain medicines David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, has released a new warning of the health of the fruit juices, releasing a new warning of the melanie, and a glass of water: just a glass of water.
Pomegranate juice had already ended up under accusation because it was considered responsible for increasing to levels considered toxic the effects of some antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological drugs.
RISK PHARMACEUTIQUES - The Italian drug agency itself reported it in a bulletin two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to pay attention to what you drink in case you take medications such as Diazepam or Met.
Not just pomegranate - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active ingredients inhibited by pomegranate and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: "These findings are generally reported immediately to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually make changes to the informational notes of the drugs.
So always read the leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear, don’t let us impress but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification,” the expert said.
The Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the top critics of the Bush administration's foreign policy and economic choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron failed, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that sparked no few controversies and that for years was remade to the economist, but that now turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and also a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a divulger with a "very aggressive, particularly critical style against the Bush administration's excesses of liberalism".
Open Office, here's the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the best-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, behind whom SUN Microsystem watches, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with various new features: to the welcome screen and to the revised and less spartan interface, are added other more substantial ones such as the new format, the native format, the standard format for the OS, and the Apple OS Do.
Attention also to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by email, or the ability to import PDF files into the graphics processing form, while preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical Adobe format graphics with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene with multiple hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the text processor, each employee is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition during the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, in the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to release the final result.
The English version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
As well as for Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be shipped home or at work.
And if the theme of freelance can be a draw for the spread in the houses, it is precisely in business that the Open Office suite tries the big bet, already able to count on several projects made in the public administration and schools.
And there are also the realities that offer an ideal training, consulting and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding video writing of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint emulated presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and given that today we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third ranked and winner of the top climber shirt.
To report the news is the website of the daily L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive racer in the Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
Kohl’s blood samples are among those made in the last weeks by Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analysis confirms Cera’s positivity, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will face two years of canonical disqualification.
The news of Kohl’s positivity at the third-generation Epo is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian put himself on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also awarding himself the best climber.
Immigrants: NEW YORK TIMES SI CHIEDE,ITALY IS RAZISIS?
Italy "from a country of emigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
Is this turning Belpaese into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is asking in a long article that dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the Nyt calls the "North paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Northern League".
In confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Nyt also cited the intolerance episodes of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
The new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the barriers on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestine people is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic underlined the trend: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale has asked that the state and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Students victims of car rentals up to 900 euros per room
The university rent market is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey of Sunia, the union of tenants, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on very serious characters to the point of excluding entire bands of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that families of origin should bear - explains Laura Mariani, the head of the study study office of the Sunia, also resident - in these cities a strong demand for market on the part of students.
In most cases, rental offers also contain a number of violations: free, unregistered contracts, without a fee limit, related sub-leases.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the revision of taxation, can calm prices.
Looking at the detail of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it is necessary about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Black Band area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Vittoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, they need 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 single in Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples you need 300/450 euros for a bed, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari for one bed you need 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of leasing to non-community students is more common, such as in Perugia, there is a further anomaly: an increase of about 25/30% of the fee applied to foreign students than applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradise, cities cancel historic halls
The historic cinema halls are closing in favor of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinema is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of the large multi-salles and the consequent death due to the consummation of the mono-salles in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that seem unforgettable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and loads of memory,"it's as if a friend, a friend with whom we shared a piece of road and so many emotions," observes the director of New Cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago sold to Tornatore the Oscar for a prize and the Grand Prix for a prize for a prize of always the canoe and the jury.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of practitioners, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed the battering 316 cinemas of the traditional type, and to pay the greatest scotch are mainly the rooms in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Roma, 6 less in Torler, 5 in Paer
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost monosala cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first cause of their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-sala cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, “it is useful that new structures are being built but it would need to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into the multiplex.
Not to mention the lack of appropriation for the fund in favour of the practitioners: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, they would need between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 million and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million a year.”
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about the closures, decided to run to the repairs with the signing of a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote cinemas in the old town and in the outskirts.
Among the rules provided are measures of tax relief in favour of operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special stop and parking fees.
“It’s an initiative that I like,” observes Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is true, however, that in order to counteract the strapoter of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Super Cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Paradise cinema", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the dusty posters on the other side.”
Relationships between politics and 'nrangheta' detained Mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to uniformize the municipality's choices in the interests of the Piromalli skull."
The charges are heavy that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria address the mayor and the deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested today for external competition in mafia association.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his granddaughter lawyer, the same name as the boss, already convicted for association for mafia-shaped criminals, sentenced to compensate 10 million euros.
"In spite of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed a willingness to pay advice to attorney Piromalli.
"It would thus have been granted to the cossa - the judges write - to officially enter within the municipalities by facilitating the already huge possibilities of control and addressing the public administration."
The president of the Calabrese regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organized maliciousness are many" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the collision is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'drangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
The arrests this morning follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromalli skull.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always for alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been raised from the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been elected head of a center-right coalition, following the ballot in May 2006.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He summoned the then Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti, accusing him of arranging everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest warrant signed this morning, explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for the modification of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PM writes, emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a wider group known to be close to the Piromalli, uniformizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the skull".
When the energy comes from where the big ones are now falling into the field
It is an extinct landfill, which occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have put their eyes, and now they try to put their hands, colossal as the Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the sea movements has been studied for a hundred years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmental pressures and the new increase in oil give the industry a boost.
In 2007, the World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by ocean wave engines.
This amount would be twice that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would be currents and tides.
Colossians at attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed a revolutionary step.
At two years’ distance to bet on marine energy are more and more and among these companies always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying technologies on ocean energy - said a spokesman for a company affiliated with the U.S. oil giant to the Wall Street Journal - and is considering cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a signal not recently, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to the Chevron, there are the New York Verdant Power Inc. and the New Jersey Ocean Power to travel the energy road that comes from the sea and the amounts invested so far, although not known in detail, according to observers, indicate an upward interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts speak of a technology still at dawn, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to cause major problems to the ecosystem.
In order to produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies with greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The pressure of the waves, which moves the booms up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure from pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
Pressure rotates a turbine that in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent offshore through submarine cables.
For now there are four such facilities under construction, only waiting for federal approval and part of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six submarine turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of water when there are tides rotates the turbine blades, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers awaiting the necessary permissions to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electricity Research, deserves at this time the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely on the energy of tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others overlooking the coast, have already invested <0x24>7 and a half in 2008 and projected investments up to <0x24>35 million for 2009.
