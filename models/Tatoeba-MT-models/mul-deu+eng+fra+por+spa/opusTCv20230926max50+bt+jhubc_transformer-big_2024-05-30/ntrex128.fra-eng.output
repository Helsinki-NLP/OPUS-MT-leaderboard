Members of the Assembly of Wales worried about ‘going for puppets’
Welsh voters are shocked by a proposal to replace their title with the abbreviation MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment of the Assembly's name, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of scrutiny.
A Labour elector said his group was concerned that the slogan “ride with Twp and Pwp”.
For non-Wales readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotte.
According to one of its members, Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not “satisfied” and has proposed other formulas.
The conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionette), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the English letter u of the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation introducing the name change, has indicated that "the final decision on the appointment of members of the Assembly falls to the latter".
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 (2007) grants the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as a Welsh Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the issue of membership, the Commission is in favour of Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a vast majority of Welsh people prefer MWP.
It seems that members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach a consensus could prove to be a real puzzle for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a bill on name change in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include further amendments to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the issue of the name during the debates on the bill.
Macedonia: referendum on the change of country name
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be named the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbor, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted that the name of Macedonia constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on the accession of its neighbouring country to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum, said he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Harlem: Difficult churches, St. Martin's bells reduced to silence
“The elderly people I talked to say that traditionally there was a bar and a church in every corner of the street,” Adams said.
“There is no more of it today.”
According to him, it is normal for bars to be rarified.
Nowadays, “we don’t frequent each other the same way anymore,” he explains.
“We used to go to the bar like our neighbor’s, but that’s no longer the case.”
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will run out well before what the officials imagine, and this worries him: “sooner or later, they will return to the starting box.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
“People who buy condominiums in these buildings will be largely Whites who will rush the closure of all churches, because they are unlikely to become members,” he said.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin 10 years later.
The initial White Methodist Congregation abandoned the places in the 1930s.
A black congregation, preaching in the vicinity, took possession of the building.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by a black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, in which Blacks could be employed or promoted.
In 1939, a fire broke out in the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and command a new carillon.
Father Johnson’s son and successor to St. Martin’s Church, Rev. David Johnson, proudly called the “poor people’s bells.”
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave her a completely different name: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
It also mentions that it is the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather states that Saint Martin has not replaced him.
Over the past few months, there has been a lot of questioning about the resettlement of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the secular elite of the church on one side, and the bishop's diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body made up of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the diocese wanted to impose the costs incurred on it, although it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners lamented the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13-year-old teenager injured by shark during a game of homard fishing
According to authorities, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while fishing in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, the San Diego TV channel, that he had been diving with friends since half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and started paying up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the young boy was screaming joy to have had a seizure, and then he realized that in reality he
had been bitten.
As he approached the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicule.
“I was yelling for everyone to get out of the water: There’s a shark,” Chad explains.
The boy was evacuated to the Radi Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The species of the shark at the origin of the attack is not known.
At a news conference, rescue chief Larry Giles reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the torso.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's Offensive Plans in the British Aesthetics Market
Sainsbury's makes a low hand on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and fills them with rays similar to those of the supermarket, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK aesthetics market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home items are falling, more extensive rays of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores and others will be applied to the experience.
Supermarkets are now investing in the beauty market in order to reuse the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's said it would increase the volume of its offerings to 3,000 cosmetics, which will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also relaunches its Make-up Store line to offer a majority of non-tested products on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, fragrance shop will test concessions in two stores in Sainsbury's, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second of which is scheduled to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarket leaders need to dig their heads to attract consumers, who are increasingly inclined to make their purchases online and head to nearby grocery stores for daily food.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the retail outlets will increasingly resemble large surfaces as the supermarket chain tries to counter discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos retail outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has enabled to drive sales of current consumer goods and profitable acquisitions.
Previous attempts to restructure the rays of pharmaceutical and cosmetic articles in the UK chain had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended with a controversy over the distribution of profits from pharmacies in supermarkets.
After selling its 281 pharmacy 3 years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-end skin care brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty products rays has been changed to improve the framework for customers.
“We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer advised advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the embellishment of our rays and the ideal location of our facilities, our dominance in the cosmetic market is now undeniable and changes purchasing habits,” added Mills-Hicks.
Wrath of Peter Jones after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragon's Den TV star Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of animator Holly Willoughby from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract related to her home decor brand, to dedicate to her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to take care of the brand of interior decoration and accessories Truly.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old animator of This Morning announced on Instagram that she would retire.
Holly Willoughby made Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den, angry, retiring from their fruitful textile and interior decoration activity at the last minute, to dedicate itself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was angry when the television's sweetheart revealed at a tense meeting at the headquarters of the Dragon's Den commercial empire in Marlow (Buckinghamshire) that his new contracts, worth 1.5 million pounds, were no longer allowing him to make money.
The True brand was similar to that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the animator’s estimated fortune at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving True, Jones jumped into her private jet to join one of her secondary residences outside Britain.
According to a source, “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It is important to ensure its future over the next two decades.
His decision left everyone without a voice.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s headquarters is filled with products ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning’s animator, which is among Britain’s most “bankable” celebrities, could cause the company to lose millions, due to significant investments in products ranging from pillows or candles, to clothes or underwear, and the risk of re-entry.
In addition, this could put an end to a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the band as president in March of the same year.
The couple went on vacation together and Peter Jones holds 40% of the shares in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business.
The debate was tumultuous, but in the end we loved each other.
Trump has mocked the media who criticized him for commenting that some consider “unworthy of a president,” and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump give up so much?”
He laughed, taking a voice from a TV reporter.
“I didn’t give up at all.”
He said Kim Jong-un was in favour of holding a second meeting after Trump called the first one, which took place in Singapore in June, a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that there was no “corresponding” US response to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure exerted.
In his rally speech, Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
“It’s all right with North Korea,” the US president said.
We have fought the armed conflict.
“Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages, and the remains of U.S. military returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this crack-filled arena, there are hardly more than 200 standing in front of me," he said, pointing his finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, the assistance of foreign NGOs was not supposed to be needed.
More than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok found themselves sparse, but no state of national disaster has been decreed, a condition required for the triggering of international aid.
“Unfortunately, many times they have clearly stated that they did not want international help, which makes things a little complicated,” said Sumung.
While Save the Children set up a team to travel to Palu, it still does not know whether field work will be allowed.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant shocks, the country is cruelly lacking the means to protect itself from the caprices of nature.
Refugees have been set up in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastal areas.
Although a warning has been issued, no alarm sirens have stopped Palu, which may have contributed to human losses.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not an easy thing.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to care for the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the site of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has placed infrastructure reform at the centre of his election campaign and has spent considerable sums on restoring roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, undermined Mr. Joko's government, calling for a representation in front of voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the persistence of interethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians lost their lives and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes, on the background of street clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge wins the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge spared a Liverpool Premier League defeat against Chelsea, marking the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge (London) on Saturday.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goals, and his team was led from 1 to 0.
He shot the ball on his left, before escaping a shot towards the second pole.
The balloon flies above the repair surface before heading to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reached Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended its way to the bottom of the cage.
“I was just trying to make myself happy, take the ball, but players like Shaq are always shooting as far away as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching to control and without really thinking a lot I decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half-time after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker made a pass towards Mateo Kovacic, before sprinting towards the middle of the field and sprinting alongside Liverpool.
Kovacic realized a quick-and-coming in the middle of the field,
Then he made a magnificent deep shot that led Hazard to the surface.
Hazard crossed the defense and finished his race in the second pole net, with a left foot shot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitans in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia: Tsunami death toll rises to 832
The disaster management agency said Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami records 832 deaths.
Many residents are trapped under the debris of buildings destroyed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 that shook the country on Friday and triggered waves of 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho spokesman told a news conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was packed with debris from demolished buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Pushing a Woman
A murder investigation was opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.
At 7:55 p.m., a 44-year-old woman with knives was discovered in John de Grayson Mews Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police are urging residents of the neighborhood who have seen or heard something to deliver their testimony.
Police captain Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is just beginning, but I would like to ask anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who would have seen or heard anything suspicious of contacting us.
In particular, I call on taxi drivers, who could have captured something on their dashcam and ask them to provide us with all the crucial information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property in which she lived.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman showed up at the scene of the crime and asked questions about where she was found.
The investigation is underway and police said they were informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver has just refused access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, the police have not allowed anyone to enter or exit the building.
The news left him without a voice.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer confided that the entire sector was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the spot,
Repeat: “It’s too horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were stationed inside the rope, and another outside.
Several officers were monitoring the building on the inside of the cord.
Anyone with any information is asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Failure Crime Agency anonymously at 0800 555 111, according to Registry 247 dated 30 September.
Parliament: Cromwell's statue, the last victim of a rewriting attempt in history
Its prohibition would be the just return of things, given the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural property in England, committed by its Puritans, such as the fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society deemed Mr. Crick’s proposal “unreasonable” and called it a “revisionist attempt.”
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, states that, "Given the current debate on the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's statues erected in front of the Westminster Palace would not be spared.
Cromwell did not command or lead iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The superb representation of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration that was given to him in the 19th century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, I mean monarchy of course.
Whether or not this representation is accurate is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents a side of the fracture.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve to be emphasized and remembered.”
China: A pig kills a breeder
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeast China.
Identified as Mr, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery cut and covered with blood near a pork market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post said on Sunday.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject pork vaccines into a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had travelled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday, with the aim of selling 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the nearby pork shop was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood was flowing from his mouth.
A medical-legal report confirms that the 250 kg animal mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the breeder’s cousin, said that “his legs were scrambled and covered with blood.”
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig at the time of Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to the breeder or his cousin.
A market official told Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid any other incident and allow police officers to collect evidence.
The family of breeder Mr. Yuan and market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks on people have already been reported.
In 2016, in a Massachusetts farm, a pig attacked a woman and her husband, seriously injuring the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 295-pound pig caught a Welsh breeder on his tractor before his wife managed to get him away from it.
In 2012, while an Oregon breeder had just been devoured by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer claims to CBC News that it is not an aggressive animal in principle, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
“They’re animals rather players.
Very curious boys... they have no intention of doing any harm.
It is enough to show them the respect they owe," he said.
Hurricane Rosa remains are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeast of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves above the colder waters of the northeastern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will lead to falls in northeastern Mexico and southwestern United States over the coming days.
Winds have blown at 135 km/h (category 1) since 5 a.m., East time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form above the Pacific Ocean and circulates eastward, towards the western coast of the United States. As it approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday in the form of a storm, Hurricane Rosa will result in tropical rainstorms and tropical rainstorms.
There will be up to 25 cm of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rainfall in the Southwest over the coming days.
At the local level, precipitation of between 2.5 and 10 cm will result in sudden hazardous crusts, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
The slopes will reach a rhythm of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in southwestern regions, including much of Arizona.
Distributed tropical rains may lead to sudden flooding and a rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into unquenchable rivers and storms will produce windstorms and dust storms in places.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local rainfall in some southern regions of the country, on the California coast.
Rainfall totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could lead to low debris spills and make the heat slippery.
It could be the first rains of the dry season of the region.
Dispersed tropical slopes will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, then intensify later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will fall across the country on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature variations are expected for the month of October across the United States due to the Arctic cooling, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will undergo significant temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example of this.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, a persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
A large part of the center and east of the United States is expected to experience a warm early October, with temperatures rotating around 26 degrees Celsius covering the plains of the south and other areas of the northeast.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above seasonal average.
Forecasts for several days indicate that temperatures should be above average in the eastern United States during the first fifteen of October.
Brett Kavanaugh’s trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on six television channels on Thursday, the captivating hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
As the political unrest continues, the broadcasters have interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a theatrical blow: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
In front of the Senate Judicial Commission, Christine Ford said she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had given up on her person and tried to take off her clothes during a high school evening.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate sketch, also claimed to be 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial is likely to have reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
By comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose animators largely supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was the most watched channel on the day of the hearings, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC ranked second with an audience of 3.26 million.
CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still according to Nielsen.
The interest did not weaken once the hearing was completed.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was played on Friday.
After the Republican's moderate office released a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator is taken to the side by protesters while trying to take the elevator to the hearing of the court.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the interview sequence live.
“Don’t look elsewhere, look at me,” one of the women said.
“Do you really believe he’s telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are in need.”
Before the elevator doors were closed, Flake indicated that his office had issued a statement and would say more about it during the committee session.
All cable and broadcast networks covered the live session a few hours later, as the Judicial Commission was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance Kavanaugh's appointment by the Senate as a whole.
Flake said, however, that a one-week investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on the allegations made against the candidate, which were claimed by minority Democrats.
Flake allowed himself to be partly convincing by discussing with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after meeting with Coons and several other senators later.
His choice was heavy on the balance sheet, as Republicans would not have obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate charges of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh.
UK: May Accuses Brexit Opponents of Making “Small Politics”
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of his plan to leave the European Union, to do “small politics” to the detriment of Britain’s future and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May in cover, its former foreign minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks against his so-called Chequers plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "cleanly rile".
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that led to the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was also decapitated and charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police service said.
Authorities have released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found on the scenes of the crime, the glasses wore Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police being responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at <0x24>350,000.
The office of the Legislative Doctor of the parish of Baton-Rouge published a preliminary report Friday, which determined that the death was caused by an injury by a bullet that crossed the head and settled in the neck.
The police service recognizes the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the state police medical-legal lab, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU’s sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked the law enforcement for their “commitment and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per game during the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "destroyed and shocked" after the news of Wayde's death.
“We’re constantly fighting this kind of event,” Wade regretted.
Mexico: a volcano crawls from the ashes
The ash evading the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern parts of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre recommended that Mexicans stay away from the volcano after recording a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center monitored several tremors and earthquakes from Popocatepetl.
On social media, images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 km from the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck downtown Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, nicknamed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists on the occasion of the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independent protesters and anti-smoke police, as thousands of protesters joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being kicked back by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colorful powder into them, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not displace tourists.
Warm-ups also erupted later in the day, while police used mattresses to contain the clashes.
For several hours, groups in favor of independence who were chanting “do not forget, do not forgive” faced unionist supporters shouting “long life to Spain”.
14 protesters with minor injuries were treated, according to the local press.
A year after the October 1 referendum, considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans pro-separation, tensions remain vivid in the independent region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite low participation rates, with opposition to the secession largely boycotting the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
It was still the same place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hopes for Catalonia's independence.
“We witnessed a great time last year.
“My parents were crying with joy about being able to vote, but now we’re in a mess,” he said.
Despite their capital victory, albeit thin, in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independentist parties have struggled to maintain the momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained while waiting to be judged for organizing the referendum and declaring the Candida defensive.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the police support demonstration on his phone, says politicians are responsible for blocking the situation on one side and on the other.
“The tension is just rising,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the 9 Catalan leaders in prison awaiting a trial since last year, announced his intention to present his candidacy for the European Parliament elections next year.
“This is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression sparked by the Spanish government,” he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men hit a house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, have been arrested after having repeatedly dug a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Police captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car also received arrow shots.
Livingston wins the 1-0 match against the Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal ensures Livingston's victory
Recently ranked, Livingston's team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 games to Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place in 2nd place in the ranking, equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of victory outside the Premiership league this season, and have to face the Hearts team, which leads by 8 points on Sunday.
But before that, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapids on the occasion of the Europa League on Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, she is extending her 6-match run in the division, and her main coach Holt, who has been replacing Kenny Miller since last month, may have pretended not to have lost a single match yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity in front of crowded opponents
Holt’s team could have taken a lot of time before they scored, as their direct approach put the Rangers in difficulty.
Scott Robinson tried to pierce but remained slippery in front of the opponent's goal; followed a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a lead by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team allowed the Rangers to own the ball, knowing that it could distract them with tactical tactics.
This is where the decisive goal comes in.
The Rangers gave a frank shot and the Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson allied themselves to kick Menga, who took a touch and scored a goal from the middle of the field.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but faced an impenetrable defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half had the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
Ranger guard Allan McGregor stopped a shot from Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to play one of the Livingston's plans.
The Livingston's guard rejected all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the referee, one for the provocation of Halkett directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a handoff.
Livingston's "phenomena" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this uphill slope.
Their style and team composition have practically not changed since their return to the summit, but the merit has largely come back to Holt for motivating a team since its arrival.
It has many great players.
Captain Halkett’s defense was magnificent and beautifully organized, and Menga managed to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall breathing throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers weren’t inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they weren’t at the height of their past talent.
They missed a last chance and managed to break through the opposing side only once; this is a warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
President Erdogan's soft welcome to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, the Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to improve relations between NATO allies.
A number of issues have been addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to host him in his country.
The clash of protests reflects Erdogan’s double vision: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at around 10:15 local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, rescues arrived at the scene, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
London police said the officers were doing their best to identify the individual and prevent his or her relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been set up. It is advisable to drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 officers injured in riot
The high-security men's prison official said six prison officers had been injured in an uprising.
The uprising began at HMP Long Lartin Prison, in Worcestershire, around 9:30 local time this Sunday, but it is still out of control.
Specialized anti-smoke agents were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 detainees and confined to a prison wing.
On site, agents were treated for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison management said: “Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons; the responsible will have to respond to the police authorities and will be able to see their prolonged sentences.”
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered to be the most dangerous in the country, are imprisoned in HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the director of the prison was hospitalized following an aggression by a prisoner.
In October last year, anti-revolt agents were sent to prison to curb a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked the staff with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden crusts (which could be beneficial for drought-affected areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but that is likely to happen at the beginning of next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading towards the desert of the southwest with what is left of its energy. This region could be affected by sudden crusts.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with announcement rains starting Monday night.
The Phoenix-based national weather service said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the stage of depression or tropical storm in a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stopped 64 km from the Arizona border.
The National Hurricane Center’s latest estimates predict 5 to 10 cm of rainfall, and up to 15 cm per spot in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other southwestern desert regions including the central Rockies area and the Great Basin are expected to record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measurements up to 10 cm.
Rosa rains could be lifesaving for drought-affected regions that are not exposed to the risks of sudden crust.
Even if the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial for the southwestern region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, just over 40 percent of Arizona experienced at least one extreme drought category, the second most severe category,” says weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa begins its journey on the coast, in the peninsula of Lower California.
Already with a great power on Sunday morning and generating winds that can reach up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm encounters the cold waters of the Pacific and therefore loses its strength.
It is expected to reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some regions of Mexico, precipitation could be massive and lead to a risk of flooding.
“In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Lower California in the northwest of Sonora and will be able to reach up to 25 cm,” said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico north, with the force of a tropical storm, and will reach the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will cross Arizona and southern Utah in the evening of Tuesday.
“Flowing rains are expected in Lower California, northwest Sonora and the desert of the southwest and are the main danger,” the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in sudden potentially deadly crusts and debris flows in the arid areas, as well as landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempt to Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old boy was found pounded in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4am local time.
He's been sent to the hospital, and his condition is stable.
Police in Avon and Sommerset said they had arrested the four young people (aged 17, 18 and 20) in the night on the side of Radstock.
Police have called on people who may have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Was Victim of Democrat Evil and Anger
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had been the victim of the rage and malice of Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally rejecting the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexually assaulting her several decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people have witnessed the intelligence and courage of Kavanaugh” today.
“A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service,” he told the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he mentioned the importance of Republicans' participation in midterm elections.
“We are five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever,” he said.
“That’s why I fight on all fronts for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats were on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
The first decisive procedure vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place by Friday, according to a Republican party collaborator.
Indonesia: An earthquake and tsunami make hundreds of victims, the balance sheet continues to increase
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had died, most of them by huge waves that hit the beaches as an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu, when six-meter-high waves flooded the beach at nightfall, taking many lives and destroying everything on their way.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake preceded the tsunami.
“When the threat of the tsunami arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not flee immediately, it cost them their lives,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t happen on its own, it drove cars, pieces of wood, homes, it took everything with it,” Nugroho said, stating that the tsunami had moved in the sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing trees, he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images published by the disaster management agency show buildings and shops destroyed, deformed and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
Replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technologies (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday’s earthquake was 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies were found trapped under the debris of buildings in ruins, he added, specifying that 540 people were injured and 29 were still carried away.
Nugroho said human and material losses could be more significant on the 300km coast north of Palu, a region called Donggala, closest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were “completely paralysed” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“The situation is dramatic and could get worse,” she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not spreading information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the floor of a building screaming freneously to passers-by in the street as a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a water wall collapsed on the coast, bringing with it buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to authenticate the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general electricity failure that cut off all communications in Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began delivering aid by cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people still have a great need for food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport has reopened as part of emergency operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: Tsunami death toll has increased, more than 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
The World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely and safely in Palu, where they found shelter in shelters in the courtyard of their offices. On the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, explains Mr. Doseba.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to provide relief to the disasters, some complained that highly experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel can enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
“This disaster is still considered regional,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares that this is a national disaster, international assistance will be able to intervene, but we are still waiting.”
When the second night after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami fell on Palu, the relatives of the missing people were still hoping for a miracle.
On Saturday, a young boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman buried under the rubble for two days, near her mother’s body.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Gendon Subandono had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other of his students were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mandagi added.
“As an elder in the paragliding discipline, I have lived through my own dramas,” he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Mr. Gendon said he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages remained unanswered.
“I don’t think they’ve ever received my messages.”
At Newport on the Levee, thieves subordinate <0x24>26,750 when recharging an ATM
On Friday morning, thieves extorted <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's agent who was recharging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police service press release.
The driver of the vehicle was evacuating a distributor into the entertainment complex and preparing to feed it, Inspector Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money destined for the distributor.
Witnesses reportedly saw many suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity is asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name and becomes Ye
The rapper Kanye West is now known as Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, “formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West, who has been known as Ye for some time, used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before heading to the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
Her participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who canceled her arrival for “emotional reasons,” the creator of the show explained.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional pseudonym, this nickname also has a religious significance for West.
"I think "Ye" is the word most commonly used in the Bible, where it means "you," West explained earlier this year, evoking the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
“Then I’m you, I’m us.
I have gone from Kanye, which means “one,” to Ye – the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs made his name Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the union line and the majuscules.
In Mexico, AMLO says it will never resort to military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians, nearly fifty years after bloody retaliation by law enforcement against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco’s place that he would “never use military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire during a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people at the time student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by granting monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. is expected to double its funding in the field of artificial intelligence
As China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. is expected to double its research funding in this sector, according to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI expert who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several U.S. government actors made AI announcements, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Double funding for AI research would be a good start, because all other countries have a long way ahead of the U.S., and we are looking for the next big AI discovery,” Lee says.
Double funding could double the chances that the next key AI step comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player. He then integrated the Microsoft Reasesearch management team and became the chairman of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has already participated in technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government.
“It’s not China that suits the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited major academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that changes to immigration policies could also support U.S. AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be automatically given to AI researchers,” he said.
The State Council of China unveiled its new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China grants funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to involve industry and academia partners. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, in turn, is currently investing more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation that is working to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians take part in the referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, the inhabitants of Macedonia heard their voices during a referendum on the change of their country's name for the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a several decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked the request for accession of Macedonia to the European Union.
Greece, one of which is called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor’s name represents a right on its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would affect the ethical identity of Macedonia’s majority slave population.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote during the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts as to whether to get a minimum participation of 50% required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?”
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, it is the price to pay for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, survived by the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the edict of the European Union. This means a safer life for each of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have stated that they will follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But participation was only 16%, while it had reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which had mobilized 66% of voters registered after the election.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko participated in the referendum and voted for the name change, in order to open the vote for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepares a small stage and has seats in front of tents installed by those who boycott the referendum.
“We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter it by the big door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, accession to NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments. The unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
“I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after filing his bulletin.
He added that a “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43% of voters are planning to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organised by the Macedonian channel Telma, estimated participation at 57%.
70% of those who voted said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, 50% of the votes plus one vote are needed.
The failure of the referendum would be the first hard blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took power in May last year.
Decisive Action: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero takes a path through Brighton’s defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defenders at Manchester and won the 2-0 match at Manchester's Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
Aguero’s goal, at the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine goalkeeper received the ball in the middle of the field, at the start of the action.
He ran between three defenders of Brighton before plunging into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He circumvented one defender before evading the others close to Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English forward took advantage of it to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to trick Brighton's keeper, Mathew Ryan, with a shot from the right side of the net.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” Pep Guardiola, the team’s coach, told reporters.
"We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at this point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Skyblues the initial advantage during the Premier League game.
From the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on the Brighton field.
He sent it to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few keys before taking Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the ball into the nets just before sliding out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer Wants to Play the Trouble-Fests Against the Rockies
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the play-off race, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only in case of an eliminatory game for the Rockies, real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League’s West Division.
The Rockies took it 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still trying to secure their first division title.
"Even though this game has no problem, we want to dig the field in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and in front of a team that will probably play at the highest level I will face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce a launcher for Sunday, but would be inclined to leave room for Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th departure, will be in training Thursday and will launch on his usual rest day, Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with an average score of 2.53 points and 300 retreats on take-offs in 220 marches and two-thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation that generated his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, speaking of the importance of Republican participation in mid-term elections.
“All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It’s a major issue. I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever. That’s why I fight on all fronts for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrific, really horrific radical group, Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“You can see it over the last four days,” he added, before calling the Democrats people “rageful, evil and lying.”
He referred to the Judicial Committee of the United States Senate and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which earned him the honor of being humiliated by the public.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm expecting one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen. "
The Labour Party is no longer the large community it was.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When activists from the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs who are not welcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she raised herself against anti-Semitism.
As for me, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting announcement on Friday said: “We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive.”
That's exactly what the Friday evening general assemblies were for my eight years as a Labour Party MP.
Unfortunately, this is not the case today in many meetings, and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if ever taken into account.
It became clear that the contrary opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptance by the party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy's takeover, and colleagues with whom I thought I would share the same political vision began to expect me to turn my coat back and take positions contrary to my beliefs, whether it be with regard to national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, no matter what I was saying, there was an abusive line on social media, calling for the withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, saying that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
Moreover, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were made to me were of a political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a deferral of sexist or racist statements every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most disappointing things about current politics is the standardization of the various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party restricts itself through distrust motions and amendments to the selection rules.
I have been given a lot of advice over the past two years: lower my eyes, not expressing my ideas so strongly, and everything would be fine.
But that's not how I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because the neglect of Thatcher's government had caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a government minister or as a local councillor.
I have never concealed my political ambitions, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with current party officials.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and public services, and I don't think this is really the time to waste time and energy by debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my voters, whether they are Labourists or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will stop me from acting for the causes that I defend, which are all in your interest.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament for the Nottingham East District.
Ayr 38–17 Melrose : Ayr remains invaded
Two late attempts may have falsified the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense day of the Scottish Rugby Championship in XV.
The team now occupies the top of the ranking and becomes the only invaded team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are taken advantage of the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate him on this match.
“Until now, we have been tested, but we remain invaded, so I have to feel happy!” he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, congratulated Ayr: “Bravo to them, they were more effective than us and they took advantage of the opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for Scottish squad Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to talk about the numbers.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle time. He scored and transformed a solo trial to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
It was followed by a long wait due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a zipper. During the recapture, Ayr took the lead with a Stafford McDowall trial transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr's interim captain, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an untransformed trial of Bruce Colvine, which created a palpable tension.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tapping Climo while he didn't have the ball, since the penalty touch, MacPherson hit the back of Ayr's mall, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the rehearsal, as almost every time since the rehearsal, after Kyle Rowe assembled David Armstrong's box kick and sent back back Gregor Henry for the team's fifth home rehearsal.
Still Game Star Launches in Restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, has decided to pursue a career in the restaurant, and the actor has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's famous show, which he writes and co-animates with his longtime on-stage partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series to arrive will be the finale of the show. And Kiernan seems to be preparing for the after-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the “blooming restoration environment” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patroll in an armored boat in the naval headquarters of La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following motto: “The sea is right back to us.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout the blockade of Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still well present, just as the desire to navigate the Pacific once again.
Bolivia has been waiting for a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be rendered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has a will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large screen throughout the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide in favour of the Bolivian application. Bolivia wants, after decades of sporadical negotiations, Chile to be required to negotiate the Bologna agreement to the end of the year.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year), also has a lot to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
“We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he said in late August.
But some analysts think that there is little chance that the court will act in favor of Chile, and that little will change, even in case of a positive decision.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant Chilean territory, and stipulated that it would not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice renders its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case was “not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favoring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may even have hurt him.
“The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ war-torn rhetoric has undermined all the goodwill that remained in Chile, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very difficult to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was abnormally fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also contested the fact that Morales - who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents - used the maritime problem as a political slogan.
“Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The Court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we must defy the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister, said his country would not deter itself from its nuclear weapons until it had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to relaunch nuclear diplomacy in the impasse more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, the current leader of North Korea.
Mr Ri said it was “chemical” to think that keeping the U.S. sanctions and opposition to a declaration that would put an end to the Korean war would fold the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement in the absence of any prior significant disarmament measures on the part of Pyongyang.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But the seriousness of Pyongyang’s renouncement of an arsenal that the country sees as the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows unveil the latest trends in covers, perhaps soon available in your stores
If you want to add XXL parts to your hat collection or to protect yourself from the sun 100%, look no further.
The creators Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of oversized hats at a PE19 parade that honoured the style of Fashion Week in Paris.
More extravagant hats each other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to incorporate their delirium pieces into the parades.
Valentino’s lighthouse was an eccentric beige hat adorned with a large edge evoking a feather, which engulfed the models’ heads.
Other oversize accessories included jewelry paired pasta, a witch hat and even an ananas. But these pieces were not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had their lips sewn and evoked Hannibal Lecter more than the High-Seam.
One creation resembled a diving gear, with tuba and glasses, while another was thinking of a melted ice cone.
And if you follow the trends of fashion, then you are lucky.
According to style observers, the imposing hats could come up to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow the footsteps of the “Bomba”, the large-board straw hat that stars tear apart, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that sells this hard-to-wear hat that flooded social media presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the swimsuit model that wore it.
The burnt orange rafia bag, decorated with rafia stripes and a handful of white leather, was the masterpiece of the PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus parade at Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in stores for next summer. The creator has so marked the minds that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills are Essential for the Citizens of the World
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of school excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to offer the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made curriculum, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart.”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and establish trust with residents of other countries.
If you look at the excellent results of the exams this year, you will find that the languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest score, A.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, shows that 72% of students have the highest score, A, in Mandarin, as well as 72% of students who have studied German, 69% of students who have studied French and 63% of students who have studied French.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Now, languages as subjects are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that among the difficulties employers face in recruiting candidates, 17% are linked to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
No matter his or her career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future thanks to this lasting skill.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults living in the UK, 75% of them did not speak a foreign language enough to have a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those in emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important to the UK in the 2020 outlook, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s preferences, several languages will be accessible in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds for them.
It is clear that today, in a global business environment, languages remain of crucial importance for the future of the country, which must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make its debut with the Lakers on Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans awaiting the debut of LeBron James at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday, in the opening pre-season, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We still don’t know how many minutes he will play.
"More than one, less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a limited few minutes.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready.”
Trump Campaign in West Virginia (Youtube Channel)
President Donald Trump is launching a series of campaign meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other scales, particularly in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
The confirmation vote for the vacancy to the Supreme Court has been postponed, with Trump seeking support for upcoming midterm elections and preventing Republicans from losing control of Congress during the November vote.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 (Eastern Time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the issue of the hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, that took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate is expected to be postponed to a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily aimed at helping Republicans gain ground for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the U.S. president said in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is such an essential element of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the beginning of this campaign,” a Trump team spokesman told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, this evening’s meeting, scheduled at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media.”
It will be Trump’s second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is at the forefront of the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try and relaunch him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political science specialist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team is ready to fight to keep hope close to Sunday's singles
After three simple, Saturday afternoon forks could well represent what was missing in this Ryder Cup.
The balancer movement of the momentum is an invented sporting concept of all coins but that players sincerely believe, and more than ever in tournaments like this one.
So where would they put the momentum, now?
“They were driving with six points ahead and now four, so it gives us a bit of wings,” said Jordan Spieth as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have the feeling of having a little wind in the doll and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and can pretend to have each scored three out of four points.
Spieth proved terribly effective from green tea and gives the example.
The screams of energetic joy intensified as his game progressed. A crucial putt allowed him to equate to the fourth part while Thomas and him were led down two after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the match at the 15th hole, raised a similar scream, from those who tell you that he believes the American team is still in line.
“We really need to stay determined and focus on his game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for each of these players right now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as evidenced by the history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four matches out of four and has no right to error.
Not only “Moliwood” were the only ones not performing a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped there Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd deliriously designates them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to delight a potential European victory as the sun sets on the National Golf.
Preferably, both at the same time with different holes.
But talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, as he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine hits sent the Spaniard and the Swedish into a hole they could never get out of.
On Sunday, no one is here to help you.
The forks and forks are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and those they don’t give, and how a strategy can swing at a glance.
Europe has played better as a team so far and made considerable progress over the last day, but this foursome session has also proven that the Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially in the country.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a solid advantage in the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning it 10-6 against the United States at Saturday's fourballs and fours.
The duo inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories on a distressed Tiger Woods, allowing them to score four points so far.
Well-determined to retain the title she had lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn’s European team made a difference by imposing 3-1 in the morning fourballs, against a messy U.S. team.
The U.S. showed greater resistance in the foursomes and won two victories, but they failed to absorb the gap.
Jim Furyk’s men must imperatively score eight points on 12 Sundays in singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to score four points in a row, while Molinari and him, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a failed weekend, are only the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup to score four points in their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed during the fourballs, they beat the pair made up of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled during the two games on Saturday, sparkled a few times, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning fourballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning the 2-to-1 win against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and three in the world rankings.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the southwest of Paris, under a fresh but free time.
The three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, losing the first two holes.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point singles gap, although Furyk's team, who held the crown, had only to make a null match to keep his trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they may not recover from a Sunday counterattack.
North Korea says disarmament will in no way be unilaterally unreliable.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions would strengthen its distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for its country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
At the World Organization’s Annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken “important goodwill measures” last year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and non-proliferating technology.
“However, we don’t see any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
“In the absence of trust in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, under similar circumstances, it is excluded that we should be the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
While reiterating North Korea's well-known allegations of Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps gradually, its statement proved important in the fact that it would not reject the unilateralization.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, held on June 12 in Singapore at the very first summit between a U.S. president in office and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work in favor of a “denuclearization of the North Korean peninsula to ensure that the North Korean peninsula is safe.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected demands to soften severe international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists that North Korea proceeds with denuclearization first and accentuates the pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even opposing the “declaration of end of war.”
“Those who think that these sanctions can make us rain don’t know us.
The problem is that keeping the sanctions increases our distrust.”
Ri made no comments on the second summit between Kim and Trump, which was stressed before the United Nations by the U.S. leader earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the part concerned with the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization would be a non-nuclearization of the pein.”
Despite all this, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s, when he said before the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles on North American territory after the “malicious” President Trump called him “man” Kim.
Trump, who had threatened the United Nations last year to “completely destroy” North Korea, did not pay tribute this year to Kim’s courage to implement disarmament measures, but added that there would still be a lot to be done and that sanctions would not be so decreasing from North Korea.
Trump said on Wednesday that no deadline had been set, “it can take two years, three years, or five months; it doesn’t matter,” he said.
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, said last Thursday to the United Nations Security Council: “The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until total, definitive and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to suppress the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already traveled to North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang, claiming that progress had been made but, in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced its “gangster methods”.
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took “equivalent measures”.
According to the South Korean president, Kim demands the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students Take Rest Courses
This year, Harvard University has set up a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fight against the growing male tendency to study by consuming caffeine throughout the night.
A professor noted that most students at the world’s best university don’t know how to take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of its kind in the United States.
After giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning, the idea came to her.
At the end of the day, a student approached me and said, "Why did they tell me that only last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
Dispensed for the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general manager of the university’s health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course hours consist of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, baskets, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their performance and importance.
In another section, participants learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
However, in our opinion, they have the right to know this information – in the same way that you have the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are,” Professor Ceisler added.
According to him, the culture of pride of “sleeping a white night” still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students make sleep deprivation a growing problem.
The fact of having adequate and good quality sleep should be the students’ “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in the mode of re-ending, infatuating them.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Ceisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and had pushed him to insist that it be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to propose to all undergraduate students to follow a similar curriculum before joining the renowned institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students provide an alarm for both sleep and wake-up time, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause disturbances to occur.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal to defeat Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another hard blow outside, Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team hoped to record their first win on the move since their triumphant 4-1 in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team at the derive, eight points behind the Premier Heards.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-time and the Rangers, short-inspiring, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston takes third place, just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, since referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after throwing an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, in turn, chose the same Livi 11 who pulled a point at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team suffocating his opponents every round.
The Rangers may have mastered possession of the ball, but Livingston has done more.
They should have scored at two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder left his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then shot Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate defender Alan Lithgow was only able to reach the second pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought that he should have benefited from a penalty after the free kick when Steven Lawless and him collided, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's requests.
The Rangers enjoyed only two shots in the first period, but the former Ibrox guard, Liam Kelly, was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a stroke of Ovie Ejaria.
If Livi's score opening in the 34th minute was against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs’s stopped footstep.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball back to Scott Robinson, who kept his blood-cool to choose Menga for an end in simplicity.
Gerrard reacted mid-time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange barely had an immediate impact when the waiter appeared in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken advantage in the last moments, but McGregor managed to push Jacobs off before Lithgow passed away.
Ranger's replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored it again.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page of our Almanach “Sunday Morning”: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE COMPTEUR TOURNE... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as the Geiger meter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man asked, “What is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger meter, it’s used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Thanks to these headphones, you can really hear the effects of atoms released into the minerals by radioactivity.”
Evans: “So tell me, it’s definitely jumping over there!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears its name remains.
New Cancer Vaccine Allows Immune System to “Detecte” Cancer Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Allows Immune System to “Discover” Cancer Cells and Kill them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine shows the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in a laboratory.
They can then “detect” a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to learn from the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory, so that they can detect the HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
According to Professor Berzofsky, the protein HER2 "causes an increase in several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immune cells to “learn” them to target cancer cells, has proven itself in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Haired with a MAGA hat, Kanye West jumped into a Pro-Trump diatribe after his transition to the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West hurled himself on the plateau after an unprecedented performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump during a Saturday Night Live and announced he was going to run for the 2020 election.
After his third piece, Ghost Town, which he sang in a Make America Great Again hat, West took over the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Sometimes I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump, he’s racist!’”
“Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's diatribe recording was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don’t know if Rock was going to joke about West with this publication.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a poor quarter of an hour behind the scenes because of his hat.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with this hat on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I’m in a hurry,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "You want to see him, the squirrel?" and said that he would wear his superman cape, because no one can dictate his actions to him.
Try the love.”
His comments attracted at least twice as much hugs from the public and members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, reports Variety. A person on the spot told the magazine: “A silence of death has fallen on the entire plateau.”
West had been summoned to replace at the last minute singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West has distracted a lot of people by singing the song I Love It in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received the support of TPUSA Conservative Group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the most courageous minds: THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE FOUND."
But Karen Hunter, the show’s animator, tweeted that West was simply “faithful to himself, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and pours out a bad ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now “officially known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course the legendary fire Prince, who changed his name to symbol, then the artist's formerly known as Prince.
Belfast: Indictment for attempted murder after white-armed aggression in restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The prosecutors will be examined by the public ministry.
Kit Harington, star of the Game of Thrones series, takes on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the finest blade, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's fantasy medieval violent series.
But the 31-year-old actor took it to the stereotype of the macho hero, claiming that this kind of screen role often leads young boys to make themselves hard to cook to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that according to him “something is wrong” and addresses the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of <0x23>MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old co-founder of Game of Thrones, admitted that he was “firmly” to tackle this issue.
“Personally, I deeply think that we have undermined masculinity.”
“What lessons have we learned from young men who become adults, in relation to the problem that is now emerging?”
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued, “What behavior is innate, what behavior has been inculcated?
What do television and the street teach young boys that they think they have to behave like this in order to be a man?
I think this is really one of the fundamental questions of our time – how can we change that?
There’s obviously something that’s ringing.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make pronouns or sequels when the series ends next summer, claiming to have ended with “the battlefields and the horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will be the star of a remake of True West, by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was for him the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, in Leslie's family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported during the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients were infected during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly to some parts of the country as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been virtually reduced to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from one year to the next, the number of people with HIV/AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, the transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90 percent of gay men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has promised, since 2003, universal access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee has disclosed senators data, and denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”.
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team had posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages dedicated to lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said these statements were supported by “extreme right-wing” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and even infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The disclosure appeared to include addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The evacuation occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations, is under no circumstances responsible for the leak of that information.”
“This false allegation is completely false and a true lie.”
Waters’ statement promptly sparked online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary.
“This denial is anger,” he wrote.
“This indicates that she does not have the temperament necessary to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It must not be provocative.
It must not question the defendant's motives.
It must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters' seat in midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s huge,” he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “authorities and law enforcement services” about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the culprits are uncovered, and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English has hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, subdued spy
It has now become a tradition of looking for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and it seems to apply to this reprise of Johnny English action comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-assessment on the question of the obviousness of our insignificance represent the new export opportunity for our country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with eye-catching eyes and rubber face, saw his license renewed for the second time in a confusing context - this name indicates above all that it is a great comedy creation designed for a non-English-speaking cinematic audience.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts at glamorous charm, has a little Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr Bean, and a good dose of the guy who runs a small note in The Fire Carts at the 2012 Opening Ceremony of the London Games.
Originally, he is also inspired by the traveler and the man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard television commercials, now forgotten, leaving the chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two friendly moments.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armor and the rotor's balls briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses such as 007 and Mission Impossible compose themselves confidently with the comedy.
The humor seems more child-oriented than adult-oriented and, to me, Johnny English’s fartless misadventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson’s silent film gags in Bean’s character.
The continuously current premise is that the UK has serious problems.
A computer pirate infiltrated the super-secret web of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great unfolding of the agents in service - a unfortunately low-level role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflow for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the verge of the crisis and who already suffers from political impopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there’s not much to put under the hood.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that if every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of retirement.
This means that you have to disturb Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic establishment as a schoolmaster, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: a few beautiful farces here, as English offers a Rock Academy way of espionage.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency information meeting and finds Bough, his former long-haul partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who create great trouble in His Majesty's secret services, go back to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful deadly woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of the billionaire technology charismatic who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough throw out their odyssey of far-reaching jokes: under the disguise of servers, they set fire to a sparkling French restaurant; they create chaos by sneezing on Volta's luxurious sailboat; and English sparks a real anarchy when he tries it, but with a casket of virtue.
All stops are ensured for this last sequence, but after all, there are not a lot of things for the kids in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn’t stop thinking, as with the other Johnny English films: Can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party denies having developed a plan for the British to work for four days but be paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn must examine a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week – but be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an additional day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while continuing to hit the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to guide the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day week was approved by the trade union congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source within the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.”
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the workers as well as with its global industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not a policy of the party and is not envisaged by it.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to give details of his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell has stated that he is determined to take power back from “anonymous administrators” and “profiters” in public utility companies.
The deputy chancellor's plans also provide that current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full setup as the Labour government could operate "deductions" due to alleged driving discrepancies.
It also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into the boards of directors of companies as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will contribute 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, which will employ up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 of dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are counting on “60 Minutes” if the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their minds.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court was postponed for at least a week following the FBI's investigation into the charges against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, Scott Pelley, the 60 Minutes correspondent, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy proved to be more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” said Kennedy.
“As I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, “Did you do that?”
It was resolved, determined, undoubtedly.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be engraved in the stone.
“I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an explosive charge,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has categorically denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people she named couldn’t verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I don’t see anything new that changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive palm tree and invested in an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people join the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only benefit from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the festival, which is to end the former Great Lawn.
The Global Citizen Festival, which premiered in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you’re ready to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to perform a number of tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteering, send an email to a world leader, call or make any other useful effort to raise awareness against the public.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuade them to call for action, or is it just another example of “clictivism” – a situation in which people really think to make a difference by signing a petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped inspire global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies of more than <0x24>37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements from its shares, of which a <0x24>10 billion segment has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and executives who are committed to “helping children to develop their full potential,” while promising Rwanda a <0xC2><0xA3>35 million aid to end malnutrition.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition a bottom-up note in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a 2018 London concert.
The group also said that following the undertaking of more than 5,000 actions to ask the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children as part of nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, “What makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen said: “The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the great civil rights movements and the fight against apartheid before us, we will achieve it, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists to perform in New York this year, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
U.S. may appeal to Navy to create a "block" to deter Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
To prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" use the U.S. Navy, said Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, quoted Washington Examiner as saying.
Zinke said Russia's presence in Syria - especially where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext that allows it to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East for the purpose of negotiating energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern center of Europe,” he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
“The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, make obstructions to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market,” he added.
Zinke addressed the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the “power consumer spokesperson” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are actually identical.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia, saying that it has “more than one rope to its arc” with a fuel-dependent economy.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has committed to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step out of the “inappropriate” project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a September speech in Moscow following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said “I believe we share this view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to use their power.”
The position of the United States has sparked negative reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to engage in European energy policy or in the bilateral agreements concluded between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for the 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider running for presidential elections following the midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider presenting herself.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider submitting my presidential nomination.”
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public gathering, stating that he was “guiding this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Obviously we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not believe that it should be presented in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University and Boston Globe Political Research Center, 58% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator was not supposed to be present.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supported, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other names of Democrats highly cited for a potential 2020 campaign include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin evokes Track Palin’s PTSD during Donald Trump’s rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his September enrollment.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
“What my own son is experiencing right now, how he feels when he comes home, I can link him to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the public at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as a “tabous subject” and said about his son and other former fighters that “they return a little different, hardened, wondering whether we respect what their comrades and air force members, and each other military, have given to the country.”
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police service, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with sexual assault and violence against a woman, which interferes with a relationship of conjugal violence and possession of a drunken weapon.
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial dispute over the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial dispute over the new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing a gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives from 18 states and districts filed a memorandum in favor of an asylum seeker who contested this policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions case opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and her sons, members of violent gangs,” had attacked her, but U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The Grace-supporting prosecutors described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generated a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang-related problems and conjugal violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy cancelled a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeal Board, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing conjugal violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” said the Amicus curiae in his memoir.
Lawyers have also argued that the policy of refusal of entry of immigrants is damaging the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary work.”
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing marital violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to people who leave their home country because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in a statement.
“Asylum has never been designed to mitigate all the problems — even the most serious — that people face every day around the world.”
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while double the number of deaths in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
“I feel very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old family mother, comforting her feverish little boy in Palu, in an empty city evacuation center.
“At any moment, an ambulance brings the bodies back.
“Clean water is rare.”
Residents were seen going to their destroyed homes, picking up stolen property, and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were submerged.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the back and shoulders, rested in front of the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to persistent strong replications.
Tears filled his eyes when he told how he had felt the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but after the silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Intimidation” Through “Propaganda Advertising”
A week after a Chinese official newspaper posted a four-page advertisement praising the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in a U.S. daily newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump evoked last Wednesday the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. parliamentary elections, an accusation that China refutes.
Accusing Beijing of wanting to interfere in U.S. elections, Trump pointed out what U.S. officials have said to Reuters is a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralysed in a growing trade war that has led them to impose reciprocal tariffs on their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China’s tariff measures were aimed at hitting state exporters such as Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an opinion paper published in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting paid advertising into the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
“On the other hand, at the Beijing press conference, you will find few contestant voices and you will not see the true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese can have on the disturbing Chinese economic trajectory, as the media firmly obey the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers has avoided publishing” his article, without even saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans are shifting electricians to midterm elections due to Kavanaugh’s downfall
While many senior Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in the context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that a negative reaction, particularly among women, could occur during the upcoming midterm elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely vivid, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, said “you can’t go back.”
Reeher added that he doubted that last-minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favor of an FBI investigation were enough to calm voters' anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokeswoman for the Progressive Group MoveOn, “women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November,” she said on September 28, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters chanted “November is coming!” in the Senate hall while Republicans ruling the Judiciary Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh’s appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be overestimated,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But this could be even higher, especially among suburban voters and young voters aged 18 to 29 who, even if they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court’s nominee, analysts believed that the reaction would be lively if Republicans made the confirmation advance.
According to NBC News, former president of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said earlier last week that "It has become a confusing disorder for the GOP."
“It’s not just about the vote of the committee or the final vote, or the nomination of Kavanaugh, it’s also about how Republicans handled the situation and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helped the democracies.
Following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, the Americans seem divided about the credibility of the two sides, a small majority leaning on the side of the latter.
A new YouGov survey found that 41% of respondents believed absolutely or probably Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, following the pressure of Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while in a state of drunkenness at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying in Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate would have shown him his genital parts during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a brand new company that is looking to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s free platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as those authorized to access such or such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said Inrupt was aiming to “dominated the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the launch.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “online personal data store” or DPL.
This can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library as well as other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available simultaneously on one browser.
The peculiarity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this “personal responsibility through data”.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company brings the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few contract developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
As of this week, tech developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said his team and him are not yet in talks with Facebook and Google to find out whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely blurred in an instant.
“We don’t ask them for permission.”
In an article published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that the “mission [of Inrupt] is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a First World War ecclesiastical decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England ecclesiastical to have received the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and did not know that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandchildren unveiled a commemorative stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was “brilliantly symbolic” to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s exploitation.
According to the London Gaza Strip, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal “through a very thick fog and under the violent fire of country cannons and machine guns.”
Later, he hurried on the firing line and, with the “best courage,” guided the line before jumping a campaign cannon on his own and killing three detachment soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something that I will never be, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be part of the show” and added that “the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will provide to him.”

Imagine that, you spent the whole night watching a well-filled Bellator 206, but you could not see the main event.
In San José, the event featured 13 fights, including six on the main chart, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK, on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to confront, UK viewers were sighed when the broadcast changed for Peppa Pig.
Some were dissatisfied to remain awake until the early hours of the morning especially for combat.
A Twitter supporter described the transition to children’s cartoon as “a sort of bad joke.”
Regarding the transmission, Bellator’s chief vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said that “the government regulation provides that at 6 a.m., this content was not adapted, so they had to switch to children’s shows.”
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, said they would work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about broadcasting, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it is six in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday our hour, or Monday their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program switched, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you that it won't happen next time.
We’re going to limit ourselves to five fights instead of six – as we usually do – and we’ve tried to give more for the fans and we’ve ruined everything.
This is a regrettable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Lower’ in Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality – but that insuffered him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize before going to high school that “everyone [was] not like me.”
As part of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc show presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he talked about the issue of homosexual rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to her illness.
Appearing as shipwrecked in Laverne’s first show, Daley confided that he felt “less than” all the other children growing up because “it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls.”
He said: “Already today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that gave me the power and strength needed to succeed.”
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was “something,” he continued.
The Olympic bronze double medalist is now a renowned LGBT activist and took advantage of his participation this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed himself because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and so wanted to give “hope” back to others.
The three-time world champion has said he "wasn't expecting" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you see so many things at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he says confident that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who knew the same highs and lows.
In June, they became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "his whole outlook" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, I was just thinking about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley confided that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to be in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be there anymore to be in the first row,’” he said.
“I held him by hand when he stopped breathing and it took him to stop breathing and to be dead so that I could finally recognize that he was not invincible,” he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"That's all I've dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, this inspired her first choice of song - Proud of Heather Small - that had accompanied her in preparation for the Olympics and always gave her chicken.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15, BST.
A Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup bench Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to get straight to prevent it from being an unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who participated in the bi-annual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was removed by captain Jim Furyk from Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it was so often for the United States, the five-time great champion shared his day between the role of supporting and the fine-tuning of his game at the stand in order to heal his evils.
He has never been the greatest of the managers, even at the top of his career. At 48, he is not the most suitable for the difficult Golf National, where the long rough consistently punishes the wrong kicks.
And as if the course wasn’t scary enough in itself, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faced Francesco Molinari, the winner of the British Open, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the beginning of the 12 singles games, make a good start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn’t say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a tape in my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in him.
He’s a legendary champion and he’s added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn’t see him playing two games.
I was expecting more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we should proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of Ryder Cup matches played.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never completely reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven resignations, although Furyk said his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to mock people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team room.”
“I think the younger players had the pleasure of measuring to him this week, which was fun to see.
It’s more than just playing.”
The captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows by experience that a non-negotiable advance before the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult journey.
The Danes played their first match in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but finally rose to the top of the ranking with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You don't stop reminding us that we were leading largely to Valderrama; we had a big breakthrough in Brooklyn, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won, but fairly," Bjorn said, after watching the 2018 ranking win 5-3 for both yesterday and Friday's National Golf.
The story will prove to me and to all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go to the bottom tomorrow.
Go there and do everything you need to do.
It is not finished until you have the points in the table.
We have a goal, to try to win this trophy, and that is what we need to stay focused on.
“I’ve always claimed to focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we’re very aware of what’s going on on the other side – they’re the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with his players’ performance on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow, it's just another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it will be the individual performances that will be presented and everything will go differently.
It’s great to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you’re there alone, you’re put to the test at your full capacity as a golfer.
That’s the message to pass on to the players, it’s to take the best of yourself tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to get the best out of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make sure his players get better scores individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced the two ends of the last day's rebounds, after being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing to the end of the "Miracle of Medina", where Europe took the victory.
“I remember every word,” he explains in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
“We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick departure as you saw it in Brooklyn, as you saw it in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in one direction, puts a lot of pressure on the midfield games.
We set our training up accordingly and put the guys as we thought we should, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of leading the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
“I have accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the entire course,” Bjorn said of his selections in simple terms.
Germany's new warship has been postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace aging warships dating from the Cold War, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential expenses.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of all the new Baden-Württemberg frigates, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems that occurred after delivery compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for a period of up to two years outside the attachment ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the uninterrupted delays mean that the avant-garde warships - which should allow Germany to project its overseas force - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the F125 made major titles when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of “software and hardware defects” that made the warship useless in case of deployment in combat missions.
Software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is estimated to be twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion), compared to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion at the outset.
The problems related to the new frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval strength is decreasing.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact “short of ships able to deploy”.
The officer said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were declassified but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of rats
New research carried out in a Scottish Highlands area seeks to reveal how mice use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
Researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common sopranos and sopranos as well as long-eared brown mice and Daubenton at Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property in order to track the activities of the mice throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional sound analysis will help determine the frequency of mouse whistles as well as the activities of the different species.
A map and habitat report will be prepared to draw up a detailed picture of their behaviour at the territory level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for mice and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and the best way to preserve forests for rats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, mouse populations have declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect the percussion and lead to the loss of their habitat.
Windshields and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flies and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks of pet cats.
Mouse heaters are not really blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes mouse heaters very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, percussion inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization has also established the first and only reserve of Scottish mice on the Threave site in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish mice.
David Thompson, domain manager, says the site is the ideal area for them.
“Here, in Threave, we have an ideal place for mice,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there’s still a lot to learn about mouse heaters, so the work we’re doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what mouse heaters need to thrive.”
It stresses the importance of checking the presence of rats before proceeding to the maintenance of the properties, because by destroying unwillingly a single nest of maternity, it can cause the death of 400 females and small ones, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
Mice are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their buttocks.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the head of the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our rats, and as far as many of our species are concerned, we don’t know what’s going on in their populations at the moment.”
Ronaldo refutes rape allegations while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations brought against him “false information” and claimed that people “wanted to make themselves known” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then reportedly paid her <0x24>375,000 to keep her silent about the incident, Der Spiegel said last Friday.
Addressing his 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram, hours after the allegations were circulated, 33-year-old Ronaldo called this information “false information.”
“No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false information,” the five-time Golden Balloon winner told the camera.
“They want to be a pub using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel on these allegations, which they have called “inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek reparation for “moral damages of an amount proportional to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a sequel to the Palms casino hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player’s room, where an anal rape would have occurred, according to documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him to be a “good guy” at 99% but did not know what was going on with the remaining “1%”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that these were consented.
Mayorga also claimed to have gone to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a friendly settlement because she felt “terrified by retaliation” and feared “to undergo public humiliation”.
This 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel this regulation, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of the alleged aggression, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve as part of a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: The UK "will regret forever" the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the UK’s secretary of state for Commerce, the UK “will regret it forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in automotive construction after Brexit.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis vehicles – built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
“I consider that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s director at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed their fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what automakers call risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated in “tense flow”, parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-manufactured vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there could be border disturbances that, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortages of coins.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Chequers plan aimed at future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
“We need a deal, we want the best deal that, as I said, will not only enjoy the current success, but also take this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The obvious thing, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to maintain what turned out to be an excellent supply chain set.”
If Toyota had not been able to specify for how long production would be stopped, it warned, however, that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the coordinator of the Unite factory union who has worked for 24 years in Burnaston, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never return.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
White House announces Trump and Rosenstein’s meeting could still be delayed
According to the White House announcement on Sunday, the meeting, which poses important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed by a week" as the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser in charge of investigating Russian interference in the election, the ties between Trump’s employees and Russia, and possible obstructions to justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will oust the Deputy Attorney General, and thus jeopardize Mueller’s independence, has fuelled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, on Monday, he appeared at the White House as he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then held at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not" resign Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judicial Commission hearing in which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the complaints filed against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if one more week is delayed given all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I like to keep the press informed.”
The affirmation would be contested by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conferences at the White House.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the rarity of the conferences was not due to aversion to the “demagogic” television reporters, although she said, “I have nothing against the fact that they’re packing the gallery.”
Then, she let it be understood that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without citing any evidence, she added that “the president participates in more questions-answer sessions than any other president before him”: “We checked the figures.”
There will always be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press has the chance to question directly the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
“We’re trying to do it frequently, you’ve seen it well in the last few weeks, and it’s going to be the place of a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.”
On a regular basis, Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare for a solo press conference to be held.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and sometimes a strange appearance in front of the journalists gathered.
On concerns about Brexit, the Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Health Secretary wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their country’s gratitude and wish to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish lawmaker Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of status applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, the withdrawal negotiations have continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to lead to decisions this fall.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After suffering a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
According to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee Tigers' second-in-command, was operated on an emergency after a head injury on Saturday during the Vanderbilt Commodores' 31-27 defeat.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the state of Tennessee, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the middle of the day.
“He got on the touchline and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the keyline before placing it on a cipher and taking it to another exam.
A Tennessee state representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operating room of the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said there was "no precision yet on the type or extent of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year athlete, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He scored a total of five goals on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total of the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp fees if they buy a property in the UK and additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new conservative regimes
This measure will cancel the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury is expected to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy a property in the UK - the extra money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will be used to strengthen the government's efforts in the fight to help homeless people.
This surcharge - which comes in addition to the current stamp law, including the higher levels set up two years ago on secondary residences and rental purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to collect up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13% of London’s new constructions are bought by non-residents in the UK, which raises prices and prevents first-timers from making a place in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "fantasy cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp right to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing major construction companies of keeping real estate prices at a high level by occupying land without using them, he invited Mrs. May to give up affordable housing quotas in order to settle the “real estate disaster” that is going on in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of proposals for reform in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the elimination of “innocent” expulsions.
He also wants to give the councils more powers to build new housing.
“Last year, I stated that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream – that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it is as easy for individuals who do not reside in the UK, as well as for foreign companies, to buy a house as well as for British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of accessing property has become far away and the misery of the homeless remains too real.”
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland technician Jack Ross explains that his “ultimate ambition” is to become the Scottish picker at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish takes pleasure in the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently ranks third in League 1, with three points in the lead.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I had to play for my country as a player.
I have been selected for Division B and that’s all,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
“But I grew up following Scotland’s matches at Hampden with my father and that’s something I’ve never forgotten.
This opportunity, on the other hand, would only come if I succeeded in managing the club.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland's pickers are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former technician says he hasn't hesitated to rank behind such iconic names in such a big club, having already declined Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’”
“By the structure and infrastructure of this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League,” he added.
"It's not easy to get there, but I probably wouldn't consider myself a success here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa go back from a relegation in the third division and turned St Mirren, who was on the relegation edge, into a major championship winner the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Alloa’s support “was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls.
“I really felt that being a coach was better for me than playing.
It sounds strange because I got out of it, that I gained my life well, and that I enjoyed some of the most appreciable summits.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of details to settle every week.
I continue to live this in terms of stress and stress at work, but being a coach is fine.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I’ve been in my whole adult life.”

According to a survey, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer canyon has raised the revenues of British pubs in difficulty, but has exacerbated pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that bar and pubs groups recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8.
Peter Martin, of CGA's board of directors, who compiled the data, said: "England's permanent sunshine and longer than expected participation in the World Cup made the month of July follow the model of June, where the bars had experienced a significant increase of more than 2.8% for its sub-restaurant.
The decline of 1.8% in June in the restoration sector only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are by far the most in vogue, with more points of resemblance than the restaurants down there.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurateurs.
Looks like people just want to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%.”
Paul Newman, an RSM hotel and leisure analyst, said: “These results follow the trend observed since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in terms of sales on the home market.
Not surprisingly, restoration groups continue to experience difficulties, although a 4.8% drop in annual sales on average is particularly painful, in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have been less suitable for food industry operators and the weather will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will give a well-deserved repeat.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in deployment.
Industry sales are monitored by the UK's Coffer Peach Tracker for pubs, bars and restaurants, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the industry standard.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children — some are only 11 years old — have secret social media accounts he hides from his parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake Insta” pages
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students say they have a “main” account to show to their parents
One in five children – some only 11 years old – opens a social media account that he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake Insta accounts” – a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students said they managed a “main” account cleaned to show it to their parents, while also having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site discovered a teenager who was encouraging others to “violete me.”
According to a study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of 11-18-year-olds have a double profile, with half of students admitting to having private accounts.
CSM chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s troubling that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to take advantage of his extensive experience gained internationally over the past ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys immense respect within the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would benefit enormously from its participation in the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the Olympics 200 metres and 400 metres in 1996 where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after undergoing a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had an AVC.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent.
It was a challenging job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for your message of encouragement!”
Online, a dairy farm ad that compares mothers and cows shares opinions
An online ad from a company offering a milkshake compares breastfeeding mothers to cows during trafficking.
In order to mark the launch of what is called the “world’s first silent milkshake,” Elvie, a tech company for large audiences, launched a bold advertisement inspired by a music video to showcase the freedom its new milkshake offers to nursing women.
In a herd of cows full of fodder, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose lyrics are: “Yes, I cheat myself, but you don’t see a tail” and “In case you didn’t notice, it’s my breasts, not breasts.”
The refrain continues: “Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help the women trailing the milk.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received contradictory reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a bad decision than using cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are abducted in the days following their birth,” wrote one of them.

Another commented: “It’s a trauma understandable to the mother and the baby.
“But yes, why not use them to advertise a milkshake for mothers who are keeping their baby?”
Someone else added, “An advertisement so disconnected.”
Others have defended advertising, for example a woman admitting she thought the song was “hilarating”.
“I think it’s a genius idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pomper gave me the impression of being a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun advertisement for moms who draw their milk (often in their workplace or in the toilet) and feel like “cows.”
It’s not advertising that praises the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal they have danced with the discreet milk shooters hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use milkshakes say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's milkshake is completely silent, with no wires or tubes and is discreetly inserted into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even get out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother, commented: “Elvie’s milkshake is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk pull will provide.
This is not the first time that the milker Elvie has made one of the papers.
During London fashion week, a mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have settled silently in a camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly because the Trump administration's harsh speeches and policies have made it difficult to place children in respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents themselves were paperless immigrants, and they feared that their own possibility of staying in the country would be compromised by the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their home should submit their fingerprints and that these data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had filed a request for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of the detainees did not have a legal history.
“Almost 80% of people who are respondents or family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people,” said Mr. Albence.
According to the refugee actors, in order to deal more quickly with the case of children, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court in the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than by anyone, to file their case with respect to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed not eligible will be expelled quickly.
According to speakers and reports presented in recent months by the refugee network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can result in bursts of violence or attempted escape.
In a large institution like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of its size, according to child rights defenders.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have trouble managing.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw on the ground.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they "would be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem argued that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been derailed from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to carry out this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged” of both terrorist groups and any “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of which form and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground.
Moualem said the conditions were favorable for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational concerns" that discouraged refugees from returning home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure that these returns are facilitated,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have announced that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition aimed at ending this war was concluded.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has made political negotiations progress.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale assault on the province, where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement provided for “precise deadlines” and hoped that the military measures would target jihadists, especially the fighters of the Nusra Front, who are linked to al-Qaeda and who “will be eliminated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a representative of the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the group’s work should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution,” and issued a warning against any interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Mandate
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many Liberal viewers doubtless hoped, the deportation and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
Which would be “The Most Spectacular Final of a Presidency!”
At the moment, the public does not show any signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and nearly tripled, reaching 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in high-hearing hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show, which reaches 3.5 million viewers on big nights, is the first cable TV channel.
“It’s a case that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, ABC’s “Designated Survivor” drama host, who talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an award-winning comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about slipping into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory for her.
She recalled taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was voting for Trump.
“Why?” she asked him.
“He replied, ‘Because he made me laugh,’” Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos has a playful value.
Obviously, unlike everything that happens on television, Washington’s scenarios could determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, whether immigrant families can come together and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the wealthiest viewers can afford.
And yet, this goes beyond being an informed citizen when you meet to watch for six hours a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used a “deep know-how” for his book “Fear.” they describe the Washington, the M’p’s, on the leather jacket of an ottoman’s (and the <0x24>15,000 Manalong’s Manalong’s).
I will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
“If part of what he’s doing gives the impression of watching a reality TV show, it’s because he’s getting you to swallow something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about changing teams and kickbacks from Trump.
You can't afford to miss an episode unless you're on the trail.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees home on the north bank of Kauai, but he landed inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not separate himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh preparing to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember the time when we had all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

External money invades the tightest midterm elections
It is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, thanks to a re-adjustment of congressional districts that allowed two holders to dispute the same seat.
This recently restructured suburb of Pittsburgh is the seat of Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who took his seat in another district during the special elections last spring.
Lamb is measured by another holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which strongly overrides the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race of the new 17th district gave rise to a clash regarding the funding of electoral campaigns between the major party funding branches, the Congressional Committee for Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Committee for Republican Campaign (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a just win last March during a very popular special election in the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District.
This seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district's 20-point victory.
Politologists have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. has considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, then retreated
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington little opposed.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization’s leadership.
State Department representatives have decided to summon the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against “their recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department.
But sanctions were only foreseen against El Salvador, which received US aid estimated at <0x24>140 million in 2017, including to control narcotics and provide it with development and economic support.
The envisaged sanctions, which included reductions in financial assistance and visa-targeted restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings continued, the representatives of North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts of the United States to re-immigrate.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thereby putting an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence now hears a speech at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. embassies have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new messages or severe penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three U.S. dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the cover of anonymity.
Their comments were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying the history
The next tile could be Special Advocate Robert Mueller's report on the possible obstruction to Trump's justice. The public file is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his investigation into a connivence of Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress’s control changes, Mr. Trump will be obliged to report to that body, at the time he is preparing to represent himself before voters and, perhaps, a jury composed of his peers.
There are many “if”, and I do not claim that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to organize a coup against Hitler, if only the West had held his head and pushed back the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around these clutches and the inevitable march of democracy is accelerating or delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these clivages.
What will we do if Mr. Trump resigns Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since the newspaper reported that, last year, he proposed to secretly register the president and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“What will we answer if the FBI’s recent investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial – or if he is entrusted to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will ask for an account to Mr. Trump?
If we fail these tests, democracy will pass a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my ambassador’s residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the swastika tree table.
With this heritage in legacy, I can’t be optimistic about our future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident face to face at Rapid Vienne
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive zero-match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a solid position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury deprived midfielder Graham Dorrans of his first participation of the season until the null 2:2 game against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to take the best of such a result to make profits.
“It was a positive point for us because Villarreal is a quality team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game thinking about getting something and we started with a point.
We might have been able to win it in the end, but, overall, a zero match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a bit of luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they made a good result during their last match, yet I’m sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
“Last year has been really difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a factor of satisfaction about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Let’s hope we can go ahead now, leave the last season behind and triumph.”
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear about their retirement savings
Although the participants in this survey clearly knew how they wanted to be treated, few people were discussing the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not doing what’s necessary to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide life insurance.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t communicate your wishes to them well in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a buy-back value to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your property - provided you have the means to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in the passage.
Provide a health care prosecution that will allow you to appoint a trusted person who will verify your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a prosecution regarding your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and take care of paying your bills if you are affected by incapacity.
Think of the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is going to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
“There are not only the finances at stake, but also who are the doctors,” Martin asked.
“What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Put this plan in place.”
A man has been wounded several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received several shots fired with a compressed air rifle as he returned on foot from an evening party.
The victim, aged about forty, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, at the time she was shot in her chest, stomach and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place around 2:30 p.m. BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see his aggressor.
His injuries did not threaten his life and the police called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the balance sheet is expected to increase.
As communications were paralysed, the ambulance services were unable to receive any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated following the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Donggala is a regency that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) from coasts to the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the Regency, an administrative region located below a province, was estimated at 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, and in particular of the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic fire circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on December 26 triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 off the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for marital violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for aggression.
Palin, a 29-year-old man from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, violating a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a statement released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he had picked up the phone from a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in interim detention at the Mat-Su Interim Detention Centre and is detained under <0x24>500 non-guaranteed bail, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself “innocent, it’s safe” when his advocacy was asked, the network announced.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and is fined <0x24>250,000.
He was also accused of having committed a class B minor offence, punishable by a day in prison and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged aggression.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His partner had claimed that he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD from his Iraqi service.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died as a result of the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are failing and the victims' balance sheet is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos broadcast on social media show the point of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time the tsunami broke out on the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for Person Suspected of Terrorist Attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assailant who killed eight people – a rare sentence that has not been applied in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, used a rented truck at Home Depot to attack a cycling track on the West Side Highway road in Lower Manhattan, crashing on his pedestrian road and a cyclist last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov “intentionally” murdered the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to demand the capital punishment deposited with the South District of New York.
These two allegations are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after this aggression, a large federal jury sentenced Saipov to 22 chiefs of prosecution, including eight murder charges for extortion of funds, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime and one for crimes of violence and car robbery.
The attack required “meticulous preparation and premeditation,” the prosecutors said, calling the method used by Saipov “hateful, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The South District of New York had not demanded the death penalty in prosecution for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for committing conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years following the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, originating in Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to court records.
According to police, he told investigators that he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told authorities that he was prompted to commit the attack after watching videos of Daesh on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to show Daesh’s flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 prosecutors.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “obviously disappointed” with the decision to try to prosecute.
“We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than accept his prosecution of guilt and sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of being released can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all interested parties,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had already asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today pledged to “mobilize the People’s Army” at a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former UK Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s deputies suggested, it should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said during the Birmingham march that the UK would have been "already freed" if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the dilemma that May is facing to reconcile her deeply divided troops has been highlighted by the Conservatives in favour of the idea of staying in the Union who joined an isolated protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has difficulty maintaining his Chequers compromise plan despite the threats of those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its programme and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone indicated at the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted to “get rid of Chequers.”
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and should have been entrusted with the burden of negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have already left,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: “We have not committed ourselves to world wars to subdue ourselves.
We want to make our own legislation in our own homeland.”
Mr. Bone dismissed the suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who was in favour of the exit, was also present on the march to tell reporters: “I’m just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and our activists who are sipping the streets and making us vote first.
Leave Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to Ms. May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their jobs when they honor their promises.”
“Mr Farage told the assembly that politicians should be brought to “feel the pressure” if they are about to betray the decision that was taken as part of the 2016 referendum.
“It is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
They’re trying to fool Brexit and we’re telling them today, “We’re not going to let you get out of it like this.”
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: “I wish you could feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing this country’s popular army that has allowed us to win Brexit and we will not stop until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, pro-European fans marched through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in downtown.
A small number of activists branded conservative banners against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis mocked conservatives because of security issues regarding the party's implementation at the beginning of the conference.
“They are the ones who ensure that they are able to put in place computer systems and all technology for Canada, plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a real farce.
A good Brexit doesn’t exist,” he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of presenting himself in the presidential election
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider the possibility of running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future at a public assembly in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a GOP representative in the states, who was co-chairman in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been at the center of speculation that it could face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters as part of a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she had any intention of presenting herself to the presidency.
Warren responded that the time had come “for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which implies having a woman at the head of the state.”
Arrest in the death of Sims from Louisiana State University
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death of basketball player Wayde Sims, a LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police service participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying a man who appeared on the images.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning, near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims received a bullet wound to his head and succumbed to his injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul, at 247 sports, told the media on Saturday.
Wayde took the defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Asked, Simpson admitted to having found himself on the spot, in possession of a weapon, and having shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody for the East Baton Rouge parish police service.
Sims, a 2-metre-old boy who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, 10 of which started last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton headed to the World Championships after his team’s directions allowed him to win against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team’s guidelines would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and rolled Hamilton on the side as he defended his place in the first two rounds, and invited Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to get into the torment at the tail of the peloton, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes went through the stands one lap later and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton took advantage after a wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver leave the inside at the risk of resisting after a double defensive attempt in the third lap.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while maintaining his tyres to aim for a fast arrival and advance Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally reached the standings in the 44th round, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight rounds, ranking Raikkonen fourth.
It was a hard day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team did an exceptional job to get one two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who stressed that she had not disclosed Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judicial Commission, but argued that the events taking place in the Senate showed that people were “bad, disgusting and disgusting.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that’s happening in the Senate these last few days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“Seeing the disclosures and the leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you disclose any information?
Do you remember his answer... did you disclose information - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not disclosed anything."
Well, wait a second.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information,” he added, thinking of the senator’s impression.
Feinstein received last July a letter from Ford describing in detail the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I have not concealed Dr. Ford’s allegations, I have not disclosed his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it as confidential as she asked me.”
But his denial doesn’t seem to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday night during the rally: “I’m going to tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Following his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president made it clear that Democrats were using these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the evil, the messaging, they care about who they hurt, who they have to crush in order to gain power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars cleared their Friday Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants by knocking down the 5-3 return game at Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought equality back home before Dwyer regained the advantage to the Giants.
François Bouchard scored for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, assuring them the victory.
This was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for the Adam Keefe players, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast, after being caught.
This was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants having triumphed in the last three games.
Dwyer gave the advantage in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
During a first season well-charged, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt sets out to serve Cownie at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer secured the Giants advance before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team gathered and Bouchard scored once again with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen place Dundee in the lead for the first time at the end of the second period, ensuring victory for his team by scoring a fifth goal in the midfield.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will welcome Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Aerial Traffic Controller Has Died Helping Hundreds of People Aboard an Airplane to Escape Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others have disappeared after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi Island last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the area and a large number of people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite the escape of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to give up his position in the violently shaken tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
It remained in place to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt that it was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our heart is broken to learn this,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country's disaster prevention agency indicating that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet would continue to increase as many bodies were still under the rubble and a large number could not be rescued," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves measuring up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide aid and food supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings the bodies back.
Clean water is rare.
Mini-markets are plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s military: “I urge you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?”, CNN said.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini: Air Niugini now declares that a man has disappeared after crashing an airplane in the lagoon.
The airline that handled the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims a man is missing, after 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the plane that was flown.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, she has not been able to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats participated in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the landing track.
Witnesses said the plane had crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others had been able to slip into the water until the airplane's rescue exits were flown.
He claimed that the crew were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy claimed that sailors working close to improving a quay also participated in the rescue using a pneumatic boat to transport people on land before the plane flows in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them concern Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecution postponed his case on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used phone records from a cell phone to track the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night that the latter died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several mobile phones indicating that Tellis e was meeting with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers' house while he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to Sanford to talk.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had said the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he was "[menting] because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency lies in the fact that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The phone records show that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers’ death, Tellis removed Chambers’ SMS, calls, and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is due to begin its advocacy on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held before the jury throughout the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by impregnating its music with positive messages.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims that hip hop has distanced itself from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The band wants to reconnect with its roots and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York girl sues a couple for firing her after a “racist” text
A New York girl is prosecuting a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received an error message from her mother who complained that she was “another Black.”
The couple denies being racist, and assimilates the prosecution to an “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her consternation in 2016, noting that Giselle Maurice, the new little girl, was Black on her arrival for her first day of work.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her ghetto, Plasco-Flaxman sent her back to Maurice, explaining that her ex-girlfriend, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was rather expecting a Filipina.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a working day and then sent home by an Uber.
Maurice is now prosecuting the couple in order to obtain compensation for her return and demands a compensation of <0x24>350 per day for the six-month home service for which she was initially hired, but without a contract.
“I want to make them understand, listen, we don’t do this kind of thing,” she told the Post Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to allegations of racism saying it was reasonable to end Maurice’s employment, fearing not being able to trust her after she was wronged.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone you have been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's see!"
Associating the trial with an “extortion,” Plasco claimed that his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a “very delicate situation”.
“Would you be chasing someone like that?
It’s not a very nice thing to do,” the business banker added.
While the file is still ongoing, the public opinion court has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington Publishers Fear Readers Don't Identify a Speaking Bear, Reveals New Letter
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of this letter: “It is difficult to replace someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It’s a lot of fun, knowing what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small teddy bear, would have remained optimistic about the rejection of her work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had a taste of “sweet mother” after her last year’s death.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family,” adding that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a fairly quiet man, and he wasn’t a pretentious one,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds something: we are proud of him, even if it’s not really his own realization.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed merit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
On landing, his daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn’t expect it to get out of it,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors had given her to maintain her heart rate were slowly depleting and getting out of her system.
She had died some time before and it all stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold the punch.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in grief for her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, not worrying about the test she was going through.
“No one was aware,” she said.
“I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved it.”
Women in mourning deposit postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are trying to prevent others from leaving their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted on a Welsh bridge postcards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Ms Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I’m forced to feel on a daily basis,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, living in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated any room.”
However, he left his job before dying, as he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, “I’m constantly afraid that there will be a workout effect.”
Ms. Davis created the maps “to let people know that there are people you can go see and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t shut up – you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner Mark for 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt shot, depressed or otherwise,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw his attitude changed.
It was at its lowest on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything."
She said her death was a huge trauma for them, but they must get out of it: “It’s devastating for the family.
It's destroying us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for — a limited investigation in time, limited in scope — maybe we could bring a little bit of unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee would “disintegrate” into a partisan impasse.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections will only take place in five weeks, or November 6, and if, as expected, Republicans score poorly, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush grabbed the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We still do not know if Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: Number of Deserts ‘slows’ under Kim’s leadership
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un's rise to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, said 1,127 desertions took place last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs demanded by passersby were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters will finally be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China sees deserters as clandestine migrants rather than as refugees and often repatriated them by force.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang as part of talks focused on the denuclearization negotiations that remained pending until then.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in the broad lines, to work in favor of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused U.S. sanctions of lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we should be the first to operate a unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unable to sit in the Supreme Court
Pelosi, the leader of the parliamentary minority, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unable to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments as part of an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have treated her as “hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Committee of the judiciary last Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes barely yelled and suffocated by evoking his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations of him a "grotesque and coordinated murder" organized by disappointed liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that according to her, Kavanaugh's testimony would prove that he was unable to sit in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was against the Democrats.
“I think he discredits himself with these statements and the way he treated Clinton and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to depose Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, and if Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only unable to sit in the Supreme Court, but he is also unable to sit in the court where he is currently,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi also added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh eluded the question of the possible reversal of certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and expect what we say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’” Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It’s a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger overflowing, and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, do you?”
“I was greatly helped by a woman who was in charge somewhere, who told me she was also crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she got angry and would cry, ‘You can think I’m sorry.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
And I found it brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as extortion to anger, in part because they are fundamentally incomprehensible.
One of my most remarkable memories of a first job, in a men-dominated office, where one day I found myself crying with inexpressible rage, was having been caught by the skin of my neck by an old woman - a cold-looking director who would always have me slackened.
“Don’t let them ever see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they've had you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic MP from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on her presidential election.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of presenting herself to the president.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she confided to me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the league, and the last thing they missed was someone else.
Someone had called it "Snow White and the Seven Nails."
As the campaign was very advanced, she had been delayed in fundraising, and therefore swore that she would not participate unless she raised <0x24>2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually donated <0x24>1,000 to men would only give her <0x24>250.
“Do they think I’m entitled to a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters - she was more of a sympathetic supporter than a delegate.
“You would have thought I was having a nervous depression,” Schroeder recalled about the reaction of the press to her.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my gravestone.
“Did she cry?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit in Beijing
The first deliveries of the trade war between the United States and China have been appalling, and although the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase occurred this week with new customs duties affecting US<0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), taxing half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
Each time, Beijing has responded in nature, striking recently tariffs of 5% to 10% on <0x24>60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has committed to equating the United States, and it is unlikely that the second-largest global economy will soon be hesitant.
To retreat Washington is to surrender to demands, but to surrender publicly before the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can properly play its role, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive long-term effect on China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic slowdown in one or the other countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged,” Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia, told the New Security Center’s think tank.
Syria is “prepared” for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria declares itself ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is continuing the rehabilitation of areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of this devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the United States team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States have now lost six consecutive times on European soil and have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn crossed the 14.5-point bar needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was in difficulty during most of the tournament, pushed his start in the water at the 16th hole in par-3, giving his duel to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players to have ever reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, whose first edition dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was scored 5-4 by Denmark's lowest-ranked player, Thorbjorn Olesen.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, leaned 2 and 1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the European champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today it’s louder than I am.
It was a moving year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help him,” Garcia said with emotion after the European victory.
He passes the flamingo to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the legend of American golf Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles last Sunday.
“I feel an incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has lost four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding the fairways all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're going to get together, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We need to be inclined.
We have been pushed over.”
Red tide info point: Decreasing concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report of the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in red tide concentrations in certain areas of the Tampa Bay region.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in the areas of the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - which makes fears of declining concentrations.
The red tide covers about 209 km (130 miles) of coastlines, from the north of Pinellas to the south of the counties of Lee.
There are islands about 16 km (10 miles) off Hillsborough County, but in fewer sites than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off Pinellas County have been reported last week, low to high concentrations in Hillsborough County, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations at the bottom of Sarasota County or offshore, average concentrations in the last county, and low concentrations in Charlotte County, and low concentrations in the bottom of the county.
Cases of respiratory irritation persist in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwestern Florida over the past week.
