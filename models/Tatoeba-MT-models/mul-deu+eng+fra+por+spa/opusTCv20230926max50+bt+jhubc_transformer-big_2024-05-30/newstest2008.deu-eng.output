Food owes to European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation in the euro area is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 eurozone countries, deflation was higher than expected in November – after 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, according to the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., British, and Canadian notes, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the lead interest rates. In its opinion, the interest rate cuts would favour the rise in commodity prices and the slight decline in unemployment to create a spiral of inflation.
The ECB aims to keep the inflation rate below 2 percent, or at least close to the 2 percent mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the middle of the mill: inflation needs to be “debate” to exclude the need for action at a later date.
In November, the inflation rate reached a record high of 12 years in Germany with 3.3 per cent; in Spain, the rate rose from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Food and energy prices are responsible for the rise in inflation in the eurozone.
The MATIF wheat quotations increased by 88 percent, and the price of soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant deterioration in 2007 in the case of food oils and dairy products.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year – last month the price per barrel of black gold reached almost <0x24>100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts assume a 3% inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup is facing a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers grew significantly until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the approval for the socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
The difference is evident among party-righteous voters thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two-thirds (71%) are opposed to a fifth (20%) approval for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: they account for 2% of the total population.
The number of voters in both camps has increased by 1%.
Compared to the last low point, the overall economic mood has deteriorated further – never before has the share of those who consider the country’s economic situation as “extremely bad” been so high (41 percent), while the other 46 percent consider it “very bad.”
After more hopeful outlooks in the spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth is expected to improve.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents — a historic high — judged the Prime Minister’s work as “very bad than right.”
Thirteen percent of respondents have a high level of trust or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proportion of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% mistrust the head of the Fidesz party.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who believe that the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be handled even without a change of government.
After the riots in October last year, still 35% had voted for the remainder of the government and the head of government, this share is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) only see the solution in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent responded that they were "certain" to participate, and another 20 percent would vote "probably".
By comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place on Sunday, only 55 percent would go "with certainty" to the polls, another 15 percent would consider their participation "probable". Given these trends, the result of the referendum would be predictable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% would vote against the hospital daily allowance.
Translated to the group of "certainly" voters, the shares of the opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would be even 81, 84, or 89 percent, respectively.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost one-fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörser trading area have also maintained an average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no VAT increase this year.
Articles from Daily Economy
In the Budaörser trading triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets, price increases of over HUF 1,000 have been recorded.
After prices in the food markets were "davongaloped" in December last year, the depreciation percentage has not fallen drastically, compared to the above-mentioned high level.
However, it is certainly discouraging for consumers that what they had paid well below HUF 9,000 in the past year is not even available for HUF 10,000 this year.
The price of the "Napi" basket exceeds the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets examined.
The highest price was HUF 10,573.
(In 6800 the price was 6800 HUF.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at previous year’s level, while prices for nipples, nuts and molluscs have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but there were 1kg of bread for 139 forints at Auchan.
There was no competitive price drop for the product to less than 200 forints.
Also surprising was the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola flask of under 200 forints, so the drink including flask cost only HUF 257.
Yet this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison Auchan cut the most expensive, and Cora cut the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart by 15 per cent compared to Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 per cent each.
The difference between the cheapest cart of the previous year and the most expensive of the current year was 12%, while the increase between last year’s cheapest cart and the most expensive cart of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,206.00 Forint, but the VAT increase at the prices of last Christmas was noticeable.
This is precisely the process that has made trade angry: it seems that the warehouses were not quite able to decide which price ranges to apply to the individual items, as the impact of the price increase on consumer behaviour was unpredictable.
(If the dealer plans poorly the speed of a product, he or she may fall by substantial profits in the price range, which is based on the traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, last year's "Napi" shopping basket was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forints, while the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
This year, such extremes were not observed as the most expensive basket costed 1,630.00 Forint more than the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284.00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was shown, the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets has increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office detected a more than 30% deterioration over a 12-month period.
In addition to eggs, too.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, it seems almost impossible with the latter, as the price level of the expensive product already in the previous year, even in the worst case, has risen by hardly more than 10 percent.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers - after all, they were able to roll down the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trading triangle, hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warehouses no longer look at prices.
It is purchased in large quantities, durable foods go in pallets over the store tables.
On Wednesday morning, there were endless snakes at the cash register in all three warehouses, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multis complain to opinion researchers that they could not even reach the planned turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many places are saved on disinfectants
More than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals due to inadequate treatment with antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overloading of staff - all factors that are not exactly acceptable to mitigate the infections, according to the lead doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of János Hospital, an MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but shortly afterwards the man had to return with an MRSA infection. Since then, an important operation could not be performed because of the bacterium still in the patient’s body.
By December 10, 1094 infections caused by multi-resistant agents were reported from hospitals to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the lead doctor of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Börocz.
So many infections, caused by multi-resistant agents, have been safely registered in hospitals, but the dark numbers are likely to be higher.
Approximately two-thirds of infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carries about a third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as neck inflammation, almond inflammation, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well healing.
However, if the agents are overdosed or improperly applied, antibiotic-resistant bacteria are produced, which are rapidly spreading in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently malfunctioning immune system, but also in older, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the hospital’s daily routine.
You should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA is just not there where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff wear rubber gloves and masks during care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment," - said Tibor Nyulasi.
When they are admitted to the hospital, the patients are examined for MRSA, but an infection cannot always be prevented.
Uncommon sampling
The majority of MRSA-induced infections in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for inhibiting the formation or spread of the multi-resistant agent, says Karolina Börocz.
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine the patients delivered and immediately isolate MRSA-infected patients.
However, microbiological sampling is not so often practiced in Hungarian hospitals.
Last but not least, because there are no grants for this examination from the State Health Fund.
Therefore, most cases only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, that is, microbiological examinations are necessary so that no resistance to the agent can be formed, but this directive is not always complied with by hospitals.
Among outpatients, or patients in primary care, microbiological sampling is even less common, says Karolina Börocz.
Saved with disinfectants
Scientific evidence proves that MRSA is most commonly transferred from one patient to the other by nursing staff.
This is precisely why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks, is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted through droplet infection or contact, but in domestic hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds are almost lined up, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, even in the less well-established hospitals, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that actually favor the development of infections.
Such infections are shown to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped, where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Börocz.
Government program against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections in the grip causes the health insurance huge costs, so they are combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA or its containment in the government program was retained.
After first signs, the program is successful - as evidenced by published data, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared prevention of the development of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
The police chief was not drunk.
In the case of a fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official opinion is now available.
The police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman for the Budapest Prosecutor's Office on Friday, after the official opinion was submitted to the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first inquiry, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he joined the tax.
The former chief of police, in his own car in the XXII district, entered Kossuth Lajos Street and crossed a 55-year-old man who crossed the street in an unmarked place.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mild circumstance - the steering wheel has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, rear.)
The pedestrian has suffered injuries after his hospitalization.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then resigned his duties and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Prosecutor’s Office has initiated its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the outset.
Another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
Finance Ministers János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total of EUR 400 million.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects carried out with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million loan agreement was already signed in the past, the current agreement is about the use of the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million allocated.
The amount agreed in the loan agreement of EUR 150 million is also intended to be spent on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million will be decided later on as part of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contractual partners have signed an agreement of over EUR 50 million, which will flow mainly into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the subway line 4 was also spoken.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of the subway financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The interest rates are EURIBOR-binding, the loan is made available by the EIB with a deferral of 8 years, without commission.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe looks at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys in the EU’s still cheapest market, which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most sought after patch for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with affordable ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Among the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, on the sea are Albena, the "golden coast", the "sun coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the runners, however, real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to estimates of Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria with also attracting domestic investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as Russia’s highly favourable region, more buyers are registered.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - commercial and office spaces offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, and thus to attract tourists in addition to the summer and winter seasons also in the other two seasons.
Therefore, prospective investors are already buying in great style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria also want to change their lives.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle, either buy revitalized properties for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50-100,000, or downgraded houses for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5-15,000, which they will then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication options are great written, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday destination (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of business people who invest in the medium to long term with the aim of increasing value.
Property in the capital, however, is becoming increasingly expensive, due to the ever-increasing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been an annual increase of 21 percent.
The turmoil in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Six Percent Hungarians
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings on Tuesday are coming to an end, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries advise on the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a fierce debate between industrial and developing countries.
The U.S. has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but would be ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question of the conference is whether the industrialized countries are willing to support developing countries financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement has also been reached on the support of developing countries.
The adaptation fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, expected at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's 6%
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its pioneering role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured by the 1990 values), regardless of whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be achieved successfully. The Union would even be ready to engage in a 30% reduction, provided that other major industrial countries are in the process of developing their countries.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the goal of the countries that acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 per cent, while the EU had already pledged a minus of 8 per cent with its 15 Member States at the time.
The requirement for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will fully meet, as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The commitment is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction plans set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not have a new, international emission reduction system, nor will it follow the international emission reduction system, which is the most free of the IP, which is also the most important of its requirements.
As a result, the reduction of emissions would be delayed, and an increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2<0xC2><0xB0>C would be unavoidable, which according to scientists would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army Advertising on YouTube
British military units have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special Forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations against the Taliban on the net since March 2006, the BBC reports.
The footage shot with miniature cameras mounted on helmets is checked at the Air Force Base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitably
Air Force soldiers have already assisted 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defence headquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces stationed in Iraq (MNFI) own YouTube.
Deployment in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force released the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says, the posts are also intended to inform the public about the actual targets of foreign interventions.
Publicized propaganda of this kind is almost free compared to conventional television advertisements, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message in themselves, as they decide on the legitimacy of the government’s own military action.
Americans advertise with game
However, the army must also fight against amateur footage, which, in addition to the carefully processed, censored footage, will also be put into the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses of the most critically acclaimed, are being smeared.
By the way, numerous videos shot on the platform have already been uploaded from the warheads in Iraq and Afghanistan, but this "gattung" has only recently been discovered by the British for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "Americas Army", in which the player can jump into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less life-threatening simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
The Minister of Labour, Mónica Lamperth, is in no way zymperish: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organizes a working conference where her employees can make coffee and pokatchee the year 2007.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others magical Christmas mood with tombola or instigating into the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - that's how the power celebrates.
The christmas fever has already seized the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry is still being held in the defence area, however, employees of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of orphans" children are gifted by fallen soldiers, at the "mission celebration" family members are greeted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other springs, the National Agency for Development (NFU) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport are pushing the ropes.
The <0x24>4.32 million Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held in the house of the future, with about 350 of the 600 employees expected.
While the focus of the festivities is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a Tombola victory.
The National Agency for Development (NF<0xC3><0x9C>) held its 4.7 million forint Christmas celebration on Wednesday in the House of the National Council of Justice (OIT), with concerts and a party.
The loan amounted to 1 million Forint, the rest was spent on the more than 400 loaded guests.
According to our information, a department of the NF<0xC3><0x9C> is also invited to another Christmas celebration organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information as we have not reached the competent authorities.
What's the suit for?
The ILO building was not only open to the guests of the NFU, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the ILO for the use of the premises.
Approximately 500 visitors came to the ball.
The ceremonies were opened with a speech by the minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], it was noted that there was no obligation of dress or dress on the ball.
The Ministry of Health, Labour, and Self-Government are preparing for a Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for employees in their own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Labour Minister Mónica Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to the annual conference.
It is estimated that there are about 180 guests who - according to the press department - will only be served with coffee and pogatche, so the celebration will go with 350,000 forints.
Self-government minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply be meeting in the hall of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organizing a Christmas celebration in its own festive hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured at 2,500 forints per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent boosts.
Since the beginning of János Veres’ tenure, the PM’s employees have been celebrating every year in this way.
However, there will be no proper party vote - not only because of the minister's official speech, but also because the celebration was set for the afternoon.
On January 20, the Ministry of Agriculture invites to a New Year’s reception, the Ministry’s Christmas celebration this time.
One hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to information from the resort, the expenses are measured at 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple stand-up reception to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, held every year, traditionally start with a brief address by the Minister and sound with a restraining smudge.
As the relevant press offices report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or at the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the cost of Christmas celebrations, no information could be given at the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which will be held in the Museum of Fine Arts.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their Coordination Committee on Friday for the indefinite strike to begin on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest assembly will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the work placement begins.
It is expected to have significant traffic barriers due to strikes, as rail traffic is almost completely stopped, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) will also strike until 13:00.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A large-scale protest assembly will be held on Saturday, and from Monday, all organizations that have joined the strike will put down the work for an indefinite period of time, if no agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike beginning on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strikes.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees will convene to advise on further action.
Due to the National Council's Monday agenda, it is even conceivable that the vote on the Health Insurance Act will not take place until late in the evening, or even at midnight.
The strikes that start on Monday will have to face significant traffic barriers: railway workers are shutting down their jobs for an indefinite period of time, in the morning most of the public transport is still and more than half of the Volán companies are still.
At the same time, there will be highway blocks in one direction in many places.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, others are planning a temporary job interruption.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement was reached between the Hungarian Railways M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Trade Union of the Railways VDSZSZ, although more and more people are on the road during the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, at the BKV from the start of operation until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 p.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and thermal energy will be on strike for four hours, and the teachers' union will have the Democratic teachers' union on 2-b.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes at different times nationwide alternatingly, the EDDZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the league is that the government withdraws the draft health insurance reform and presents a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Claim number three is that the eligible occupational groups will be allowed access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer on the sidelines submitted by the Ministry of Transport and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard increases state risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "intensification of the already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy populations in Hungary".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is presumably aimed at provoking such a dispute, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure by political leaders: "Public persons have left the discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical political groups, who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian opposition".
It is assumed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, promote extremes, and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of domestic and foreign media, "have significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary has been continuously on the rise, so that since summer 2007 several organizations called "national self-defense associations" have been established.
"These groups are common to define themselves as a civilian organization, while openly bragging about preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (catastrophic protection, national defense, law enforcement), in reference to the ineptitude of the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the state, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, the police, etc.
All this is done in accordance with that method, which seeks to tarnish political aspirations as a bourgeois initiative based on the political and party perception of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association is therefore not merely to circumvent the legal barriers that could arise during the registration process - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also an increasing risk factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
“In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, so some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard confirming its own anti-Hungarian policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region,” he said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an individual phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, thus increasing the political risk for the whole region.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was established in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard, Roma mass protests took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents as the occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organization is "national protection".
In her opinion, in the past 17 years, there has been a real "tiger terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained tacit and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
The initiative would have triggered a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As we said, the increased risk of ethnic strife is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also respond to the threats by organizing their own protection, according to the Political Capital Risk Alert Report.
Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
Annually, risk analysis reports would be published, and if risk changing trends are detectable, the public will be informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are regulated precisely by law, so that the practice of re-disposing the working days around the holidays has been established in the meantime, but the coming year will provide us with fewer such days.
Also in the EU and in America, something else is understood as “Friday”.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and unemployed days.
Unemployment days are mostly church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are unemployed days - the latter alone so that the New Year celebrations can rest.
Throughout the year, we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are the 15th of March, commemorating the Revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, commemoration of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, the foundation of the state, on May 1st, the work is celebrated, on November 1st and 2nd, we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each on Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "workday shifting" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holidays, is to be finalized, the Minister of Labour has been set in a separate regulation for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employers, public servants and public service officials.
Excluding only companies and institutions where the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. even on holidays.
Heuer’s work order is only slightly confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life will remain formally in this country, as most of the days between Christmas and New Year’s Eve, or the holidays specifically cancelled for it, take time off.
Next year, more holidays fall into the middle of the week or the end of the week, so there will be less rearrangements on working days than this year.
The calendar is first “set on the head” around the work day, so people can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, 26 April will be a working day so that Friday, 2 May can be a rest day.
The second rearrangement is related to the holiday on October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, you will have to work on Friday, October 24th in advance.
The end of the year, however, will remain restless in the sign of the holidays, after everything is and remains from December 24, even when New Year falls on a Wednesday.
Six discouraging little things to annoy colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: they bring "color" into the everyday workplace.
The question is simply whether you are accustomed to these little inconveniences, or are better confronted with the challenge and try to avoid them consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
“Sorry, I forgot to point out to you that someone called from the marketing department,” says a colleague.
Is it because you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to reclaim it by calling the marketing department and accepting reluctantly that you had forgotten to spread the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the matter is done with an apology.
Before you get involved in embarrassing excuses, you should consider how to prepare your colleagues for truly unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Borrowing something that doesn’t belong to oneself?
There’s hardly anything more nervous than getting a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday was still on the desk - today is it gone?
Or is the lost pen discovered on a colleague’s desk?
Without asking questions, you should not borrow anything from colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find that something is gone.
So, don't put envelopes or post-it out of the office in your pocket, because it could hit one yourself: no more when you need it urgently.
Do you talk about the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a trap that has already been put into the world.
Who's with whom, what's done?
Where and why?
The information (or assumptions) about the privacy of colleagues should not be tied to everyone’s nose if possible!
And if someone opens up and tells us his inner secret, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave, rather than targeting those who are not present, even if others are aware of the problems of the colleague.
Reported ill for no reason?
When you are called to the office to report sickly headaches because you are just feeling uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be clear about one thing: your own work, irreplaceable accomplishments, projects with fixed appointments now have to be done by your colleagues instead of by yourself.
Don’t play badly with your colleagues!
If you already know on the previous day that you won’t be able to work in the office the next day, or that something could happen, why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither colleagues nor the boss will be unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Together, Gekicher, Calling
You are in his work now, but are suddenly disturbed by the loud whistleblower of his colleagues?
Do you want to hear a phone call that you shouldn’t have heard?
You should not bother your colleagues with summons, singing, loud conversations (which you take over their heads), stabbing, persistent sneezing or tingling.
All of this can be very annoying, even if you’re not in the depths of a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not completed on time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the guilt of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not apologize for the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit his mistakes, and apologize if others were affected by them too!
The question of how to correct the mistake again, or retrieve the missing one, is just too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training pants and sleeping: Comfortable for home, but has lost nothing in the office!
Not even then you should dress so naked if the workplace actually allowed it!
Just not to be too slutty - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress in the office accordingly - if desired, also beautiful and elegant!
Wanting to make it right for everyone - or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning stall.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: The sound of a violin, coupled with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume higher.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a true sound jewel a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
The local music scene has not really spoiled us for a long time with qualitative electropop.
But now you can even see the stau differently when you hear Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even when the garage rock with its guitar equity is back in, the domestic electropop proves: There is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, musicing himself in the Yonderboi band, before he - perhaps because a hostel does not tolerate two pipers - began to walk his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which melted elements from jazz, electronics, and pop, he did, however, only when he was asked to compose the soundtrack into a film that approached him (e.g.
"Sezon" by Ferenc Türk).
The formation, which initially appeared in smaller clubs, was not known to the wider audience until the magazine "wan2" ranked its first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums, and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, to be the only, even in the West, marketable trendsetter.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but it didn't interest anyone whether they liked to wear this brand either.
The band has responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new paths for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression originates from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying accent would also be fine, but in addition to the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitars corresponding to the spirit of the time and the trends, the influences of the rock'n'roll, are noted.
With these songs, singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", introduced himself at the Millenáris premiere.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio store - the late-early mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, who broadcast pop music from early to late, has recorded the audience with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six domestic singers ("Underground Divas"), successively sworn to the Ohm.
It's all right (?).
The hvg.hu has asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How far is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "story music" does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative or underground music can be sassy and non-saturating, but it can also be produced only for sale, which makes it a commercial music.
Also, a good pop number can arise from an honest motive.
The readiness of the listener to receive works also according to this principle, regardless of languages and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences of your music?
B. Z.: Overseas, especially in the west of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
There are not only teenagers or Twens going to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentively because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many listen to your music?
B. Z.: Of course, it’s a good feeling to see more and more coming to our concerts.
We have never written for the market.
With us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is most often noticeable in concerts, where there is already mutual interaction, but there is only in the immeasurable changes of the moment.
However, I noticed one thing: if you want to make it all right, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the road as a soloist and has built his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go his way, except for trying to interpret it into our music over and over again.
We see ourselves rather as team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let them develop.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening consciously staged with a somewhat more popular style towards a wider audience?
Z.B.: We had no plans to write a hit that would then be kept as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to solve the sound organization and the somewhat more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why exactly, what was the guiding principle?
B. Z.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of assembling the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene.
Thus the six-headed choir was created - so Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later baptized "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Would you like to have the same song, or did the girls design it?
For example: The number had been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that this number still “needs something”.
The chord sequence has formally demanded a singing voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came practically on arrival and terrifyingly spontaneous.
I can remember I was pretty electrified at the time, but it already needed the "divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have been so strong.
hvg.hu: But both on the record and at the concert, it was the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (except for the short solo by Judy Jay), they have no own role, sing perfectly together and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not just accompanied by the music.
They were also on stage behind the scenes.
Is it intentional?
E.g.: The fact that they were behind was so because of purely technical problems.
However, we did not want to consciously give them solo roles.
The issue is also that one should forget a little about his ego, forgetting who came from and where he is on his way, we simply allow these particular wings, the wings of love, to empower us.
I would have liked others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the hardest song?
B. Z.: In the musical creative work, none at all, there have been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't want to work anymore, but gradually everything has come together, as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song from the new album?
B. Zs.: This is changing with the concerts running and also now that I have “lashed out” the album.
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraud broker risked billions for feelings of inferiority
Floorless scammers
This is how his former employee Jerome Kerviel designates the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komer<0xC4><0x8D>ní banka.
In fact, it was worth almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was just a great player who wanted to do it to his colleagues, beyond that, he was certainly not incapable.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in a timely manner.
"He's mentally weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who showed him to the police.
But as Kerviel’s statements, published by French media, such as the daily newspaper Le Monde, show, he was a man who had made <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion in profits at the end of last year with his business.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in a statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros just during the American crisis.
He had the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were already early reports that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had previously had payment problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profits to 1.6 billion euros.
“Even when I earned the first half a billion, I didn’t know how to explain it,” Kerviel adds, saying he definitely didn’t keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he falsified the documents so that no one gets to him.
He even managed to get his bosses behind the scenes, even though gradually the Eurex stock exchange became interested in his trades.
Risk Profit
Was he afraid to fly?
I'm sure it's scarce.
“I thought it satisfies the simple fact that I earned <0x24>1.6 billion for the bank.”
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to step up his position.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about <0x24>51000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of <0x24>90,000.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as others.
“Even in my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigative officer.
But soon after his entry, the first major success came.
With the Alliance's shares, he earned a lot by investing half a billion euros in price losses in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger – now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we leave you
“It’s like a snowball,” he told the police.
But the bosses allegedly knew about everything, respectively, they figured it out.
"As long as I make money, I close my eyes."
But then at the beginning of this year came the big blow.
In a single day, he lost one billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to compensate for this.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer a bank employee.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion because of it.
And how did they come to him?
He was suspected of taking a vacation.
“I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn’t take a vacation is one who doesn’t want to be looked at in the maps,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes, which allow the Czech Republic to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>365 billion) in the next few years.
This is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in 2007 to 2013 at all.
Approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>125 billion comes from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive approximately 100 billion kroner from the "Enterprise and Innovation" program.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into traffic construction.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money will increase according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Entrepreneurship and Innovation" programme is designed to help entrepreneurs and companies earn money for innovative enterprises.
As a result, companies will gain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic has been among the least successful in the acquisition of money from EU funds so far among the new accession countries.
Nicaraguan Court Confirms 20 Years in Prison for Ex-Presidents
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, who had been convicted of financial fraud in the amount of <0x24>100 million (almost 1.8 billion kroner) in 2003.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest at his hacienda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is again behind bars is currently unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the president of the appellate court, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the detention officials to allow Alemán to be sentenced at home or to go to jail.
A court ruled four years ago that Alemán had regularly transferred government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually landed in a fund that Germany had set up to finance its 2001 election campaign.
The budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget designed by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The current year was still approved with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (Social Democrats) because it had been submitted by Minister Sobotka (of this party) and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the mistrust proposal against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little-respected, yet highly significant law in all calmness.
This is somewhat paradoxical.
Everything starts and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is covered by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more appreciative topic for the media, which is why they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than mere figures.
The budgets of the previous Social Democratic governments were under three weaknesses that the 2008 budget cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high percentage of expenditures that are compulsory by law, with not only pensions, but also social expenditures, which the "still silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficitary budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third constraint is the deficits in public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and to some extent controlled.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many mayors, in addition to income from taxes, taxes and bank loans, gave up other sources of investment, often unconsidered debt securities, by which they excessively owe their town halls.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off these debts through the massive sale of shares of energy and other supply networks that they had received from the state in the course of privatization.
Now this source is already closed.
To the extent that we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we observe that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a phase of growth for a few years now, and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is proud of it.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owe the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more reasonable than our republic.
This is a gigantic scandal that is mainly attributed to previous governments.
We are one of the countries that, on a global scale, are the least endangered by poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes, which unfortunately have been inflated quite redundantly in recent years.
It is clear that, although it has succeeded in eradicating some of the absurd populist spending that was passed this year before the elections, if there is no delay in the retirement age and a pension reform in the coming years, then virtually any policy in this country will end up in the same way as any other policy in this country, and who will be at the top of it?
It is only slightly exaggerated when it is said that then the ruling politicians become officials, which mechanically divide most of the tax revenues into pensions and social spending.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be a revolution, but it can only prevent the shifting of normal expenditure by mandatory expenditure.
The deficit of SEK 70 billion for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments hadn’t spent the last ten years, which was just the case.
If we do not want to really make it to the point of becoming pure administrative officers from ruling politicians, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, who is aware of it that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and fees.
Only these enable the gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.
Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Krej<0xC4><0x8D>í
Banks want to cope with crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to jointly fight the financial market crisis.
Thus, more than <0x24>100 billion will reach the currency markets through auctions.
On these auctions the banks sell interest rates, to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the U.S. Fed sends <0x24>40 billion to auction, another 24 makes it easy for the European and the Swiss central bank.
It is the first time since the attacks of September 11 that the central banks of each country have agreed on such a coordinated action to defend or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
“This move is aimed at eliminating the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of freely available capital that the banks can lend,” Bernard Baumohl of Economic Outlook Group wrote in a report to his clients.
“Central banks’ coordinated action has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. from 65% to about 50%,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost <0x24>60 billion due to unused loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still expecting billions of losses.
“Central banks must have been really afraid of what could happen if they decided to do so,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks have the fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession, possibly affecting economic growth around the world.
The central banks decided to do so after they failed to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank interest rate used to lend money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
“This will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step helps the central banks to warm the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Ecological debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is alleged to be the most harmful to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke about the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the end of the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not Green Planet", he concluded that the debates of ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word firework that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
In presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject matter was very important to him, and that that is why he is so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book would appear in German translation because "I often encounter cartoons of my views."
Interested parties could now read his attitude unmistakably.
Klaus reminded that he is not a climatologist, but he believes that he has sufficient conditions to write such a book.
After all, he is an academic, capable of understanding and assessing professional negotiations, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
As the main thesis of the book, he referred to the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among the scientists about global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious, that we are not overly concerned, that we are not overly concerned, that we are not threatening, that we are not threatening the development of the climate.
In addition, he considers it as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems to impose on others unacceptable, unproven views, he sees it as a dangerous restriction to freedom.
On questions from attendees, he reiterated that he is not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and output."
Klaus had talked about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver’s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to apply for the exchange so that the authorities are able to issue a new driver’s license by the end of the year.
The ministry, however, is not afraid that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will go to the streets without a valid driver’s license.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have changed their driver's license.
While small towns report a sharp decline in interest in the leadership exchange, the capital’s offices are overwhelmed with applications, and interest in the exchange grew this week.
The municipality produces around 2,000 customers a day.
You have to stop for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver’s license.
The issuance of a new driver’s license lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened deadline of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 kroner.
Drivers who do not create the required exchange until the end of the year and leave without a valid driver’s license will be subject to a fine from January.
The offender pays a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police can also use it with a warning in the case of the violation.
In the event of an infringement, the penalty may be increased to 2,500 kroner.
According to previous information, the person who is not driving may also be punished by the municipality.
He could, it was said, threaten a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has already called on the offices to let the mildew go and impose a fine of no more than 1,000 crowns.
However, according to the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is facing a thousand-krone penalty.
The driver’s license is a document in which everyone can decide whether or not they want to own it.
It is not a passport that everyone, even a valid passport, must have.
People who don’t want to drive should give their driver’s license.
It is enough to bring him to the competent municipal office or send him there by enrollment.
At the end of the year, driver's licences issued between 1964 and 1993 become invalid.
However, drivers need to gradually exchange other types of driver’s licenses.
People with driver's licenses from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued from 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more driver’s licenses.
Court lowers penalties for detectives allied with Berdych
The former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Kon<0xC5><0x9B>a<0xC5><0x99>ík, who are accused of having done something in common with the gang of David Berdych, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years respectively.
This was decided in a juridical judgment by the Prague Supreme Court, which reduced its sentence by one or two years, respectively.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years, respectively.
Against today’s judgment there is no appeal, only revision in the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych himself is also charged in this matter, he is at first faced with the judgment in the first instance.
In other trials, however, he had already received sentences of a total of 16 years.
Too much can't be condemned.
In January, a district court convicted 19 persons of involvement in robberies, the Supreme Court today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most defendants disputed the charge from the outset with the justification that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, police, in consultation with Berdych criminals, provided information from police sources, covered up various robberies and helped gang members escape the prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Kon<0xC5><0x9B>a<0xC5><0x99>ík for 30 percent of the prey.
The prosecution relates to crimes committed by gangs from 1999 to 2001.
In particular for robberies, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also for official measures and unauthorized possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel cores, a laser-targeted telescope and a machine gun.
The gang has reportedly been enriched by many millions of crowns due to its robbery.
Apart from nearly 20 men in this trial, courts identified Berdych and a number of others as guilty for further robberies.
Other men from Berdych's district must be held accountable in another trial, other cases have not yet been brought to court.
To date, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in Irish custody and awaiting the final decision on their extradition for criminal prosecution in the Czech Republic, have left the main proceedings.
Children exchanged: <0x24>12 million
The lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand compensation of 12 million kroner from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>, plus court costs.
For each mother <0x24>3 million, for each father <0x24>2 million, and for each child <0x24>1 million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál, therefore disagrees completely with the proposal of Velebas.
"We reject such a proposal, it is too high for a number of reasons," Dostál said after today's debate.
“But in order to form an opinion on this counterproposal, we need the opinion that made the opposite side.
We will find out if it is worth it at all.
But we insist that this should be in the range of hundreds of thousands for all together," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 kroner for each of the four parents.
At first, the family from Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov wanted a million crowns for every month she hadn’t raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, an opinion that had been prepared by the University Hospital in Prague Motol served as the basis for compensation negotiations.
The parents of the children, according to specialists in the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered mental damage and stress symptoms in varying strengths and depths.
The men tolerated the stress situation better, even if they saw charges against themselves, they could have prevented the confusion of newborns.
Women, in turn, cope worse with the effects of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is happening right now, Veleba summed up the content.
Veronika and Nikola translated the nurses of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> on December 9 last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>ermáks in P<0xC5><0x99>íbyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the district chief of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina (Bohemian-Mahrian Highness) handed over 100,000 crowns to each family in exchange for expenses incurred by the error of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>, which underwent the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability.
In case of doubt, they have to resort to a reserve fund, only exceptionally they can apply for help from the carrier.
The courts have so far granted to the affected relatively low amounts of damages, the amounts were determined by tables and ranged in the range of hundreds of thousands, with exceptions of millions.
Polivka came to his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand "Kingdom of Walachei".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> in collaboration with the actor in many years of work.
Polívka did not participate in the hearing today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over, and his client will probably file an appeal.
“The dispute is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team want to participate in Bolek Polívka’s popularity parasitic,” Polívka’s lawyer said after the hearing.
All of them presented themselves with the words "Walachian Kingdom" to this actor and comedian.
The same opinion is Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We have almost a decade of work behind us.
Gaining money and concepts of activities,” he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
“After years, they have noticed that the project is successful and that they could have some of it as well.
They want to win parasitic at our work,” he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "King of Wallachia" for the first time in one of his television programs.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohaty.
But this was not related to the intention of establishing a fictional kingdom at the time.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Balinese passports.
A business and entrepreneurial activity emerged from an original fun action, to which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then joined the founding of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polivka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered its owners discounts on visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also pointed out today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> used only the idea that Polívka made public in the broadcast "Manage" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Kingdom of Valais," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, who had been intensely dedicated to it.
The cooperation of today’s disputed parties lasted until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> began to rise, which culminated in the deposition "King Boleslav I elected until the Day of St. Nimmelin".
The leadership role was then claimed by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>s Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková as the queen mother.
In 2002, Polivka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the race prepared by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> for the throne and a half princess.
A new king should emerge from this.
He didn’t want to tell me details and an appointment.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It should be like the royal train in the Walachei.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Polívka can also sign up quietly," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: advantages disappear
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear circuit, steering and also processing could be referred to as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that is much better.
The SW combi is a little further, and I just have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the too low headlessness on the rear seats.
These complaints are no longer there, because the body of the combi is designed so that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Quickly continue
I only go through the interior briefly so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, where I have only objections because of the caring middle tunnel.
I would like to welcome some more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over when we may complain about too short seats or headrests.
The side content has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As far as the space range is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body here.
The lack of headlessness already mentioned has also been eliminated in the combi.
Luggage in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the charging space.
I have to refer to it (also because of the folding back window) as very well loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with holding belts that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be pulled apart and even hold heavier objects.
But let’s talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 liters, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
By comparing the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is clearly 52 litres behind.
For a holiday abroad or when you invite a carriage, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat charge space or the very low charge edge after folding the rear seats.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline engine with a capacity of 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kWp.
And to be honest, this should look like a 1600-cubic engine that drives a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him to his counterpart at <0xC5><0xA0>koda, which sometimes seems like his exhaust is stuck with a lap, then I can only be excited about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
However, we must remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1,400-cylinder engine at a height of 329900 kroner is still on the rise.
With our engine it costs from 410900 SEK, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car once again hits with 80,000 kroner in addition to the bow.
However, we had headgear bags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper exhaust, electric window lifts behind and...
So the car costs a total of SEK 531900.
That’s a lot, but once you calculate the extra equipment of a Fabia together and you’ll arrive at a very similar sum.
There is only one decision to choose which brand to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, causing local fears about the further development of local schooling.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has hitherto faced a number of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the indigenous population are increasing in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated in the case of North Kent, where the clashes between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, schikans and rallies among students have shifted to the relationships between parents.
The situation has evolved so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a 10-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The defendant defended herself by insulting her with racist accusations.
Police also had to attack a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two minor girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw him with stones.
“When we went home, a boy climbed up a bus hut and spucked on us.
When I told him to stop, he stabbed us with apples and pears and then uncovered his throat,” a mother of Slovak students told The Times another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals called the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe even a struggle to survive.
The aforementioned cases show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is getting more and more tense.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks have been reported to come here in search of employment.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will be fulfilled if you only choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and busy cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
But only on one island can you find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their base for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana was once a storage or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spaniards had stolen from America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was founded at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the chiefs of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the prohibition) was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses, over the wide boulevards, drove cars, which were among the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails at your request.
And the cult cars of the Fifties are driving in Havana to this day, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and damp air.
Havana, in particular its oldest part, may have fallen heavily, nowhere in the vicinity can you find as many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are just being excavated, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism is bringing urgently needed money, there was green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a marotte that is unique in the world and attracts railway lovers above all.
The sugar pipe from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-operated narrow-track railways to the sugar mills.
Its fleet has not been renewed for decades, so you can see clean and fully functioning locomotives, whose age-old comrades have been in the museum for a long time.
Destinations
The most important places are not omitted by the majority of visitors to Cuba.
You no longer have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
It remains to be mentioned that in Hemingway’s already mentioned estate there is a museum whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime floors.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities accumulated fertile soil, which is also covered in windy rock areas by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form you can meet him when you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean sequel to the TV series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Glory and wealth brought her the trade of slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has barely changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road connecting the area to the rest of the country in the 1950s.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it remained unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the "Tal of the Sugar Factories".
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la Música, which revives after the darkness, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba refers to some as the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view will also be influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading there from Guantánamo must overcome high and shattered mountains and run through a landscape barely touched by human intervention.
This eastern suburb of Cuba was included by UNESCO in its World Heritage List thanks to its untouched nature.
It is where the best chocolate is made, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in fact it originated about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill, where the former castle, the present-day Hotel El Castillo, stands, you can see several table hills, of which El Yunque is known.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the bay of pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which many of the descendants of slaves could be recognized.
As they say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the United States according to the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should design a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not go according to their ideas, as was agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, by the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance on the sides of the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defense minister Robert Gates, calls for more activity for NATO units, the United Kingdom sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
“In Afghanistan, progress is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the population to begin a further development of the economy and security itself,” Des Browne, the UK’s defense minister, told the BBC.
Nineteen percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years, according to the U.S. military.
The number of violence has increased by 27 per cent compared to the previous year, even by sixty per cent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the Allies have reached an absolute limit with regard to the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they call for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
“We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next time and the way we can achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop said the same today.
“I’m not happy with what we have available in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that’s too little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been a dispute among the participating countries over whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British boulevard newspaper "Sun" this week called the German soldiers "faulpelze".
"Afghan non-slayer uncovered: The Germans make games while our boys are fighting," the Sun wrote in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German educational newspaper went over for counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby competition in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will accelerate to a trillion in 2009
For every Czech Republic there is a debt of 84,000 kroner.
Total debt rose to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government had planned to owe 159.2 billion cones this year.
However, in early December, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of the state budget policy.
The Czech Republic’s government debt rose to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
As a result, within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its data on the state debts from the beginning of October.
For each Czech Republic there is a debt of 84,000 kroner.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 billion kroner.
So far, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not be going beyond the limit of a trillion kroner until 2009.
Next year, debts should range between 900 billion and a trillion kroner,” said David Marek, analyst at Patria Finance, to the iHNed.cz server.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, says: “To exceed a billion we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, that could last until 2010.
But I am not assuming such a change,” he noted.
Debt Grows
The state debt comes from the government’s debts and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The government debt is financed through treasury statements, government debt securities, direct bonds or, for example, through bonds of the European Investment Bank.
This year’s domestic government debt has risen to SEK 719.4 billion.
The state’s foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called marketable government debt reached SEK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average debt default rate rose to 6.5 years.
Over the course of the year, the total debt increased by 13 percent from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot in terms of how well the economy is going.
Interestingly, growth is especially noticeable in the case of debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand, this shows that something can be done before the pension reform comes,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of public debt for 2007 show that the government planned to raise 159.2 billion kroner for this year.
However, in early December, thanks to the improved development of the state budgetary policy, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner.
This amount is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion kroner this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion kroner.
In addition, these are maximum planned funds for the Consolidation Agency amounting to SEK 13.3 billion, a 10 billion pension reserve, the financing of debt securities for SEK 43 billion, and rates for the European Investment Bank's bonds of SEK 1 billion8 in Höar.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been accused of insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening.
The British woman was accused of having allowed six- to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name of Muhammad, although any depiction of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She deserved to be kicked out.
After parents of students complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher, who worked at Unity High School in Khartoum, was arrested at home on Sunday, and in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, the Islam bullying was beset.
In fact, this issue starts in September when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, school principal Robert Boules reports.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 of the 23 children choose Muhammad as their favorite first name.
Sure, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic Prophet, but above all, it is also a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the picture signature My name is Mohammed.
The bear himself did not wear a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, who taught at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew her well, and she would never have done anything that would have allowed her to get too close to a religious belief, I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name here, it was her age.
A view shared by many of the teacher’s pupils, describing them as being very attentive to her pupils and as a person who never speaks about religion in class.
It should be borne in mind that the surname Mohammed is also the second most commonly given second name in the UK, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of tribute to the prophets (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This, of course, is a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
At the end of the failure
Serbians and Albanians from Kosovo have closed a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversy over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status, European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, his American counterpart Frank Wilsner urged Belgrade and Pristina to comply with their commitments to the maintenance of peace, and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
There will be no violence in the immediate future, but we are standing at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, indicating that there are quite clear tensions.
End of the meetings on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking inhabited province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submitted their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last session of negotiations since the Troika in August, which had been ordered by the UN to re-mediate.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mission to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo's independence from the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
Russia has been and remains a proponent of a negotiated solution, a consensus solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under the administration of the UN for eight years, the Western countries keep the EU's independence under supervision for the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to declare them unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations had been the last chance since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that Belgrade’s proposed plan for autonomy belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino Effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, in turn, felt that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly afraid of a "domino effect" in a region still so weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision would be made solely and solely in the Security Council, where their Russian ally has a right of veto.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only one decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations lasted two years.
They have to end up the way they started: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu replied that the parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population will take place in coordination with the Western countries.
Bush unlocks agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which was held under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He added that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two sides of their commitments to the peace roadmap that they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately aimed at a peace agreement that would clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This designation covers the three serious problems to which the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians turn mainly: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees who, in the course of the 1948 conflict, were evacuated from their homeland, Israel.
After the American president, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a settlement for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert, in turn, took the floor, he pledged that the upcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would endeavour to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for implementing his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, which exist side by side, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received a guarantee from Bush in this sense before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was a great success for Washington, has led a plan taken by all Arab countries to the path of offering peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a divisive path in the history of the Middle East, especially as it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi Prince said in an interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic daily newspaper.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are faced.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of investigations by the National Disciplinary Police Authority (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5:00 p.m., a police car drove on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on the strip, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, a police spokesman said.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without approval, so not released for public road transport (see below), came, driven by two young people without helmet, at very high speed.
It hit the left side of the police car after disregarding its advance from the right, a police officer said.
The alcohol controls carried out by the vehicle passengers were very negative.
The condition of the carriage (bevelled wing, split windshield, broken bumper) indicates the severity of the impact.
Very soon yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of the involuntary murder and the lack of assistance to persons at risk" in order to ensure the safety of persons at risk.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she is excluded from the responsibility of the police investigating the IGPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police officers, namely that this small-power wheel arrived relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday, a sort of groove, probably caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained interlocked until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical inspection.
The bodies of the two victims were auctioned yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, there was a quick rumor that the police would have left the scene very quickly, without giving the two young people any help.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious errors concerning this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigations, which require further investigations, and in which one must be very careful.
Libération met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, says this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman sneering.
Two others tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth phoned.
Given the tension that had quickly formed over the incident and, it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen of colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident were taken into the car.
Still, according to this testimony, the rescuers arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police forces did not provide any help to the youth.
First aid was provided to these young people.
The firefighter arrived immediately.
"Everything was done to try to save her," the prosecutor said.
In Pakistan, tensions are rising
On Monday, Pakistani police knocked down the first demonstrations since General Musharraf called the emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the town of Lahore, in the eastern part of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the state of emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades employed by the law enforcement forces there.
They then threw stones with which they wounded the policemen.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police lawyers attacked and injured.
Several would have been temporarily detained.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court’s lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition, human rights defenders and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the roads leading to the Supreme Court were blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations had taken place in Multan (centre) and in Peshawar (northeast).
On Monday, the lawyers’ movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the people to call on the judges who voted against the state of emergency to give up a murragee before the fallout, and those who refused to give up.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to re-elect President Musharraf’s legality in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to surrender the command over the army and become a civilian president is no longer valid since the call of the state of emergency, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
It was expected that he would issue his military uniform until November 15, the date on which he ended his first term as president.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that the elections could be postponed from January.
In addition, the Pakistani government denounced the persistent rumors that President Musharraf had been assigned a residence by his deputy army leader.
More than a third of pregnancies are not planned.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Still today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, according to a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which finds that the percentage of pill users between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has nevertheless enabled a better control of fertility.
Eight out of ten births are planned carefully nowadays.
At one of five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular Repair at the Space Station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is essential for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit, which has achieved several records due to its duration, the distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem arose on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the module Harmony from the Discovery Space Shuttle, a large cylinder-shaped part that is expected to soon include the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module lab.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to implement a 17.5-ton module for power generation via solar collectors already on the ISS, in order to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew began to restructure the solar collectors of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can fold up like chords, was damaged by a clamped cable of about one meter in length.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to further damage the collector.
Astronauts, who initially left the Discovery space shuttle for a check-up, and then had to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30-meter remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle, which had been attached to the station, to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resilient, very skilled, it has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully examining the damage, he broke through the faulty cable and fastened a kind of rail on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained close to the lock, and, from within, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, Commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey batter, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar collectors that generate several hundred volts, had been designed and built by the astronauts on board the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the Discovery space shuttle to be expected to take the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock market
After the Aviation and Defence Group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the remaining A400M, EADS is currently showing a significant drop on the Paris Stock Exchange.
Currently, EADS is losing 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 once again, taking into account the residues caused by the only slow-moving development of the A400M engine that delayed the aircraft’s virgin flight.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, the parent group of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operational performance targets (EBITs) for 2007 on Thursday at the presentation of its quarterly results, he added without further details.
The Group also indicates that the estimate of the new costs is related to the six-month residue.
To recall, EADS’ business performance fell by 86% in 2006, largely due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, that of the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The Choice of Status Quo
It will not be exciting to count the urns on Sunday: the masses of the Russians will decide for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
After a very sluggish election campaign, she confirms her striving for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to voters, which has already been recorded, but whose contents are kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which a overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President made no clear when he received foreign ambassadors, and was satisfied to provide a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference - his favorite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have done so.
It celebrates an election campaign stained by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former chess champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstration, according to his lawyer, continuing to ban visits.
The Russians have retained the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus
Two further questions have been raised following these unprecedented parliamentary elections:
Who will be Putin’s successor as president?
The official newspaper yesterday announced the date of the first election of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 time to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party United Russia, who will elect the government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the current power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have retained the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they are not the master of their destiny, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further: in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe, civil society has only evolved very slowly; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has reconnected to the model of a paternalist state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more so, since this new paternalism was followed not by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, according to Maria Lipman of the CarnegieS.
Today, the Russians of free will give up the personal responsibility they have briefly put forward after the collapse of the USSR.
What to think about for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands keeping the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local electoral lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equivalent to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcheredtchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What are we thinking about for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why are they replacing them?
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidential treatment, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of the 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, have not been accessed until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individually and namely, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his relatives.
In May 2006, the eleven states in charge of their administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow to conduct investigations, especially about the deportations of prisoners, the prisoners of concentration camps and the health of forced workers, says Reto Meistern, head of these archives, who are being investigated by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CIC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public, due to the delicate nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The prisoners’ lists of concentration camps or the detention orders issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest, in order to make them the way to their detention.
Today in Bad Arolsen more than 300 permanently handled tens of thousands of personal requests.
However, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in accessing Bad Arolsen.
Nothing fundamentally new can be expected in these documents, said Professor Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India are seeking a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, trade between India and Europe is already reaching 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission a green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to European Commission figures, India is only the EU’s ninth trading partner.
A free trade pact will greatly advance the two economies and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second largest market for the ten most common products exported from India, the European Commissioner said, the European Commissioner continues to be the first and the second largest exported products to Europe.The Asian and European giants are still exchanging goods worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion and services worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 billion.The European Commission has not been able to offer hand-in-hand and services to the European Union in exchange for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 billion.

Bank of England Takes Note of Disturbance and Offers <0xC2><0xA3>10 Billion for Five Weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday expressed concern about curbing the current recurring concern over credit conditions, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion bid at a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to start organising their liquidity positions at this time, the bank intends to open up in a 6th form, in which a significant part of their savings will be held.
The bank further explains that in this way at 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation on 6 December, at the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time the BoE has been putting liquidity into circulation in an open-market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it is ready to take further measures to obtain the different interest rates of interbank lending from day to day at its basic rate.
The inter-bank interest rate varied from day to day on Wednesday at 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate has risen to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the start of the financial crisis in the summer, the amounts circulated by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalties that had prevented the banks from claiming them.
According to some rumors, reinforced by the development of the pound exchange rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review PS’s purchasing power proposals
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist draft law on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text created in the framework of a socialist niche (session on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping) indicated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, of which the majority of 50% were for employment allowances, for reintroduction of the TIPP, for floating quotas or for a transport ticket.
After UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to partially violent word-changing between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy’s television contribution on purchasing power.
Leading MP Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of finances, which had been reviewed by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of the UK producer Melvin Benn.
It’s an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a role model for the current festival movement in America,” said Charlie Jones of C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping holiday destination.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes away from Philadelphia.
Festival Director Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most renowned festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also taken care of the production, licensing and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever attended, says his company and Melvin Benn are working alongside each other to provide the area with a festival event in the European style.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are eagerly working with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We were negotiating with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
“Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates about the current administration,” continues Charlie Jones.
Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population.”
C3 Presents has resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grand Park Chicago after it profiled itself in the world of the festival together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The two events in 2007 were able to achieve <0x24>9.8 million and <0x24>11.8 million each in gross taxation days.
These two festivals take place in a urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a rural festival, while ours is more likely to take place on the urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
“The goal is to in one way or another merge these two concepts together, to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival on the European and urban in the American way.”
Vineland is approximately halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes the burden of this event with pleasure,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to award the terms of the agreement, but he confirms "that they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and host a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the filming capacity of the festival is "very large" in approximately 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing was yet to be confirmed when they were printed.
“Vineland will offer tasty rock, but the music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who won the Top Independent Promoter Award at the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It’s not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no one is less than the Terminator.
These lock attempts are part of the delegate tasks.
A political "heikles" mandate because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "Governor"?
“You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones you think are the best,” he says.
Running to the festivals.
However, for Denis Turcotte at the moment, bringing the cinema there is a top priority.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all the West Coast festivals, although Sundance’s from Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure the producers give interviews.
The Dark Ages had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec has also featured four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market ahead of an end-of-year rally? Discrepancy among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just five weeks to the end of the year on the stock market, investors are already rubbing their hands in terms of the upcoming end-of-year rally.
However, the experts cannot make certain predictions in this regard.
Banif believes that, purely statistically, the month of December on the stock exchange usually coincides with a positive market development
However, it is not advisable to make short-term forecasts and only based on statistics, especially if the current market situation is determined by serious tensions.
While other experts do not see such a strong price increase in the last few weeks of the year, they still note that the exchange rate is determined by the liquidity of the market and the market participants, which are largely invested due to the lack of secure equity funds, which are mainly at the disposal of trust funds.
As a result, according to these experts, the stock market will rather have a rather lateral trend, influenced by market fluctuations, mainly because we are not yet able to estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the U.S. Notenbank, an uncertainty that is due mainly to the rise in the level of the raw ice.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost 4% of 15,945.7 points since its peak on November 8.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional allocation of the pension fund each year around this time.
However, the expert points out that this year, things could evolve a little differently, especially due to the already in the second week of December, and thereafter immediately after the bridge day on the day of the Constitution, the final year rally taking place.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the current market assessments are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values, the extent of which depends on the consequences of the US-Hypo.
The analyst is confident that these results will be positive.
When selecting the values to drive the Ibex to new heights, the analysts agree.
Solana of Intermoney argues that this year the big values are in line.
Among the value winners, the expert would include the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
In the meantime, Federico Olucha of the Bank Inversis assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally really happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on track in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same path, the expert said.
With regard to the increased consumption behaviour during Christmas days, periodic consumption will determine what will happen in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in a small number in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only seen a decline in courses in two cases.
At the end of 2003, when the technology bubble broke, this led the stock market out of its crisis and simultaneously initiated the last real final year rally so far.
This year, when the Ibex 35 rose by 28.17 percentage points, December saw a 6.68% increase in the rate.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth consecutive year (the Ibex has been increasing by 8.36% since January) and also a final year rally will show up.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in Spain’s most economically strong regions.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches are a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular as the first banking group, it dares to extend the opening hours of its branches to 20.30h on weekdays and to set up Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The banking group BBVA, which has also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours at its branches, has not yet taken a definitive decision.
The bank’s ongoing negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aiming at an agreement where 75% of all branches are closed on Saturday and open for this on a weekday afternoon, although not for the customer.
Whether further banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening hours, will depend on the experiences of Popular Bank.
And that is also the intention that popular pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches which, because of their location, are able to capture the buying-in-flow of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large stores.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones, and they will be similar to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
In this way, the extension of the opening hours is associated with a new design of the premises, which is characterized by a more current, colorful design.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, the bank’s responsible representative, assures that the restructuring does not require major investments, but was accompanied by increased staffing, as a branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The offices, which will even be equipped with additional facilities for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experiences were positive, says <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
Bravo Murillo, O <0xCC><0x81>Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently runs about 2500 branches.
And another 60, operating under the name Mundocredit, which specializes in immigrants and also has extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these stores of PopularMax, the BBVA model will not be used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to be a competition for our customers, explains Rivero.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally agreed to sell mobile phones using external banking staff.
For the first time, Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco has doubled its stock market value, outdated its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The transmitter led by him had increased its value by twice its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that’s exactly what hurts me; not that we had a higher growth, but that we had lower losses.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they have not fallen too deep.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company’s value now reaches 4,488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento with only 13%.
Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, bringing its market value to 2.193.46 million.
On the other hand, the market value of other publicly traded communications companies increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in the case of Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) to 2,518.53 million and in Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be seen from the fact that these are two similar companies, Vasile said.
Uncertainty still arises the question of to what extent we can actually act on stock exchange technology, at what price and how we can design it at the customer level in a lucrative way.
Telecinco announced a week ago its intention to become the first TV channel this year with more than 1000 million gross revenues from advertising revenues. This was assured by Guiseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising company.
If the project was to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6% compared to the previous year’s 965.4 million.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock market (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from the television business could only have increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The analysts see the main factor for Telecinco’s better stock market performance in the high payout ratio that the company has been able to have so far: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría caused a 100 percent dividend dividend dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio after the purchase of 33% of Endemol shares, with Mediaset as its parent company, could still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have reported significantly more so far.
I hope we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we could already increase by buying 33% of the Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market is currently experiencing certain loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10.5 per cent in 2008 to 8.4 per cent and from 5.5 per cent in 2009 to 5.1 per cent.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and by 7.5% for 2009.
3 Options.

The Congress approves the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on November 1.
Parallel to the parliamentary drafting, which today ended its meeting with the Senate decision on the amendments to the project, the government published the provisions arising out of the new law with the intention to allow the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of Congress and Senate MPs, who had pursued the goal in their negotiations and votes, to establish the best possible regulation that ensures the safety of investors and ensures that the individual entrepreneurs’ activities are regulated in a way that unifies all trademarks.
The MIFID, which re-establishes the Securities Services Regulations, aims at improving investor protection in addition to modernising the financial markets, increasing the control of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new directive enables both specialized companies and natural or legal persons to provide financial advice, and also contributes to the creation of new financial services firms (ESIS), advisory firms that work together with the investment and mediation companies of securities companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, adding the multilateral systems of securities transactions and the systems for the internationalisation of trade contracts to the regulated circular markets, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment firms to record the focuses of their company profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks in the market and all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Economic Commission of the Congress subsequently provided further changes, with the decision that the securities securities must now be considered as a complex financial means for the investor due to its high risk rate has been confirmed by the U.S. mortgage and banking crisis (USHpo).
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal restriction of the working areas of graduates in economics was used; 30 years after the adoption of the Regulation, which limited the working areas reserved for economics scientists, in 1977.
The Senate, for its part, identified new positions in the financial sector, such as those of the economic mediator working on foreign accounts, which does not require authorization by the CNMV and can offer its services to commercialise products and to acquire customers at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index (HPI) increased by five-tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess inflation rates within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek a comparison of local and quality with U.S. products through the disclosure of the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared in advance by applying the same procedure as in the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Commission (INE) warned that the indicator, as determined in advance, should only serve as a benchmark, and therefore should not be consistent with the final result announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (VPI) will remain at a relatively high level.
According to Deputy Head of Government and Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in VPI in November is a temporary development; at the same time, he assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However, Solbes noted in the halls of the congress building that even if the current figure is not good, Spain’s inflation difference to the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economy and Finance announced in terms of the forecast released today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock revenues of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion over the next three years
Northern Rock’s stocks have fallen by more than half since the bank in mid-September last year, as a result of the crisis, asked the British Notary Bank for an emergency loan, and are currently only <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (equivalent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,800 million).
At that time, the bank’s assets were record amounting to <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, an amount that has fallen substantially within two and a half months due to loss of trust of customers and even despite the government’s 100% guarantee that the money will be safe until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, will have to contribute about a quarter of the revenue of the British banks that will build up from the investments there for the next three years to acquire exactly those <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion that will still be reached by their target of 30 million.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to release <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 million (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) annually in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged involvement in urban building corruption
The Spanish police arrested today the current mayor of the municipality of Murcia, Totano (Partido Popular), due to the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipality and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo last May represented the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Partido Popular and at the time chairman of the municipality of Totana, and could be the original wire watcher of the plot, according to information from the broadcaster Cadena SER.
Officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
Juan Morales’ lawyer has also been charged with the main suspect in the case of city-building corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to the information of the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged MP Juan Morales was arrested upon leaving his client's residence due to important tax documents that are supposed to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information from Morales’ alleged order payments to a Galician construction company, which was in the process of concluding an urban contract in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Currently, eight people are in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE’s candidacy in Toledo and, in case of an election victory, in Congress.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, has accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a victory over the Congress of the Socialist Party.
José Blanco, PSOE’s organizational secretary, and Bono announced it at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party headquarters.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, the politician from the Mancha would appear to be running for the party as Congress president.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as President of Congress, who announced on November 15 that he would no longer participate in the next general election, end his career in public policy and instead engage in the field of university climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the Prime Minister had continuously pushed for his return to political affairs.
In addition, he pointed out that the party, as with the appointment of the Vice-President of the Economy, did not want to deter the citizens who would take over the posts of the President of Congress in the event of an election victory, and called this an act of transparency.
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to turn the House into a house of respect, not of insult or of screaming, so that it will appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, the impression is that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and quietly is Congress; so the Prime Minister has been interrupted in the Senate up to 26 times.
At the same time, he commended the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to make it appear that he had already taken over the office, otherwise his political opponents would call it arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate is subject to relentless criticism by both climate change skeptics and those who put a social and political debate at the forefront of it, the movement as a whole must put on a strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement, who, as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new contract with the planet.
However, this proposal brings him to the attention of his Government's action or non-commercial action, which has contributed decisively to Spain being at the forefront of the EU's countries that have met the Kyoto Protocol's requirements at the least.
Who are the ones responsible for failing to comply with the requirements, which sectors this is due to, and why his government, which had proposed the contract with the planet, has not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures he envisages against climate change without hesitation.
What companies will be affected by this, what behaviour of citizens should be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and what economic consequences there are.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice and will pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there will and will not be any such explanations in the future.
It’s because it’s about sacrifice and payment.
The measures that can be taken against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE seemed strategically dangerous enough that Zapatero was forced to withdraw the proposal again.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, that is, with pure propaganda and empty proverbs, without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, minutes and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politicians who are otherwise suitable for election campaigns must neither speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead follow the demanding issue of decorating the meetings and inspiring others with his tenderness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not assume that the bike will become the only means of movement in the future or we can only refresh with a compartment.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to a suspected involvement in an urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the village of Totana in Murcia, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo, and the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office, and a hotel businessman, on suspicion of being in a city-built town.
The City Council was arrested at its residence, from where it was taken to the municipal office and in its premises until now, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are in connection with the previous visits to Galicia, Murcia and Madrid on Monday, in which it turned out that more than 2 million hectares of unexplored building ground for urban projects under the leadership of the Galician construction company were to be redesigned to the 4th floor of this building.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested directly, but underwent an investigation procedure, which is initiated and carried out by the first court of Totonas.
The first six detainees were brought to the court today.
According to a statement from investigative circles, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP MP Juan Morales are also being investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a property company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, residing in Murcia, are suspected.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria Group , the lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo, Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the CEO of Suelo de Inmonauar Pablo José M.G., whose company is intended to be a part of Nuaria and hold the lubricant.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban crime, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives carried out eleven further investigations in addition to the arrests, most of which were found in companies directly related to (Matana, Madriga, Rozdra, Las Mugo, and Vidrive).
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farm, who was reported to have acted as an intermediary.
Nuaria was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the village of Murcia, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
In Totana, the company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of area to be rebuilt, with the aim of implementing a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates the car parks of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico in Vigo; Hogartel, whose activity focuses on the sector of proto-marketing, which is limited to the pro-marketing sector.
Things that can happen
Articles 1 and 2
If you agree, we will avoid the term Book of the Month and instead try to invent a price tag of another name with corresponding competencies.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are warmly invited to submit your suggestions.
Article 2
Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finnland is, by the way, at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on 18 November.
After the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela, the contents of the field of philosophy became the subject of public debate.
Responsible for the cruel murders is an alumni who quoted in his news the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
In an interview with the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper, Pekka Elo, chairman of the Educational Council for the Department of Philosophy, asked teachers to take a more critical stance on Plato and suggested that Plato’s teachings from the undergraduate curricula for the Department of Philosophy at the gymnasium.
Article 3
A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, which would be subject to six months in prison.
However, if you steal a music store under a value of 400 euros, it is only considered a simple breach (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft is committed as a crime, but the penalty is less than a download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, then the penalty is still lower than when you download it (Article 244.1).
D. It is less difficult to participate in a bargain than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious confrontation is subject to a three to 12 months in prison (Article 154 of the Penal Code), while the data exchange is subject to a six-month to two-year release.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184(2) of the Penal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less bad than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyrighted films not authorised by the authors is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, yes, so if my colleague should be right, then someone has pretty well screwed up his claims.
Article 4
My doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles titled: Money leads to activation of certain areas of the brain, especially if the others get more of it.
Thus, the feelings arising from the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was created using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Brain Research Center, activation was the strongest when the participant gave the right answers and his participant failed.
The researchers were able to realize that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were right with their response and thus received the same salary; but when one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I’m not quite sure if it actually requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been searching for the perpetrators of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her office is located in the Prosecutor’s Office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and laughing eye, as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - which killed eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - namely the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Freshmans are still on Karadzhi-Bosnian territory.
Their names are on a list that the director Marcel Schüpbach, from Switzerland, does not appear as a template for the title of his documentary film La Liste de Carla (2006, in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a polit thriller, directs the Swiss prosecutors coming from Belgrade to the streets of New York, the prosecutors in front of their home.
Which insurance is best suited for me?
KFZ insurance, which covers a possible accident caused by the driver, involves a high cost cost, the amount of which depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of issue of the driver's license, family status, type of car to be insured and car insurance.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even harder to find the right KFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, one must be clear what we have to do with it here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement is concluded in writing by means of an insurance contract, which states that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged in return to submit the corresponding compensation amount in case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance consisting of several factors, including age, gender, date of issue of the driver's license, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
The insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contribution payments will also be due in the event of a higher risk of accidents.
For this reason, both over the age of 25 and women have to make fewer contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their prudence.
The same is true for married people, as they tend to have fewer accidents, according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the companies.
The benefit measured to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus also the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, insurance must take into account a whole range of points.
For this reason, the driver also needs to study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
At this point, we are now listing the most important points to consider when choosing an insurance, in order to be able to make not only a performance, but also a price-oriented choice.
Those under the age of 25 encounter a number of obstacles when choosing an inexpensive insurance, such as low driving practice and young driver’s license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance coverage to take out a full-time insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full-time self-employed car, so that the benefits of full-time insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract involves the customer having to pay part of the amount caused by the damage himself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is the lower the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain’s chief representative at First Europa, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is the extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damages, but not against the damages incurred by your own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
If you are under the age of 25, it’s up to you to reduce the insurance costs; so your credit rating increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the base rate of the insurance company concerned.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the said tariff.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can afford to increase the bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for the drivers to enter into a contract. The reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it is most appropriate to opt for a full-time insurance with self-interest.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish leader of the European company, adding that the majority of the accidents occurred in the second year of practice after the start of the accident.
However, it is advisable for a married customer who does not have children to take full insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the person in question is allowed.
On the side of the insurers, couples with children are considered the customers with the lowest accident rate, and therefore their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a full-cash insurance with self-improvement (with an amount of around 300 euros) would be the best option. If you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which will only be used for the third year of the vehicle.
They are generally more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, notes Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is offered to complete a full cash insurance with self-imputation (at an amount of about 150 euros), or an extended insurance that only applies with a sufficiently high credit.
Ultimately, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it carries high costs, which require a thorough selection that matches our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes to reach the 8th final in Milan
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will fight for the point that they lack to reach their respective goals before the Champions League round is over, and the Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while this part of their decision over the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another one to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not score the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D games will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to compete in the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the semi-finals on the 13th, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be finished before everyone else and the indecisiveness in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium would lead to the long-awaited result, even if both teams would try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the position of the Celtic Glasgow knows that in the event of a victory they would be defeating A in the group stages and better at that.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even qualify for a defeat in a defeat of FC Shakhtar, but he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because with nine points of equality, the Ukrainians are eligible for participation, but they lost 2-0 in Glasgow last week (2–1).
Thus, the Milanese will try to mix the evening with the Scots again hoping to reach the eighth final of the redesigned Champions League for the second time in a row, after they were defeated in the same round in the previous season by a goal of Kaka in the aftermath of the match (1-0) and now lost to the draw (1-0).
While the FC Shakhtar is awaiting the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the eighth-final and its UEFA membership depends on its victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its low standing position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could reach third place by winning and thus joining UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
In Vancouver, Canada, the Spice Girls gave 20,000 spectators the start shot for their first tour after the band's dissolution in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the start of their concert at the GM Stadium that the band's Stiragung was again in Vancouver.
Around 20,000 people were able to co-live the concert in the sold out stadium, which showed a video about the band’s history that had provided furore at the end of the 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour intersect with the release of a new album, which includes its biggest hits and two new songs, headlines and voodoo, which will be released under the label EMI in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore on stage gold bracelets that Posh Spice’s husband, English footballer David Beckham, had given them before.
The athlete was among the fan masses in the audience that set the GM Palace on fire, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham made it clear that the British star hasn’t gotten our wardrobe on a single occasion, and that’s why I’m really excited about what he’s going to like about the show.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements two years later led to the group's dissolution, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press conference.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the public attitude had changed, that the feelings for the Spice Girls had changed.
And that’s why I thought why not; so I’m happy to have made this decision, Chisholm expressed about the separation of the band that caused her nine years ago.
The singer also made it clear that the disputes had been resolved and that everyone has been very fond of each other since then.
However, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
For the first time, the group arrived in a special machine by Virgin Airlines in Vancouver, according to CTV.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid, they will enter the stage on December 23.
New Concerns About Natural Gas Conflict Between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is escalating between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk of Russian fuel exports to Western Europe being affected.
Most of Russia’s natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine, and every dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
An earlier conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to EU countries.
The latest conflict between Kiev and Moscow is at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be more calculated, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for imports of Gazprom.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks,” Ukraine’s economic minister Anatoli Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changing prices of natural gas should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This resulted in a drop in exports to Western Europe, which led to a drastic increase in prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom supplements its own stockpiles with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must check foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the pre-crime registers for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the supervisory body.
The recommendation of Chief Financial Officer Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought to Scotland in connection with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish State Health Service did not have any accurate estimates of the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The Chief Financial Controller investigated staff recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a field car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video in Old Bailey in October and was charged with the alleged car bombing in the UK.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks prior to hiring foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to verify pre-trial records, the Agency does not have the competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The Auditor-General’s report now states, among other recommendations, that the Board should adopt guidelines on the extraction of the criminal record, which assists employers in controls in different countries.
"While we found evidence of these checks in some staff documents, they were not routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their research guidelines to a high degree before hiring, but added: “Our report shows areas in which the system can be improved to ensure accurate information about the number of foreign health co-operation services.”
BMA Scotland chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations prior to hiring potential NHS staff would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that current pre-employment tests of the NHS Scotland are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the executives had trouble identifying those employees who are allowed for an indefinite period of time.
The investigation further found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian have been mostly complied with.
These include passports, work permits, and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign staff in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a concern to me to do this work in view of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in the updated guidelines on control investigations in advance of the recruitment of all employees would also be reflected in the country's assessments.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the film biography of late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including for the best film.
Awards were also given to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was nominated for Best Actress for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing the British film to the public.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film - on whose soundtrack are The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was shot for just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
Nevertheless, he has awarded two awards to Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known for the cult cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and the best directing debut.
Rock music was the focal point of another award winner at the ceremony when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer was awarded the award for best documentary.
The award for the best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg’s London-based Thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard guys, has won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He’s my type of man, a great actor of his time, I’m really honored.”
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia has discovered yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants because of their belonging to cells that were planning an upcoming attack on an oil plant, as well as on clergy and security forces.
The world’s largest oil exporter’s state television said one of the cells planned to smuggle rockets.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid intervention force to protect the world’s largest oil refinery in Abqaiq in 2006 after a failed Al Qaeda attack.
The report, referring to a interior statement, says that 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a "missile expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reported that the militants had planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees, according to the report, planned to execute clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis seeking to go to Iraq to collaborate with al-Qaeda militias that want to fight the Allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is regarded by the hardliners among the Sunni Saudis as keterical.
Al Qaeda militias view many clergymen in Saudi Arabia as cooperating with the authorities in supporting the politics of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias – accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government – have looked at foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This has been a very big effort by the security forces over the last five months," a spokesman for the interior ministry told state television.
The arrests also involved a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to advertise for the "Takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims supporting violence against Muslims marketed as disbelievers and apostates.
Among the detainees were also 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could make an outlook for the future of the Earth
Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit shows that the planet resembles a distant twin of Earth even more than previously conscious.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, conditions on Venus would have prevailed, which would have been very similar to those on Earth and could have even been habitable, scientists believe today.
But due to the unbroken carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by sunlight and a slower rotational rate, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which has been exploring the plant for a year, provide a refreshing insight into how the Earth could evolve in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: “It will be clear why the climate on Venus is so different to that of Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar.”
"Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Enriched uranium" seized by police
A kilogram of radioactive material, reportedly enriched with uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for <0x24>1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Everything still open
Mitt Romey said he does not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency eventually declared himself ready to put up a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record questions on video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night, November 28, were as ridiculous as the Snowman who questioned Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time accurately reflected the state of the Republican Party, which is breaking up in the elections next year.
It is not known exactly how the CNN producers who supported the debate with selected YouTube clips to showcase the upcoming candidates.
However, in the first half-hour of the debate, which was the longest devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
The topic is one of the most striking topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to serve a disc when they heard things they liked: The television station noted peaks of approval as the candidates spoke strictly about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who moved forward in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to stifle the reputation of being prone to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two were particularly fiercely divided as questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Unimportant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, managed to investigate the issue.
None of the two men have serious chances of nominating, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have crawled earlier and harder than others on the immigration parrot.
At least in the field of immigration, the candidates share the same views: sharper borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This topic, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic as other topics were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to believe that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the Whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – now against all expectations in a recent Iowa poll thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – said the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When he was pushed to ask if Jesus would support them, he laughed about it and said Jesus was too smart to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent donor successes and his applause storms in Wednesday's debate.
These two are out of nowhere, because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the most famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party from the beginning and convincingly unites with a victorious message about the size of America and a clinker to both sides of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to enter; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No noble titles seem to have been sold, no politician paid Parisian hotel bills, no extramarital toes have been wiped out.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has concealed donations for the British ruling Labour Party over more than 650,000 pounds (<0x24>1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something that would have worked well without the contested Gordon Brown.
When two months ago, the Prime Minister had withdrawn from the demand for an election, in a stupid way offensive to the intelligence of the British, claiming that polls did not influence this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp chairman of the Liberal Democrats, put it, the once feared Brown has evolved from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unsecured rescue of Northern Rock, a hit bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Badly thoughtful proposals to amend the tax laws have brought corporate associations against the government.
The tax authority’s loss of personal data of 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative blunders.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: to be minister of the armed forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s Secretary General (and her former Chief Executive Officer) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown irrevocably breaks the direction of resignation.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it is impossible to govern.
People do not like or trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new troop takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for a long time, this postponement is over: the public service is beginning to become and perhaps; the cabinet ministers are beginning to plagiarize; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is going to look for bad news.
In a way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new asshole.
As much as he would deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant-general.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction documents, for example, are linked to decisions that Brown made as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s mischief – as in the long “money for nobility” investigation of political party funding – voters may assume that he was.
However, Brown’s situation isn’t as bad as it looks.
The mistakes are not as terrible as the Conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one has died, or was completely deceived.
And the antidote, as painful as it may be, is to deliver what Browns of course has always promised Stalinist tendencies: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new testimony of political donations is a good example.
The garboeske of Abraham, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his well-being.
This may be true, but the decision was not up to him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he had known about Abraham’s agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour’s chief financial officer, who was told about the special donations in October.
But so far, Brown is not involved: there is no indication that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his takeover in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has completed half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he diluted this determination by grasping a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - to make the measure full, from a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to draw out" are not very complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and moving forward with a comprehensive reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly to give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions – bitter pills for a party colleague like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through undeniable fairness and solid competence.
Kartenhaie
Is the credit crisis connected to the American credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that backflows agitated to spin around.
Now that America’s real estate market is raging, the predators have the country’s credit card market in sight.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach <0x24>99 billion if the risk of contagion spreads from underfunded loans to other forms of consumer loans.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the checkouts and the salary rates, which measure the share of the loans, which are not recoverable in each case or more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it had taken a <0x24>1.4 billion tax cut from its U.S. consumer financing, partly because of the weakness of credit card holders.
It’s too early to panic though.
Losses and semen are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third-quarter seeding rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
An amendment to the U.S. private insolvency law in 2005 resulted in an abrupt fall in bankruptcy claims, which in turn accounted for a large part of the credit card losses; the number of claims (and therefore semicircular fees) would increase again, whether the general conditions for borrowers or creditors would not.
The industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of their debts consumers pay each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stagnation in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, expects spending for 2007 to be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: consumers are more likely to accept credit card debt, now that home loans are drying out.
However, card issuers look at the cash flow rather than capital, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
They can even be an advantage for card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates are declining when real estate is less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debts under the repayment priorities become more important.
Card issuers can also respond much faster and more flexiblely than lenders to stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and completely re-evaluate the loans,” said Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial reporter.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable slowdown are considerably more realistic.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more ugly future.
Keep an eye on these sharks.
British bankers plead guilty to Enron’s case
Three British bankers to be sued for their role in the fraud system with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, turned their claims into charges on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially pleaded guilty to seven cases of fraud using telecommunications means for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was initiated in January.
But during a hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during two-year delivery procedures.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
The initial allegations against them in 2002 brought Fastow to the attention that he was the target of an investigation by the government in connection with Enron’s decline.
The accusation against the bankers — called the NatWest Three — claims they came to Houston in 2000 to investigate a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron teams that helped tear the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had valued its shareholding in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under Kopper’s control acquired the bank’s shares in the subsidiary for <0x24>1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper <0x24>250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely represented Enron that the energy company would pay <0x24>20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the <0x24>20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received <0x24>7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper, and others disbursed about <0x24>12.3 million, according to the prosecution.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in Enron's pleite.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison sentence in Louisiana’s federal prison.
Kopper is sentenced to three years and a month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free on the basis of a <0x24>1 million deposit that required them to live in the United States pending trial.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh-largest company, broke bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer conceal billions of debts or make weakening businesses seem profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value, and more than two billion dollars pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were invalidated after he died last year of heart disease.
Not all the way down in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least <0x24>54 million.
But this is small money for some of the wealthy Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But none of you are asking for so many seats because it’s for a private family or a corporate president.”
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the millionaire exhibition, a four-day orgy of showcased consumption, held in a boxed exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest Russians newly made money in everything from mahogany-stained yachts to diamond-coated car grills that would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer carefully saw a shiny orange Porsche at the next exhibition stand.
"It's a nice car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
According to the United States, Russia is the second-largest market for private aircraft.
Annihilated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas in its glowing times.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to giant wealth and went to Europe in scares, where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the most visible free money issuers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in the gold rush.
A conference of the luxury industry, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, was held this week in Moscow to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, with a total of <0x24>282 billion, according to Forbes’ list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which together is worth <0x24>670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, which was created by economic experts at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert panel here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian tradesman of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
“Women are all exemplary and men are all worth a fortune.”
As they dig through the halls on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, label themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to focus primarily on the newcomers, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in the stall for several hours to visit a busy warehouse, the tasteless Appinac Escalades, Cadillac Escalades, Stampede in Platinum, Neissermeer, Möcknermeermeer.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climbers."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from big-track logos to the kind of bare brands with limited numbers of pieces that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, thousands of people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Betten here, said he had sold two <0x24>70,000 mattresses, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, told a company that equipped the high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company sold the gray orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for <0x24>170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would have three car cooling grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, the same chain-linked tyres, for <0x24>55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tyre designed for a Russian casino owner, with spikes he had covered with colorful Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette wheel.
Cost: <0x24>22,000 for a quarter.
“The Russian millionaire who wants to have an image of his wife’s face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily drive on these wheels,” said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30 or 40-car garage."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they’re probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who weren’t millionaires could at least act as if they were rich on a stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red cell phones in the British model, which were full of mountains of fake million dollar bills.
Azad Karriev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the millionaire trade fair.
Passengers stopped by tossing piles of money around, taking mobile phone photos while lying down in the middle of the alternate, letting friends cut, or just plug in a few million.
"See, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karriev said.
Suspicious Operation Suspected of Death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as a ambulance on the white Cape Cod stopped two doors further down West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another.
"Then I saw the box cart of the doctor's body viewer arrive," Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, said on Wednesday.
“That was the point when I knew someone had died.”
Authorities found out that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died from a procedure performed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who was not identified by the police and who worked in the house at West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Mrs. Arroyo’s death, and are hopeful that toxocological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help clear a mysterious death that has caused a sadness by the Newark police leadership.
Mrs. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and hardworking," McCarthy said in a phone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my Pitbull.
She was protecting me.”
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized, surgical treatment.
"That's one of the options," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not say whether Mrs. Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro’s house, where a pink rose stands in the bare foreground and a Dalmatian bells behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "ethyl vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes were hanging from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark for the first time after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable value, helping him to cope with the provincial and tough political culture in his new city.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this or that,’” he said.
“She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I went.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to the rise of world stock markets
Shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market openings that the central bank will try to calm credit markets by further interest cuts were reinforced by weakening comments by the vice president of the US Central Bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the central bank, said the policy had to respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the ongoing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm sad markets, given signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulence had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functioning from late September and October".
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rates cuts.
The statements also helped reassure Wall Street, given further bad news from the US economy, now that U.S. real estate sales reached a new record high in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence have been underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workers, in a cost-reduction measure to eliminate heavy losses from its lost stakes in U.S. loans.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13.289.40, while the broader S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of British standard values.
Germany’s Dax Index rose by 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
Earlier, the re-emergence of credit pressure on markets had been underlined after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds from the European Central Bank, which were granted to the European Commercial Banks, at a significant 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and invest more capital into the money markets in London increased as the three-month "Libor" lending rate between UK banks rose by 6.59 per cent, at its highest level since September, at its peak of 21 per cent.
England faces decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who will beat number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the election, at least under this special title, is here to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan make decisions, and because the table of High Morries, the English chief executive, is not part of such a time, which gradually for national appeal, with
Anyone who does not get the sixth batting position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to determine exactly what enables a person to reach the top of his professional career, while someone else never goes above the lowest rank, sometimes due to lack of happiness rather than ability.
It’s not just in cricket, where the choice is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective at the end.
When is the best time to visit Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, whether, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good closures who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricketer unless he is given the opportunity to swim or undergo.
Of course, figures have a big impact on decisions, but chances also do.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a wicket, and a striker must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Capturing the eyes of the voters is more complicated.
There were many who last season were better than, for example, James Anderson, who would appear to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and how the wind crawls into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their bright spots and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara play at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, however, it was Paul Collingwood, at that time still struggling to consolidate himself, who made the breakthrough to a significant test cricketer and who, although he still scores a double-dotch in a huddle, is still struggling to break through to a significant test cricket player.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and belly-feeling for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youthful enthusiasm after another discussion during today’s network session at Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six from Bopara, who is 22 years younger than seven, and an excellent balance against twisted balls.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home run as a Middlesex player, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection from the voters as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game.
On the contrary, the Essex omniscient has apparently a joy in life.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket pitch and his stance away from it was brought to the point when he had recently overtaken a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched it from a distance, and with enthusiasm to say, "Have you seen it?"
Bopara is a much better field player, he clings to his mid-tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and hits with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time for another.
Perhaps this is the actual art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn’t mean that Shah might not be good if, as the Ceylon tea set suggests, he’s the one who’s going to play here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work and Fight Al-Qaeda
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose money or visas have expired, and others hoping the city would return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels who had expelled them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operated by refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now.”
They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people,” he said, referring to the Shia militia of militant clergyman Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to return to the moment.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah summoned him to tell him that a local U.S.-backed militia helped drive al-Qaeda out of their base west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been displaced from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after calling on his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He had come back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and my boys.
That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many have been told that they have been attracted by the growing calm in the capital since the U.S. troops rose and the growth of local “citizens affected” who are armed and defend their neighborhoods in cooperation with the U.S. military.
But more were said to have been forced home by visa problems and money laundering in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister who had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country’s sectarian death squadrons.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government forced the Iraqis to give no more visas to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni retiree said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left.”
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were displaced from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have fallen.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will spark sectarian tensions again and there will be conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest state is a leader in vocational education and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in a field of education, the Saarland countries are pushing the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday, for the 50th time, I declared to a non-Saxon country that we are not French" - this slogan posts the smallest federal state self-ironically on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is ranked fifth in the educational monitor of the Institute of German Economics Cologne (IW).
In this way, the universities have been working closely with the neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But even the land children bring the Saarland to higher education in an above-average number - many of them without graduating from high school.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at IW.
More than one in five young people is eligible to study at a vocational school, making the Saarland more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are also relatively broadened.
Measured by the population, the equipment with dual courses of study is the second best in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"In the general education schools, we have undertaken several reforms after the first Pisa study," said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
This is how the government introduced country-wide comparison tests.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that now also copies other federal states.
Whether students’ performance is improving sustainably will only be shown in future comparative studies.
In Pisa 2003, the share of high-risk students decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
The Bayern are better off.
And to the detriment of the Saarlands, foreign language skills are not measured in Pisa - in this area one could point out otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbors is mandatory for high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez turns the clock
In Venezuela, the clock will be ringing differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will turn the timer back in the South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke.
According to the Venezuelan Official Gazette, according to a new law, the clocks will be set to World Time minus four-and-a-half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that there is no other country in the world.
The U.S.-enemy Chávez justified his decision, among other things, by imposing the United States of the world on the division into time zones for too long hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with neighbouring Colombia because of a ghost affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he will not have any relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would clearly expand his power in the country.
The trigger of the dispute was the decision of Uribe to withdraw Chávez’s mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which were about the release of hostages.
Uribe said Venezuela had "spoke in the face" with his decision, Chávez criticised Sunday.
Also in Spain, Chávez is in all mouths.
A new cell phone ringtone provides furore in the country: "Por qué no te callas" is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was spoken by Spain’s king Juan Carlos, who had been generated at the recent Ibero-American summit by the constant interim calls of the left-wing populist and who had driven over his mouth.
Germany threatens 2007 wage minus
Despite the strong economic downturn, German workers are facing a real wage loss this year, according to a forecast.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could actually expect less on their salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The reason for this is the modest wage development, the increase in value added tax and the price hikes in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Image" newspaper.
Employees could also face new burdens on unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent for the year-end is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Agency for Labour should not be embarrassed to have to ask the Federal for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it became known that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by 3.0 per cent in year-over-year comparison.
Venus is the Earth's Hell Twin
Despite its life-threatening atmosphere, Venus is more similar than ever thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind turbines at the poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it is flashing on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: lightning on Venus shooting at an altitude of about 56 kilometres from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles "Science in Los Angeles.
According to the famous "suppe theory", lightning has created life on Earth: storms are believed to have triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If there has ever been life there, it must have been in very early history,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, it dominates temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius.
"Venus may be the devil's twin on Earth, but it's a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has undergone such a completely different development, is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as there has been no special probe on the planet since the early 1990s.
The latest research findings, which are now presented in several "nature" articles, not only underscore the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, according to the researchers.
“They also show that our neighboring planet’s relationship with Earth is greater than initially assumed,” says Esa.
In addition to the already known wind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloudstrudel at the South Pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air flows in the Earth’s winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers about Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrophysics Spatiale and Physics Cosmica.
The second-lowest planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is nearly the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as morning or evening stars, orbits the sun in about 225 days.
But it turns around much more slowly: a Venus day takes 243 Earth days.
Although Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly resemble Earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated, which remained on Earth in the oceans, but on Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on Earth, it accounts for most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and has called on the big coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present the outside world with a split nation on this issue," Köhler told the trade paper.
At the same time, Köhler signalled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany needs to maintain sensible balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel took protection before the charge, she is running a new China policy.
“The Federal Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed discontent over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked by ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier had complained, among other things, about the "shower policy" of the Union in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor’s office, there was fierce irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
The Chinese leadership not only invited German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries, according to the SPIEGEL.
China’s Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to accept the Dalai Lama’s reception as a mistake.
China rejects it when European politicians officially receive Tibetan religious leaders, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Schwäble warns of crawls like in France
Street battles with police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of crawls like in France.
Everything needs to be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not unleash violence on the streets, the Federal Interior Minister demanded.
Barricades burned, randomisers fired shotguns at the police: After the heavy youth crawls in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
“We need to make sure that social explosives are not built up and unleashed in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the "New Press" in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The Bundes, countries and municipalities were already working with emphasis on eliminating problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, this is already the first success."
However, it is too early for warning.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had fought heavy street battles with the police in the past nights.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
More integration efforts by the federal government, however, demanded by the chairman of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Faced with the tie in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as fragile as in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Kolat noted that the unemployment rate among young people with migration backgrounds below 25 years was "over-average high".
In particular, more training spaces need to be provided.
Kolat stressed: “We need to give young people a perspective.”
The chairman of the Turkish municipality added, however, that in Germany more than in France is taking place "a social control in the families".
Many young people with migration backgrounds also did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warned, "But we still have to be careful."
It is necessary to give young people “quickly the opportunity to participate in work and education”.
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police units were in use, a helicopter overloaded the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burning garbage trucks and cars.
Since the day before, an offer of around 1000 security forces has provided rest.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
On Tuesday night, around 80 police officers were injured in crawls in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night the riots overthrew Toulouse.
The claws ignited in a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the prosecution’s first findings, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the youth.
In the Kingdom of Angela Cloude
The chancellor’s far-reaching appearance documents that the coalition is content at the end – and that nothing more is expected of herself.
In which country does the Federal Chancellor actually live?
After her relentless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was ugly and poor in content, one must say: not here - not in the country that should finally be governed by her.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she focuses too much on foreign policy with an angry overwhelming sentence.
That’s provincial, she said, showing that she doesn’t want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the Bundestag, she has clearly documented the extent of their accusations.
There was neither concrete interest nor a feeling of the problems in the country.
Instead, she introduced herself to Angela Wolken: a reluctant politician who flees to foreign policy and even stays in danger there.
For example, climate protection: It commends itself incessantly for the decisions made by Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate targets are to be achieved in this country.
Overall, the self-love - so much modesty would have failed the CDU chief even two years ago.
Now she clings to the whirlwind that the upheaval is coming to people.
In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems, rather than making the world beautiful.
But in Angela Wolken’s empire, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low earners?
She has a couple of sides left for it.
It is significant how often she promises herself when it comes to babysitting.
There are three steps that Merkel needs to take to make a half straight sentence.
It falls like on a foreign land when it becomes concrete.
Attack Division
In the Youtube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney face a tough swap – and now have to fear an outsider.
The tensions of the candidates are unwinding already on the first topic.
He has made New York a “refuge for illegal immigrants,” Romney denies his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
“I would say his own house was a harbor for illegals,” Giuliani replied, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blast at the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favors, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-directed 30-second videos that Internet users uploaded via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
“With this kind of isolationism, we have brought Hitler to power,” John McCain told his counterpart Ron Paul, who was the only one in the round demanding an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Also, Romney is heavily read by Vietnamese veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", a method of interrogation in which drowning is simulated as torture.
But the fact that the campaign’s important issues now lie beyond Iraq war and torture debates shows the reactions of the Saal public in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whenever conservative values are priced and future tax increases are rejected, applause is on fire in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
“I was wrong at the time,” Romney explains, arguing in front of base and television audiences that he was still one of the advocates for abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to mind when, in his opinion, he is asked for the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in Civil
A day after his resignation as chief of the army, Pakistani leader Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and to act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had surrendered his office as chief of the army to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani, thereby bending international pressure, in particular from the United States.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now reigns as a civilian head of state for the first time.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had met a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on November 3.
Soon after his defense, Musharraf will revoke the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, thereby fulfilling another demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after imposing the state of emergency in early November with his weighty lawyers, had rejected all objections against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four wounded in an attack on a military convoy.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Grass Dryers Return
Germany’s supergroup of the 1970s is playing music again: the three band members of Harmonia took their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
To revival, a clip from her great time "Live 1974" appears.
By that time, they were much more famous abroad.
The recommended sensation then takes place in the form of three gentlemen seated at the evening table.
Everyone has their boxes in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius thrives in a flowery white shirt at age 63 in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and in possession of laptop and guitar.
To the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, focuses on the console.
Everyone contributes noises, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band re-musiced Harmonia has provided some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
Whereas one can reveal here: Targeted queries revealed that the name was complicated by collective pop memory, but in no way so sustainable that this band has been painfully missing for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the Germans also celebrate their living legends from the 1970s?
Especially what is deceptively called krautrock has always been considered more in England and America than in our own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for life work to the survivors of the Cologne Can Group in 2003, the room was seen in questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked themselves in the Laudatio even with the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu!, the admiration knew no limits.
During concerts, Michael Rother later hopped at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and clarification abroad is one.
This is why the memory is overloaded with harmony, because the trio only existed for two years and during this time a much less power developed than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first we played in the basement under the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly worked at the Kraftwerk and subsequently played a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, the then perhaps most radical German band.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musician into exile to Forst in the Westerbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as fugitive municipalities.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was allowed to torture himself as a child.
Preferably in a high-speed artist's diet.
There was also a wimple of the Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art.
Some held harmonia to it.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because so left and the music also humbled sound, the band suffered material distress.
The rice collection was not intended for self-invention alone.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was cut at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record-breaking 50-headed track, as someone thinks to memorize.
From Rother came the desire to force harmony and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric Sphere and secured his existence with albums such as "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has been more successful since it was ever Harmonia.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record label Greenland aims to preserve the Krautrock as a true German contribution to live music.
New! was already excavated as Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical rebirth of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
The entire bandwidth of Krautrock’s influences on the following pop music would be outlined.
Harmonia fills the space of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's phrase floats with the most extraordinary sounds in the room: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures showing the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse.
The legendary design is used for projections of other black and white photographs of wired devices.
Previously, the three veterans were again engaged in improvisation.
No more by gluing microphones to the organ and drums to unlock the instruments with unheard-of sounds over self-built effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three into the technical deepened tufter.
This does not change the choir of the house.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns, she is whispered and whispered under sound clouds and in a beautiful place with an emphasis "Aaaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never a rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music schools (can), technologies (power plants) or on the escape from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Those who call here "'68!" are not entirely wrong, and harmony cannot be brought out of it now.
Even the most obvious thing is thoroughly covered on the stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob a person of nerves or give him fugitive moments of great luck.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
"The Hunting Party" and "Killer Peace" are two films dealing with the Balkan War.
But both do not convincing.
Either the concepts put too much on action and gamblers or they are too agitated.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news is that while the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, calculated there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties last because too many nice-looking roles in women’s well-being films and too many press conferences on Buddhism sparked a desire to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - If the Hunter Becomes the Hunted" (Why do movie titles always have to be as long today and we'll be like Lokführer collective agreements?).
He delivers a wonderfully eye-catching depiction: In essence, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become of Gere if fate and the film industry weren’t so kind: a man who has long had his best times behind him, but who, even as a ruinous monument of his decadence, still considers himself a ruinous monument of his decadence.
But despite this Trumpf, "The Hunting Party" and German production "Killer Peace", which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
With "Killer Peace" one can make a short process: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian from a Kosovo hedgehog, after which one quickly falls in love with her.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not even presented here as the sole root of all evil, the TV-superficial film loses itself too quickly in gameplay and action.
There is a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but for that with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be explored exemplaryly why there has never been a really good Balkan war movie.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who set up to track down the Serbian war criminal "The Fuchs" could have been a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another screenwriter (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are strikingly similar: both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something that the military can’t, and both times it becomes a journey of madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the downtrodden cynic with heart as he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also give him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the drain when reporters succeed in the last five minutes in the time-saving process what NATO, the CIA and all the world's top money hunters have failed in five years: catching the war criminals and getting the Muslims to the bosnians.
This is so bad that one wants to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the Kinology.
The film has a profoundly human concern.
He wants to report that Karadzic and Mladic are still running freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (except they should agree here) not to pursue the persecution too intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the good community and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's working table: "Compassionately, I see the swollen spiders, suggesting: how strenuous it is to be evil."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have just such threshold heads, but they suggest how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all Iraq films were Hollywood’s big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South African movie.
Almost always applies: when a star roars around the world’s crisis herds or minefields, something like “Rangoon” comes out with Patricia Arquette, “Beyond All Borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Blood Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Maybe all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it had to be decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Shindler's List".
Some films will probably still ripen - the Vietnamese works now considered classics "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" were not evenly celebrated as masterpieces.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder in real time comes home on the same two screens, even just too much about the world’s conflicts.
And that robs the screenwriters of the carelessness it takes to tell good stories.
“Being or not” or “The Great Dictator” have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how badly the Nazi regime really ruled.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good movies.
You may have to have the sarcastically distanced artistic view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's only because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust raises criticism for Olympic cancellation
The removal of the mayor from Hamburg’s application for the Summer Olympics has been heavily criticized by politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the games on the water.
But from Beust realism is highlighted in the assessment of opportunities.
The chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called a resignation "not good for the economic location".
No other project has recently unfolded as big motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, the sporting political momentum could not be sustained to the same extent.”
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, "which is based on a changed time beam".
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday remained with previous statements, according to which Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least by 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on an Olympic application, but on the German Olympic Sports Federation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sports Federation’s expected decision in early December regarding Munich’s application for the 2018 Winter Games.
“This preference means for us that we will have no realistic opportunities in the period we have thought of until 2028.”
Yet the dream was not dreamed for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This will give the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to have a chance to get caught up by burying the plans already at this time,” HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application also contradicts the statement of the Senate Chief on the occasion of a reception for the plenary meeting of the General German Higher Education Association.
Beust has called Hamburg's application for the 2015 Universiade "not as a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD-citizenship faction accused the Senate of not spending valuable time on housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has been placed on the map of Olympia and slammed the construction of housing," SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Little Grasbrook has always called for an integrated planning for Olympia and later housing use, the CDU has unilaterally put on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg at the time had triggered a lot of enthusiasm.
Hamburg, however, failed in Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes.
Who combines the terms Sweden and wooden boxes, think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol’s workbook.
Most of the ninety-nine Brillo boxes listed there in "Type Stockholm" are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968, internal researches at the Moderna Museum in Stockholm now come to a daunting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes" are also in the "Brillo-Boxes" part of the "Brillo-Brillo-Boxes" in 1995, which are also in the "Brillo-Brillo-Brillo-Brillo-Boxen" part of the "International" and the "Brillo-Brillo-Brillo-Boxen" in the "Boxen" in 1995, which is in the "Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Brun-Br
The prehistory is enclosed, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes" in New York City, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the soap powder carton "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museum in 1968 exhibited - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of brillo kists from cardboard: these were not (for cost reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cartonage factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their models, about mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol may have granted permission in 1968 to produce a few brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, but not exhibited in the Moderna Museum.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which at the time entered the art and auction history as authorised original Andy-Warhol-Brillo boxes entitled "Typ Stockholm".
Some of them have earned more than <0x24>100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later mistakenly claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 boxes of Hultén were produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museum, has also investigated three of the six museum-owned Brillo boxes from Swedish private property, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press panels were first ground and shimmered, after which they were painted with white pine oil.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, tells us that the paint was applied directly to the press pan plate with a paint roll without foundation - in addition, it is not oil, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorised by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museum, states: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion than Sampieren's material in his collection, the Mursa will become the Moderna.
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that it would follow the “severe accusations” raised in matters of soap-powder lists.
Since then, however, they have remained in unrelenting silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have resigned in a hotel in Manila, demanding the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He cannot blame bloodshed, said leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Government loyal soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under the use of tear gas.
About two dozen soldiers had been deployed in the building for hours.
About half of them stood trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillans.
He used the negotiating to suddenly settle with about 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen who were supposed to actually guard him had apparently crossed over to him and joined his memoir.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces blocked the district around the hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"The people have enough," said Trillanes.
“We call on the people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Critics of the government had called for large demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Her government has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption for months.
In 2003, Manila’s financial district was the main venue for the attempted mass shooting of some 200 military members against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after nearly 24 hours when the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14.46, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
It now holds 20.05 percent of the capital.
A acquisition had previously been speculated.
The option to increase the share of sales remains open.
The move aims to drive the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operators by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The cash house holds the shares only for a third party, it was said in the financial market.
The previous day, United Internet had already participated with almost 10 percent in the mobile broadcasting company Drillish.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were purchased by United Internet for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31.4 million.
In addition, the companies have held talks about marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile radio products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesman explained.
The two companies set up the MSP Joint Undertaking to take over the competitor Freenet.
First, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a share of about ten percent of Freenet and not make use of their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies remained open to all options, in particular to further increase their participation in Freenet AG.
The talks between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
Freenet poker, which has been around for months and is still difficult to see, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers.
The holding of United Internet and Drillish so far held 6.01 percent of Freenet shares directly.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will bring an additional 4%.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
