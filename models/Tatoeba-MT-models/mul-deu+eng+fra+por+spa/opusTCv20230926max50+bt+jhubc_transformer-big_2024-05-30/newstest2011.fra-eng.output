What's going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastries in Prague.
The newly elected CSSD mayor of the capital will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the municipal council level with their former and new ODS colleagues.
The newspaper Actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to the CSSD, namely whether they know the argot that was born in the town hall in recent years, when it was the partners of the current coalition that were running in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the political cream of Prague put in place during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is surprising that it has been discovered that newly elected people do not understand the terms well known.
At least they say so.
"Who is Valdemort?".
"I really don't know."
"I am a young man in Prague politics," reacted Lukas Kaucky, who was elected to culture to test the vocabulary of Parrain.
And as for the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example, the sense of "golf hole".
"It's the only expression of those you propose to me that I use."
Otherwise, I don't use the argot.
From the vocabulary, whose daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the Pre-Electrical Congress of the ODS, the editorial selected 6 examples, primarily those related to the Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the pastry shop, "beef nerf", "treason of the capital" and "enroll".
Three of the voters agreed to the quiz, the fourth Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth-elect Petr Dolinek has rejected the test.
“I don’t care at all about these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy are entertained: I won’t give my opinion.”
"I'm currently dealing with how we're going to understand each other as part of our programs," he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the above legend, that this is the influence of Janusek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former Mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucky and immediately adds, "But I know the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
Not only the killer Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the chosen for the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two social democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of "going to the cake".
"It's, I think, going into a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it's the headquarters of Janusek's companies.
On the same tone, Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge from newspapers rather than any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the test, there is no argot lexicon in social democracy.
“I consulted with colleagues and it turns out we really don’t have anything like that.”
"It's better to say names sometimes to use abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, president of the Social Democratic Party, which members of the Party call Hulda.
“I was called Briza at school but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” said Karel Brezina.
The daily Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for the party members or the least friendly Petit old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the election by scams during the party's sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones that allow social democrats to be employed within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda much, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in mattress law" seems to recall that Petr Hulinsky obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava police academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "sorceres", a brochure was published.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
They are rather part of the old generation, cannot work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
“Man rarely has this destiny.”
“Young women are also not judged as healthy because they participate in work and give birth to children,” said a sister who takes care of the country’s western African capital, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He edited a brochure that should help limit hunting to witches.
The case involves a hic.
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso don’t know how to read,” the Die Standard newspaper warned about the drawback of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other countries of Africa.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they had sprayed on her.
It was the BBC server who transmitted this information.
The criminals say it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual onions ignited in contact with the woman.
The oil flared, he said, when the team wanted to “hurt the woman’s bad spirit.”
The isolation of "sorceres" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted a 42-year-old Burkina Faso entrepreneur as saying, “Human mind eaters have always represented a danger,” he says.
As Burkina Faso strives to reduce witch hunting, Gambia not later than last year even saw the President himself participate in it.
"Gambian President Dzammi, after his aunt's death, launched a large hunt for witches who, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have been endeavored by the black magic to kill the President as well."
"Calls from nearby Guinea came to rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police and the President's personal guard, randomly chosen men and women in villages in Gambia," Amnesty International said in a statement.
At the farm, imprisoned people were required to drink a herbal drink with hallucinogenic effects that also caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two of the prisoners did not survive.
On international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The ponies are warming up, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out from the door of the RPG Byty customer center of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying under his arm a file with three new lease agreements for three apartments: his, his daughter and his son who is purging a sentence.
The deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2<0x2B>1 apartment of the second category 4100 crowns.
“And there’s no hot water and the heating works with solid fuel,” says the man who has the power to sign on his son’s new contract.
"But I signed anyway," he explains, infuriated and half resigned.
The citizen association of BytyOKD.cz apartments, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to apply.
But the man reacts to it with a gesture of his hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" by frowning on the eyebrows.
The region of Ostrava becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic are waiting for, whose rentals do not match the market price.
Current.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava area and it is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Right next to the door is a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is on the touch screen.
A single press and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number already starts illuminating on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a brief moment, an old couple arrives to learn about the rental, but the new rentals do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems like everywhere - demanding reparations, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving mail with new leases in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
The special shop for new rentals has been open to the public since November 18.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still on trial," he replied, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and former miners’ apartments in Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of the Parliament and originator of the Ostrava region, Lubomir Zaoralek, of the Social-Democrats, made a fairly supportive statement before the elections, and this now fills the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change a put...n board in the toilet, relieved in the introduction the man mentioned.
However, most of all, according to employees, are retirees who come to be sure they will receive a refund on the new rental price if they sign now as promised RPG in a special offer.
This is a half-return of the rental amount that will be received by the other tenants who will have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" shelf of Haviovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by the questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent it," said the employee at the grocery store.
And yet RPG poses both on its website and in the showcases of individual interviews on rentals when needed.
If both parties do not agree on the lease, an independent court will decide.
“It’s not about threats, it’s just about informing about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,” RPG said on its website.
"Here no one goes to court" thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man in the street in front of the customer center gives him a reason.
"I have 13,000 retirement crowns and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
All of a sudden, the employee feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks no one to sign and so people are waiting," she said.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, current rentals still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty company, that it is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant the main reason for the increase in anger.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with rents in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to make 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging on the ceiling in front of the paved chairs of the waiting room of Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," the screen says.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
“In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low amount of 19.66 Czech crowns per m2,” adds RPG.
Next year, the rental will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see the graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of savings in heating - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the lease increase agreement have priority.
The school is part of, too, offices have included the architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also host a mini-maternal school with everything you need - colored walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch. design employees have been able to attend.
Architectural project company Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini business school since the first sketches of the Avriopoint building.
She employed about 90 people, especially of childbearing age, and she cared that women architects and project managers could quickly return to work.
At the same time as reduced-time employment contracts, the parental school is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Thus, builders and architects have the opportunity to ally work taking care of children.
It is the employees of Arch.Design.they themselves who have envisioned this kindergarten and with the support of the management they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-maternity school is funded by the European Social Fund through the Human Resources Operational Programme and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding (amounting to 2.8 thousand Czech crowns), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and after two years to provide qualified staff as well as the start-up.
After the use of funding (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to run the mini-parent school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project took a year and it was the Economy rating company that helped make the request for funding.
Children's care is provided by qualified staff, all day a nurse and a nurse nurse take care of children. children can go to parental school without age limit but they have more than three incentives for most.
As this is a "mini-mother school" there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who are replacing.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the school regardless of the hierarchical position.
Although it is individual care and education, the mini-parental school program is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children do not just play, but quality education is also ensured - from the beginning to the preparation for school benches, English is taught.
The classroom is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can control their child at any time and do not have the stress of a delay to go looking for the children in a school away from the parents’ workplace.
Parents use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural loyalty relationship is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus listed among companies that offer a bonus of choice for recruiting new employees and are family-friendly and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The house in bones still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at Gaudi's interiors.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric saury, the staircase with a dinosaur spine and the balconies with open fish mouths.
This is the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona by the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic shapes, the house has been given the nickname of House in bones from the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present of curves, this is all that is typical for Antoni Gaudi’s New Art.
The front facade of the house unfolds its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
In a more detailed observation, we see the geometry, the rhythm and the order of thought with precision.
At night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the colors feel brighter.
The winding and torsion of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood vaguely copies the window frames, balustrades, decorative elements of the doors, the eyebrow and the lamellae.
The Battlo house, which stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number 43, was born from the construction of a house in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another all-new but quickly accepted Gaudí’s idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-family house was not thought of by Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of mosaic for the façade were born.
For the façade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work on Casa Battlo’s plans began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi Casa Mila’s house and Guell Park in which there are other works by Gaudi.
The locals named the house hot just after it was finished because of its organic forms "the House in bones".
Others, given the specific mechanism of opening the windows, called it "the house that burns".
It is said that on top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of St. George the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculpture elements of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Their inclination of 45 degrees seems strange.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not adhere to the construction guidelines of the time and did not allow themselves to be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained the city's building permit, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later the municipal council was horrified during the completion and demanded modifications.
For example, the members of the municipal council did not like that the building pillars were imposing on the public pavement.
There was never any modification, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo requested (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and in the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which you can access to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the living room and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction received in addition to new facades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi’s play with the light is also impressive, with blue and white glass tiles decorated with the courtyard and with the light wells.
The two-color game gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
Just bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark that, on the contrary, absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found it to be a lucrative business and they expanded the field of visits to the common areas and the ground floor including the roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.50; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entrance price to Gaudi’s other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic towers, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a summit: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatory frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for bed, so the mattress and the top give a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they must complement each other harmoniously in order to please a specific user.
During the choice, several things are crucial: weight, size, age, health status as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which you will place the mattress and the summit is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a country house where you do not sleep continuously, latex mattresses are not suitable because they "heat" slowly.
In addition, they have a weight greater than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain on a solid board, they retain moisture, and mold can also form there.
Habit is also decisive in the choice.
Anyone who spends the clear of time abroad where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a rambling layer, will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all the hockey players who come back from the NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
“For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a tearing layer of foam.”
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that thus misappropriately assume the "information" of the joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in padding furniture.
That’s why a few years ago the mattress with molten foam conquered hockey players as well as other customers.
"Today everything is going well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex, but also the Czech Tropico, for example, have appropriate mattresses.
You don’t need to be an NHL guy to be able to enjoy a sparkling foam.
This “miracle” works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won’t come back in the night like after a difficult game.
You just sleep better.
The foam foam also acts as a protection against squares.
For the choice of the mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman in size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm in total.
For single beds, singles, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It is convenient in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands comfortably with the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Boilers-Matelassiers and Decorators, who has been dedicated to the furniture of his mother-in-law and for several years to the problem.
For a double bed each needs its own top and mattress, so be careful when choosing the height of the mattress.
Otherwise, you will only have to climb the summit to different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, mattresses with springs at least 15 cm, so count for the layer of shape and aeration at least three centimeters.
“When touching or sitting on the mattress, you should not feel the springs,” Helena Prokopova warns.
Each mattress requires a well-determined type of summit.
The bedside table, when the mattress and the bedside table are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are very bad; you should not wash it, which is common today.
And since during the night we sweat normally from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and closed) covered.
For this reason, specialists refuse to claim a life of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But it's all his own.
And for this, a advice from the vendors: for a 120/140cm mattress, give up, for the mattress coating, hygiene or washing, but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if today it is common to manufacture coatings with zipper for the whole, that is, after the opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the manipulation for a large model can be done (and for a single person can be done) on one another.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a summit?
Never! Never!
A maximum of one bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are no) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with pocket springs (of Germany Taschenfederken) and a ventilation layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of such a bed.
For single-position laminate tops with 14/18 laminates, the latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more laminates, 28 and above, where the laminates are possible to double the laminate and the part is folded again.
For multi-position mattresses, spring mattresses should not be taken as they do not respond to change of position.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the lamellae, it is also possible to install what is called a shoulder cradle.
This is a special bond of the lamellae that allows to pressure or even incline the lamellae so that the sleeper's shoulder "integrates" well.
For men who have “shoulders as wide as the back,” this is really important.
This is already considered by the mattress manufacturers who for the "male" have begun to use a shoulder-level rambling area.
But they also think of women - they give them a softer surface on the hips again.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or plate tops with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and denies the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated air) on good mattresses and top, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians, for example, prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow should increase the height of the shoulders (with the shoulder cradle on the top or the backrest area in the mattress).
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also in organic mattresses.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as, for example, soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans exactly.
“The organic label for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products,” explains Petr Vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattresses; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavender fragrances.
There are differences between a man and a woman.
While the extract of poultry plants so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for low sex.
The current preferences?
The mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disrupted cellular structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, lower back and feet are located.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as tools for health.
In the Czech Republic, it was Gumotex who reached the first place.
Saving for the mattress and the summit is not easy.
From time to time, two mattresses may be available as part of special actions from manufacturers or producers for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory foam sewn to the lining for 11990 crowns.
Of course, the second one can be taken for free.
The era of spongy or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and a large thickness was started with the Tempur material at a "cosmic" rhythm.
This began as a matter for NASA because astronauts were undergoing the start of enormous load factors.
The Tempur returns to heat and hardens, on the contrary, to cold.
It therefore perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes it with optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against poor sleep and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve legs and the venous system.
For example, Czech manufacturers use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly being asked by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, put in place at the beginning to search for cars can also be used to track the movement of people and help in some cases such as that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a lighter box but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka has evoked a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
“We strive to tell everyone that this is not espionage but just another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of the company MAcro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of someone who is not aware of it, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
“Most people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons,” adds Pilin.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes the "box" is used and how to use it in case of an emergency.
Children's psychologist Dana Bockova draws attention that if the child does not want to wear something like this on him, he will get rid of it.
“And even the smallest ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Mobile phones, which can cut off like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long waits,” says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is very controversial.
"If it's a ready-made kidnapping, the author will do everything possible to ensure that the child doesn't have an electronic device that can locate it."
“Currently, it’s the phone.”
“As soon as the tracking devices develop, they (the criminals) will be looking for them as well because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign.”
“In such cases, criminals will always be ahead of the police,” the psychologist says.
She still admits that such devices can help in an unprepared aggression by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, it claims that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of aggression.
"The device can be set in such a way that it is in regular broadcast after a certain period of time."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
"The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and found himself in the elongated position without moving," says Cech.
According to him, so-called smartphones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special prologue.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those that are carried in pendants the size of a lighter box or to the smallest phone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, that is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he will realize it after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to track cars.
It is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (used commonly in self-navigation) and a cell phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating ropes that it could go around the Czech Republic with, but it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of cords used for explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence had purchased 224 kilometres.
The military has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the cords is a maximum of two to four years.
The army purchased detonating cords from the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff has given as a reason for the acquisition of a huge amount of detonating cords to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations made by the military pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it is apparent that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household staff should have an explosive exercise every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating cords.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the army's reserves could support it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is enough more than 2 m of detonating cords, as experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - also with the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for 225 years.
However, the soldiers of the rapid-intervention brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they almost did not have ammunition for their guns and that the shooting sessions were limited due to the need for money.
There is no mention of the lack of body linen.
"And I don't take my head off if they buy so much detonating cords from us."
"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
“For us, the military is a good customer that we as merchants strive to satisfy,” says Jan Deckey, STV Group’s commercial director.
Jan Pejsek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, argues that hundreds of miles of detonating cords have been seized by the military for 10 years.
Jan Deckey of STV Group reports, however, that the lifespan of the detonating cords and the pyrotechnicians of the police and the army is only two years.
"If they're perfectly stored in the depots, it can last up to four years," says one of the two who doesn't want his name published in view of criticism from the army.
The life span of the past, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains integral and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said Pejsek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence's buyers.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cords by police pyrotechnicians neutralizing the ammunition from World War II or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for pyrotechnicians' safety reasons and to be able to further flexibly obtain more modern and more reliable types of detonating cords.
the Ministry of Defence today has major problems for the neutralization of dozens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the strong Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, towards the Rhine.
What awaits this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted in a few years is to neutralize hundreds of miles of old detonating cords that it buys "cheaply".
So far I have benefited from the contacts I have obtained through the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the contest of the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of last year’s Best Individual Entrepreneur Competition was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His journey to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberec there was a lack of a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 half-demolition apartments.
Knowing that he was still a student in his thirteenth year of higher education, it was a bold action.
“The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region gave me a desire to do something,” says Lucas Pytloun.
He started renting the first rebuilt apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building that he transformed into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has allowed him to open in Liberec 4 guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of almost 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year another one of the same quality came to him.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other Pytloun hotels franchise candidates showed up," the number 1 entrepreneurs of last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the commissioning of a large-scale hotel the victory in the entrepreneurship competition of the year has served well," adds Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me in the streets, congratulated me often and, I have to say, it was very nice,” he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who strive to do something.
There is no need to win, but every opportunity to be visible is good.
He says that he still uses his contacts and knowledge that he could not have obtained in another way.
"With those I met through the competition, I started to maintain business relationships regularly.
According to him, the reputation associated with success has also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
“I observe in their homes above all the loyalty and pride of being committed to something that has been generally recognized.”
“It’s not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the meaning of the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind it.
The one who came to get the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the Company of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tooling workshop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged my employees but also my employees and increased our self-confidence to fight the competition,” said the winner of last year’s competition.
At the beginning of the history of the Farmet company there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of the goods by the communists, he did not hesitate for a long time, refused a career in a firm where he was working at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his factory for the pulpit.
Not long after they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even to the non-specialised public after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
“Not only did our customers really get to know the Farmet brand better, but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they are collaborating with a company that has achieved the greatest success in its home country,” says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year has not only happened in Farmet in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the economic results of 2008 and partly 2009.
And it was precisely in 2009 that this was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their shortcomings with new materials and technologies.
“Obviously, we did not escape this situation.”
“Revenue has fallen by 40 percent, and we have to limit our production and even fire it,” says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and retained beneficial results even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
At Farmet, however, they continued to invest uncompromisingly in research and development.
“We built with the grants a training and research center, strengthened the company’s presentation at international exhibitions and won the main awards at national exhibitions,” says Zdarsky.
It all makes us think that the crisis is behind them.
The number of claims goes up and with them the number of employees as well.
“To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere,” says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes nonsense regulations.
The Absurdity Investigation of the Year is part of the business clan for the fourth time.
Some absurd regulations could have been deleted.
The poorly glorious winner of this year’s Absurdity Inquiry was the obligation to bring to the offices the documents that officials can get online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the Social Affairs Administration required a paper extract from the trade register while the official can get it in two mouse clicks.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
“The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer ask for the extraction of the trade register for insurance payment controls,” said Jana Buranova, a spokeswoman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To bring out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fulfill in the Czech Republic and to remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this year's Absurdity contest.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If 3,000 voters took part last year, at least 4,000 voted this year.
And it’s not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only make the business slow down, and,that, more and more.
“We may be in the number of documents to fill out for tax returns in the world’s top spots,” says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared with the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic does not improve at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of conditions for the company, which is 8 more than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year Competition was first established in 2006 and continues every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report every year of administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to late September, the last time before the closing of the contest.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the organizer selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.hined.cz.
The absurdity that received the highest number of votes is declared the winner.
Until last year’s last survey, there were a hundred, or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees that had lost their sense of existence.
The remarks are sent by entrepreneurs as well as trade unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, so among the nominees is, for example, the obligation that motorway and highway maintenance vehicles pay fees, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the website of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which always begins in early November on Venceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
“Economic prosperity can’t work when the state puts bullets in the legs of entrepreneurs and that’s why my goal is to remove at least three dozen paragraphs every year that today only make the business complicated,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Commerce.
Efforts to suppress absurd decrees are not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days in advance to the office for the individual company at the location of the company, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Individual Entrepreneurship Act.
The second most plebiscite obligation in 2007, which was to declare the Bureau of Labour a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee, was removed with the text of the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything is ok until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training or sporting projects are evaluated.
This year’s new Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has been in existence for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the Year 2010.
The objective of this competition is to support a reasonable and fair business.
“We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their business on the environment and conduct socially responsible activities,” says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile operator, the Vodaphone firm, which is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the year’s contest for the rebel.
For this first year of this subcategory of the company’s competition of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodaphone, the companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term goal for the company were registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the object of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be regarded as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this applies to persons with disabilities and to the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic is not the Prague Prologues company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor to the donation fund for 17 years that sponsors children with disabilities.
The old paper manufacturing plant in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of it, has been awarded the title of the company Responsible for the Central Bohemia region and has been ranked third in the region by the Fir Concours.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which has won for introducing softened working hours and even reduced to 35 hours per week on average and, this, without, proportionally, a reduction in wages.
The jury also awarded it the title because it primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports a dictionary activity in the vicinity and cares for the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment,” says Miluse Ryznarova, the company’s executive director.
The responsible IT company Enlogit of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and set them up for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the foundation Man in the Shadow that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the company's representative.
Last but not least, also for its activities, is a Lavage and Cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of a bonus above the standards.
“In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased qualifications and leisure,” says Joseph Strapac of the construction company of Bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravian-Silesian region.
They were automatically enrolled in the Responsible Company category, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone Company of the Year contest, who had responded to questionnaires attached to the document for enrollment and sent it back to the organizer before August 15.
Wrong or incomplete responses in the questionnaire were removed from the contest by the organiser.
“If the representatives of the leading firms had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the contest of the company Responsible but were not disqualified from the ‘principal’ competition of the Vodaphone Company of the Year.”
“Independent registrations are not possible because this is a subcategory of the Firm’s main competition of the year,” says Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison&Rose.
At the Plzen Land Fund, police made arrests during a public contest
In the Plzen Land Fund building, the anti-corruption police have carried out arrests in recent days.
The detectives passed the handles to the local entrepreneur and merchant by real estate Lubos.
The latter had endeavoured to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a refund application in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a particular candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for initiation offence in the context of a tender and a public contest," said Pravo's attorney general Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to provide further investigations.
After 24 hours, the police released the 46-year-old entrepreneur.
To find out how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate given so little official information.
In a Pravo question, Lubomira Cerna, a spokeswoman for the Land Fund, said police had actually arrested Plzen in a separate workplace during the public contest.
"It was a client and in no case an employee," she said.
The public contest, according to Cerna, is called “Application to Propose Rights for Land Transfer under the Land Act” and is set up when several law-entitled candidates appear.
"These people propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to recitals which must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a rank of buyers is established and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," the Fund's spokesman said.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information about the persons who had signed up for the call and as he is himself, also, a beneficiary because having purchased a large number of refund rights, he had proposed to the field candidates not to participate in the contest.
And it was probably due to the fact that he retired.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his appeal.
Lubos G. had contacts far above the standards at the FdT (Fields).
It was in the case of former FdT chief Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted for publishing lands for which the decision to set up a construction had already been issued.
For example, Lubos G. had obtained land for the construction of public communications, concretely in the place and place where the access artery to the Borske Pole industrial zone was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it would risk putting the construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households will pay an extra one hundred crowns per month for housing.
Households will have to pay a surcharge from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rentals will also increase.
Families will therefore have to withdraw from their wallet up to a hundred crowns a month more than they are now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some locations you will have to pay up to a tenth more for the water supply, and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be close to 100 kroner annually for households in apartments.
However, all suppliers have decreased electricity prices because of the sensible development to encourage the production of renewable energies, in particular photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at a time when people need it most to heat up and therefore have the greatest consumption.
It is also possible to count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
These are mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 more crowns per month, the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 crowns per year.
For residents of Prague, a 9 percent increase in water and sanitation is being prepared in case the city increases infrastructure leases.
If rentals don’t change, Prague will pay an extra 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest compared to the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increases by 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices will rise substantially in the 450,000 apartments rented from January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns almost 2,500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by the company.
Regular rents people pay in nearly 300,000 apartments could increase by 10 percent next year.
The Czech children relax with rum and Fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts smoothly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally the best brand of whiskey are stolen from parents.
These are the drinks that most often bring those who saturate themselves, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in the hospital for relapse do not make the exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to the admissions of children's departments in hospitals.
“Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be sauté.”
"The trend is really strong alcohol," says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the children's department of the Horovice hospital in central Bohemia.
“When they manage to squeeze a bottle of dad in the closet, it’s sometimes whisky, but it’s the fernette and vodka that prevail.”
“Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not feel it,” the head of the department explains.
Eva Jurinova, spokeswoman for Motol Hospital, also gives him a reason.
"In general, it's rum or Fernet."
“It’s nowadays fashionable alcohol, especially in elementary schools.”
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the head of department Pélikan, seeing drunk children aged thirteen to fourteen in hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice last year, he was in Motol where he spent exactly ten years in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from wide areas who were completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times.
“She started her career at the age of twelve when she was brought with 3.5 for a thousand alcohol in the blood along with a mixture with ecstasy,” the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
“What’s interesting is that it didn’t seem strange to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours,” the Department Director said.
It is precisely the disinterest of parents or their unusual tolerance in the face of the fact that their rejection of the drink is the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to experts, however, we are not talking about dependence, in its strict sense, for children.
“Alcoholic vocabulary means a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that is not found in children.”
“For those who use repetitive cholesterol, this is a significantly unfavourable socio-family background,” said the head of the Pélikan Department.
According to the spokesperson Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
They are integrated into statistics only in cases with a gravel intoxication requiring hospitalization.
Drunk children who are brought home after emergency care by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit down and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, Pelikan says there are three seasonal waves with which one can count: witch day, Saint Sylvester and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink despite poor results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course I lived on witch's day an admission of seven drunk kids at once," Pelikan said.
The drunken child who spent the night at the hospital under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffers from the "wooden stool" the next day.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off because they have an excellent evening and then a gentle awakening and nothing hurts them."
“They are only surprised at where they are,” Pélikan adds, knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and hospitalization on intensive care beds can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
“From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to pay off a single evening,” Pélikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regression management, which should recover from parents the burdens related to care, do not deal with cases of drunken children.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, for which the Ministry of Defence exchanged transport aircraft Casa C-295M, took off on Tuesday for Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time this type of aircraft has become the property of someone other than the Czech Army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were so far in service in the Czech army and were in flight.
The remaining Lestrois aircraft are single-seater versions of the L-159.
These are currently stationed at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Department of Defense's press department, the physical departure of Vodochody's aircraft is currently unknown.
"The L-159 single-seat planes planned for the exchange have been taken on long-stored planes without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The L-159 T1 two-seaters were exchanged in the state," he told Pravo Pejsek.
He played that the army would not be left without two seats since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 single seats into two seats.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS has committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
“The contract clearly states that the one that takes into account the L-159 aircraft is EADS and that they will be used to train pilots from NATO member countries.”
"It is therefore the case of the one who considers how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was completed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Department of Defense has not launched a bid and has contacted EADS directly.
The defence leadership argued that the exchange ensures future exports of the L-159 overseas.
The Czech Army bought 72 aircraft at Aero Vodochody and only uses 24 of them, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will likely have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission brought a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected as part of a European tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the latter is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the annular is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the index longer than the annular are at a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This can depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative finger length serves as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men before 60 years," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo the prostate cancer test, particularly by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed with her colleagues in the UK more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index of the right hand shorter than the annular.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had the same length of fingers, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the annular risk, however, fell to 33 percent, for men before the age of 60 the risk decreased to 87 percent.
The length ratio of the two fingers cited - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular the different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is just testosterone that helps in the development of prostate cancer.
Prof. Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of the study, but it does not appear to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer is “completely demonstrated.”
The Czech Republic is in the snow, the highways D1 and D5 are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is this Thursday morning covered with snow.
On the roads and sidewalks, there is most of the time of compact snow, clearers have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometres in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno in the direction of Prague undergoes the same fate.
The Automotive Central Club (UAMK) dispatcher told the news
At the 91th kilometre a truck was injured, at the 93th two heavyweights were hit, the accident injured.
Several cars were also found in the gap.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks were hit there.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at the 190th kilometer or go to Brno and then enter at the 182nd kilometer at Kyvalka.
A row of cars of several kilometers formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, car rows are created in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also closed.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams take a delay, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and the Place de la Paix (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Major is still to be reunited.
The railroads and the airport also have problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove 7 high-speed connections due to the snow.
The lines, for example, from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travelers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from Wednesday 11:00 a.m. at night until 5 a.m.
Most routes in South Moravia are already rolling but doubling of vigilance.
On the road of Vyskov, three side roads are impractical, on the road of Brno it begins to be there by places of snowstorms and on the road of Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain communication paths in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected places.
So far the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, you may need to send snowflakes and snow strawberries.
We can't estimate at the moment when they'll be rolling.
On the road to Hodonin caution is rigorous in the area of the White Carpathians.
On roads that are, given the protection of nature, maintained only by the spray of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warning CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell most in northern Bohemia, with often up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the region of Moravia-Silesia, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
In the Czech Republic, the snow gradually disappeared.
Americans Have a New “Smart Weapon”
The U.S. military sent a new “intelligent” weapon to Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25 code.
The generals think that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and “will change the game” for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise cannon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special ammunition of 25 mm caliber developed for this rifle and containing a highly breaking explosive, actually works as small grenades.
The ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall, or a gap.
It is also not protected from above and when a deadly rain of steel sparks falls on it, it can also put it out of the fight.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtains a precise target point, according to which he corrects his target site and relies on relaxation.
"Let's say you targeted at 543 meters."
"When you press the relaxation, the gun loads and shoots at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 displaced jobs
The Fujitsu Group moves its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year, in July, 400 employees will transfer their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located in the office building at Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu moves its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday by the giant specialized in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on Marienbader Square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, immense complex of Nietzsche offices in the Francfort area.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term, the group is expected to assemble 100 more jobs still scattered in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and Astro Park’s open-air offices are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Chief Executive Officer Bernd Wagner said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with a remarkable infrastructure."
He claims that the connection to the airport is precisely of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region yesterday aroused the joy of the winners and caused the losers to be disappointed.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said once again that a "planetary actor" had thus been conquered.
It is an “extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation.”
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its deployment is an important boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The Board of Directors informed the municipality of this intention very early.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," Korwisi said.
However, friendly relations could not have changed anything to the difficulties of the computer manufacturer facing the owner of the Marienbader Square building.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding that such an exceptional place remains unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the Plaza de l'Hôtel de Ville building, used so far by the Fujitsu company and the neighboring "small vertical", as well as the rest of the Marienbad Square buildings, were part of the controversial construction project of the thermal station.
As a result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the City Hall. This raised many criticisms, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces that used to be part of the parking spaces, but also because of the
In 2001, the investment rating and advisory company Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved to the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt Immobilien-Chancen Group bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group, headquartered in Tokyo, is considered to be the world’s third-largest provider of IT products.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has far more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, is home to, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronics and Electrotechnical Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Internet service provider Amazon has expelled the site specialized in disclosing confidential documents from its servers.
This attitude may be hiding from political pressures after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
Wikileaks founder, Assange, apparently resides in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is increasingly attacked.
The group of cyber activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is being sought by Interpol, is likely to stay in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excludes Amazon server."
“Freedom of expression in the country of freedom,” cyber activists said Wednesday at the source of the revelations via Twitter.
Earlier, the cyber company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the release of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber activists made use of the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the greatest number of accesses to documents.
Wikileaks continued on Twitter: “Fantastic, our dollars are now being spent on caring for people in Europe.”
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN, citing the office of Mr. Liebermann, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman’s employees.
The chairman of the Senate Commission for the Protection of Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, the British newspaper The Guardian reported.
“I wish Amazon had taken this action earlier given Wikileaks’ previous publications of classified information,” the senator said.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on the other countries to refuse the use of the servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, monstrously and scrupulously, putting our national security at risk and life-threatening all over the world," the senator said in a statement.
“No company conscious of its responsibilities, whether it’s American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks disseminate the content of stolen documents.”
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is being sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the Interpol list of people sought.
According to the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently called intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the prosecutions undertaken against him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats were made against the site.
"Calls have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why Assange is particularly afraid for his security,” Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly reacted to the statements made in North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican Governor Mike Huckabee has demanded that WikiLeaks's disclosures be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, government adviser Stephen Harper said on television, ironically, that Assange should be “killed” and that Obama could “use a drone.”
Meanwhile, there was a controversy between the White House and Mr. Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and disclosed to diplomats any activities.
“I don’t know exactly why we need to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website.”
The U.S. government has now completely passed the protection of its databases to the trial bank.
According to a White House statement, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Counter-Terrorism Center, was appointed responsible for combating leaks.
Mr. Travers is in charge of implementing "necessary structural reforms" made indispensable after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they are ever threatened by Wikileaks revelations.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course organized for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Actually, where does all the ice come from?
The Glacier and the Ice Machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the somewhat outdated ice confectioner, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice making.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated display with a spatula, disposes it in the wafer and then starts selling it.
To find out, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice, can not avoid "Gelato-University" from the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of sorbetières founded the University of Ice Cream in 2003 so that the ice creams coming out of its machines meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day initiation course organized for future glaciers was a huge success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
There are also special courses on chocolate ice that extend over several days, as well as practical sessions in the private glacier.
In the middle of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk realizing their burning desire on smooth ice.
This time, there were 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, an artistic education professor from California, is proud of the Slow Food movement and wants to propose a quality European product in the industrial ice country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is an advisor in business management and after a few years, she wants to draw something unique from this challenging job for the nerves.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housewife came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The glacier master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
It is crucial not only the right flavor, but also the silky flexibility and the right consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats up to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
It then opens a valve installed on the machine: it produces a white pasteurized base cream, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately asked: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one give free course to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against the fact that he is misled by the spirit of time.
He who speaks only of ice creams "made from natural ingredients", may have used in spite of this stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example guar seed flour obtained from guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to make ice without the use of a stabilizer, it only needs to be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will crumble nothing but ice pellets.
Some modifications of the base mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the flavours.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit ray or confectionery of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
"the suppliers will all try to fill you with dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruits.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it, becomes a yellow cream and, when added cocoa powder, forms the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and garlic with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less flavor of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice cream are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purée: from the point of view of taste, this is absolutely not better.
Nut ice does not necessarily contain the taste of the nut, when it consists largely of nuts.
Kiwi ice cream, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a balanced mixture correctly picks up the taste of an ice,” says Luciano.
Making ice is a calculation exercise: if you use fish puree with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar needs to be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is necessary for lemon ice.
Luciano presents an appliance with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the vineyards use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make calculations easier.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as it used to be.
It is not only the basic mass automatic manufacturing machine that helps.
There is also a device in which the ice mixture is simultaneously bent available to make it onctuous and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all automation, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo barked with pure fruit from the head to the feet and, thus, bursts out his study comrades when control of the colossal bowl blender escapes him.
According to Master Luciano, “an incident like this is likely to occur during each class: it is only a matter of time.”
Controllers in ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experiencing the cultivation of genetically modified plants has nudged the European Food Safety Authority.
This allegation is now formulated by the Testbiotech expert group which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we’re well informed,” Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, told Munich on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that the chairman of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other Efsa experts are under contract with the pressure group Ilsi.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has contributed decisively to the development of the EFSA testing requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The developed requirements correspond, by paragraphs, textually to the positions of the pressure group Ilsi and thus bear the trademark of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities established in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior executive of the EFSA recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period.
Recently, even the Radio of Central Germany (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relationships between the European Union's supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which raised suspicions of both the European Environment Agency and the Federal Environment Agency.
However, the EFSA does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, is being exploited as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of the EFSA are not prohibited from contacting this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the United States-based International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi).
This body is considered a neutral forum that brings together experts who, among other things, belong to the field of science, industry and politics in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the expense of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feed trials and that the environmental impact of these plants has not been tested.
“We want to know, for example, what are the incidences of genetically modified corn cause in the field,” says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only the isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not yield reliable results.
"If we don't look at the risks, then how can we find them?" asks Mr. Then in a tone of charge.
That is also Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
She has been conducting research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are hardly any researchers who are not affiliated with companies.
In the opinion of the companies, critical studies would not be published.
Mrs Hilbeck says that "industry controls security research".
The Trace of Stone
Uli Gsell got it, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of the Stuttgart train station with her tube on her back.
There was a manifesto.
He was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had arrived and had begun to demolish much of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Several thousand people protested against the S21 project, the transformation of the Stuttgart Central Station into a multi-billion-dollar underground station.
Much of the wing was in ruins when protests resulted in construction work being stopped.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Crailsheim Muschelkalk (the shell limestone), a soft and rough pavement poorly constructed between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
There were a few fragments of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He says with enthusiasm: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He claims that by cutting it off the saw, he smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he's going to do about this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The traces of the Stuttgart Stones lead to a former ammunition depot of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man trades old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition that occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were broken down or disappeared in the sewer," he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He said he was the subject of insults and threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the 80 kilograms average stone parallelpipeds with a value of between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a memory while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half of them are still in the woods, the rest being sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and took everything they could get into the trunk and trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mauernle" or limitations of herbal plates.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Mr. Rongen.
"I had this political component."
He enters his car on any ground, making the tour of his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He did law studies that he abandoned. Later, he began to study biology before becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a career.
And an amateur of stones.
It stores 40000 tons.
He amassed treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's freaking out.
Sandstones carved with art are placed on the snow.
"Once upon a time, they were part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden".
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes through the forest.
It shows a bunch of fingers: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe railway station.
And so on.
"Joli travertin."
The parallelpiped was once part of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of the stones and stories, the Cannstatt travertine from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from the St. Blasien Cathedral, the tuft from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were once hand carved and moved with simple levers and carts drawn by cattle, he becomes quite respectful.
“It would be a scandal if such a legacy was put in place.”
He did not become rich, even less rich.
But today this carrier employs 14 people. In addition, stone cutters, a sculptor, a forger, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
“We’re working hard, but it’s rewarding,” says the waste recycler.
Soon he will be going to Cologne.
There are also rocks to be saved.
Struggling Talents to Conquer High Potentials
The counter has a vivid affluence.
16 students go out to buy small salmon breads, tomato sauce and white breads.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the Volkswagen automaker invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of some sort of idea contest, they have to talk business about the car of the future with VW designers, and, by the way, get to know the Volkswagen company.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go body-to-body in the competition to find better brains and engage, like Volkswagen, in multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most skilled graduates in the amphitheaters as much as possible before they reach the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements on the performance of their students, they are trying to identify outstanding talents in the context of practical projects and to be loyal to them.
On the second day of the workshop held at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group loves the talents.
A young staff lady shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs for young talents; she shows them the ways to access the group’s premises.
It is Nico Selle of Braunschweig Technical University who is responsible for the project engaged with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
“As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know students, look closer at serious candidates and appreciate those who are online as a collaborator.”
According to M. sele, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive with which we're trying to attract students.
“In the past, the emphasis was rather on the professional project,” says Mr. Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of the new graduates will become much harsher.
In property in the sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting on a candidate cyril.
But they must boast of their reliability and, above all, shorten the highly skilled workforce.
It is mainly the graduates from the engineering fields who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineer positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI's forecast, the vacuum for engineering positions will increase further.
Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, an audit firm, accounting expertise and advisory.
It organizes costly talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise, a kind of paper rally where competitors have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the United States in this way.
Participants can accessively visit KPMG subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The participant must decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Dykta, the means used to search for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race."
“For us, a simple cruise was too little.”
For the talent hunter who is Mr. Dykta, the count seems to be there.
"Until today, we have remained in touch with all the people who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their applications to our company soon," he says.
Outside of the direct hospitality on the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises perform in a completely classic way by attending professional fairs where they engage in brain hunting.
"We try to reach graduates by participating in professional fairs."
"For example, at the solar technology show," said Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, a photovoltaic panel manufacturer.
This company based in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs. Stübe was aware of the issue of the case.
Currently, 35 positions are placed in the competition on the company’s website.
"At this time, it's very difficult to provide vacancies."
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he says.
Another way to establish contact is to go through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to perform professional internships or to write his or her final study project at us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced by solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized ambience, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a large group can't do that," said Stübe, chief of staff.
For a long time now, money has no longer played a major role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotional opportunities are the other decisive factors.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honorary table for German employers.
To this end, he asks employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and context while looking at the employee’s framework conditions.
Staff chief Ms Stübe hopes that this placement will increase the image of the company among jobseekers.
“I think that candidates are mainly referring to external assessments of a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from DEBA (Deutscher Arbeitgeber Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
It advises its customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first and foremost taking internal action.
“The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through his own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own staff.
"Satisfied employees form the best messengers."
When they treat their employees well and identify with the company, they only advertise their employer with their friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” says Kriegler.
Obama puts a stop to new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, southeastern state of the United States, in the coming years.
The Washington government has issued an equivalent ban and thus definitively repealed its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains for the time being prohibited.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform that led to this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with this accident that cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to allow for new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents of this solution want to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who bears the responsibility of the devastating black tide in the golf course is not, until now, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing multi-billion-dollar claims, is at the heart of the accusations.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is expected to present its conclusions in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar had lifted the ice from the drilling decreed after the platform exploded.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself following numerous corruption allegations, is currently undergoing deep reforms.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would remove the tax niches from gas and oil groups.
The actors in this sector have now publicly warned that the supply of food in the Gulf would be considerably lower than it has been so far.
"The government's goal is to put a stop to the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector," according to a current survey conducted in the sector by the BDO audit firm, ahead of the drilling ban on Wednesday.
In addition, the American Enery Alliance regrets the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: “Nobody knows exactly what will change with regulation.”
Investments granted in new support projects have been postponed to new order, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing into the rivers is oiled brown; it releases a smell similar to that in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed the country of Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men are living from theft, corruption and refining of oil.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't get exhausted," the environmental activist told reporters to calm them down, "you still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian attempted to photograph a young man pushed into the mud water up to the chest, as well as the greasy pull that surrounds him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the flash of water in the color of the rainbow.
It cannot be seen that the basement is filled with brown oil blankets.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells us that she used to collect shrimps by whole seals here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters have completely tari.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil came from an oil pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the nearby small town of Bodo are now required to return for six hours to reach the fishing waters: The Ogoni country in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the pests jumps to the eye when you walk through the mangrove meadows traversed by streams of water.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat squeezes a crunchy brown water, and whoever dives his hand into it removes any oil coating.
The small roots of the mangrove emerge from the ground like slippery sticks. The isolated palm trees sadly let their palms hang.
The clouds of birds are sought in vain, as is usually found in the wetlands: Since the outboard engine stopped, a ghostly silence fell on this former paradise that resembled a gas station by the smell it unleashed.
“What’s happening here is war against the environment,” says Celestine Akpobari in a sad air: “Our lives are characterized by a permanent danger to health.”
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battlefield besieged for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers penetrated here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. this was carried out much later in this region for its activities.
Today again, the return to the country of Ogoni is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometers of oil pipelines in the entire Delta region, too large this location is three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields in the Ogoni region are inflatable.
Every few hundred meters rise in the water of steel trenches like bizarre sculptures: The heads of drill holes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most are rubbed by corrosion to the pointer.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks down from time to time as a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to the experts, more than two billion litres of oil spilled over the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that flowed into the sea during the crash of the super-oiler "Exxon Valdez" was 21 years ago in the environment, more than a year ago.
Who should be responsible for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, the sabotage and siphoning of oil pipes is responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, while environmentalists consider the explosions of drillheads and perforated oil pipes as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner blamed the Shell group for applying less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of conduct failure is “much higher than mild.”
Some forms emerge from mangroves to a place that, seen from afar, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of camouflage and installed outdoors: They are completely naked and covered with camouflage to the neck.
A fire sparkles under one of the many tunnels that are sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without a motif on the site must be repeated: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the tunnel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
At first, the gasoline enters a container by passing through pipes, then at the end of the pipeline the kerosene droplets fall and finally the diesel is obtained.
That’s how Michael and his four employees produce four 300-litre diesel tanks daily: “This brings us 34,000 Naira,” about <0x24>22.
Delta residents benefit from the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than the ridiculously low 40 cents per liter of Diesel: Because they buy their raw materials for free.
This is offered by the "protectors" who put the pipeline network in perforation throughout the country of Ogoni. According to experts, the country in this way loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small fraction of the material temporarily stored is illegally purified: The networks of organized crime that also include high-ranking politicians and military members, charge the lion’s share in tankers and braddle it on the global market.
The activist Akpobari believes that the debate on whether to attribute environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or the laxist mode of production is purely academic.
“If oil companies weren’t perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen’s lives weren’t so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no robbery and illegal refineries.”
But, in the meantime, Ogoni relations especially with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was no longer a matter of withdrawal from the group. "Maybe operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will turn out to be better."
Then, Michael gets nervous.
"It's a great time for you to sneak up," the rugged oil worker announced.
“Soldiers can appear at any time.”
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at the very least they will offer them pots-de-vin.
Even soldiers mainly from the north of the country want to enjoy the raw material like all Nigerians.
"In any case, this shitty thing has made our country very low," Akkori regrets.
Investigators discover construction flaws in A380 reactors
The A380 is clearly suffering from a major security issue.
By examining an aircraft that carried out an emergency landing, the investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactor."
Qantas airline now wants to file a lawsuit against the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, Airbus passengers belonging to Quantas had apparently been more fortunate so far: During the investigation carried out, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft had a possible problem with the A380.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue bumps and leaks at the connection level of the oil pipeline, according to a statement published Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a “catastrophic failure of the reactors.”
The reactors are manufactured by Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
The Airbus of Quantas, which had to land in Singapore on November 4, was among them.
The Australian airline has now filed a lawsuit against the British reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court headquartered in Sydney, giving her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas director, Alan Joyce, said his company would claim damages in relation to the incident in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, oil inflammation is the cause of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue is considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned parties.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the airline Quantas had immobilized its entire A380 fleet on the ground for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa has replaced the reactor of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The two-story aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall across the entire territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany grey: By ice temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per spot.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked on a permanent basis, but they were unable to get through the snow that continued to accumulate.
In addition, violent rafting swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Bureau of Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal tides to take place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow accumulations on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That’s why the bad weather warning plant Meteomedia announced the violet alert level was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it’s the highest level.
In some places, 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell that the strong and cool winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the country of Saxony-Anhalt, police have announced serious road disturbances.
On the A2 highway, snow and wind resulted in a traffic interruption and caused stoppages.
In Thuringe, snowfall hit highways A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, severe disturbances in rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, trees falling on railways, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, the inter-regional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt his journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the train’s 165 passengers with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds have swept the roads.
The snowfall has resulted in numerous flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a standard spokesman and flight information, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport said 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that there are no more passengers stuck at the airport, despite this barely 400 beds are available there.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car crashed on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce the good news: The snow will always be soft and powdery, but it will thunder in case of mild thunderstorms.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by violent and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, up to less than 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to news reports, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could carry up to 500 million Euros.
Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group’s headquarters: Twin towers located in the business district have been modernized; in the meantime, bankers have had to return to their former location of service.
From now on, the financial group is obviously looking to recover the renovation costs and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, according to the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper, citing a spokesman.
This spokesman did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
“We’re checking whether it’s more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to put them back for rent at a later time.”
This is how the largest financial institution in Germany has already surrendered its seat, shortly thereafter.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for an amount of EUR 272 million from the holders of equity funds and had subsequently been rehabilitated.
Changes in energy optimization have, according to some indications, accumulated around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector estimate the value of the towers, renamed "Green Towers", to around 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be re-sold to a bank-owned fund or an independent investor.
Thousands of people are crying to the minors who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have had a thought for buried minors who have been declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
The bodies had not yet been recovered because the security situation of the well damaged continues to be precautionary.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the damaged well, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue teams were able to descend into the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that the minors had no chance of survival.
So far, the bodies could not be raised.
Today, parents and friends organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a sparkling sun in Greymouth, south of the island of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothes and surfboards, also had their place.
The flags were placed in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees at the commemorative party that New Zealand has nurtured the hope that the minors will return to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pits, said he cannot resign to accepting his son's death until he saw his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin also buried in the first explosion on November 19.
The rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the island of South New Zealand.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles told reporters that when the explosive gas mass is moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter film an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the ancient genre through his film, "Walhalla Rising", epic of the fighter.
In what audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about filming Wallalla Rising?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is made prisoner; he frees himself from his beard and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for the young male spectators soressa, that he is waiting for our bloodthirsty action.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the borgne says no word about his real name. Even the other characters escape, at least, by one or two sentences, a few terrible cries of agony.
Otherwise, we say nothing and celebrate in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the decor of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
This would be ideal for more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travelling.
When a film targets multiple target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn has been regarded, since the release of "Pusher", as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantin drug dealer trilogy, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the cinema.
Most art cinema sympathizers must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and to the intestines.
Action movie lovers die of boredom, when the borgne boards, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by the calm and fog before the crew continues to err.
It is therefore not surprising that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributor in Germany and exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the beautiful images of misery that have deserved some attention, but also because the image of a palpable film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not a dialogue in this film, or a coherent action, it is all ambient, a feverish dream turned into a film.
The spectator cannot escape.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a sluggish soundtrack, but above all with an inasmuch hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blonde boy, who faithfully stands next to the guard, preserves some innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
Most importantly, the burglar hero whose mobiles are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and allies temporarily transforming themselves into warriors, is perhaps sent by the devil himself.
It represents rotting, but perhaps also, nothing but for those who are, anyway, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that you can hate or admire, which has the purpose of harassment, enthusiasm and amazement.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious Terrace Works
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But the country refuses to take a position on this issue, even less so, to submit to the Agency's controls.
On the night of September 5-6, 2007, at midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates River; the largest city in the vicinity is 30 kilometres away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in IAEA documents, as it concerns the reactor that Syria built with the help of North Korea in a stone parallelpiped, hidden in a valley marked by a lack of electricity.
According to a U.S. intelligence briefing dated late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighboring town, el-Kibar, would be well-suited to produce plutonium, which would enable the manufacture of atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video featuring blurry satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the probable location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the power plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the nearby building, or even the interior of the building.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is hardly more information available than at the time, and even, over time, the mystery is getting thicker and thicker.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built an el-Kibar reactor, but had little evidence that the country was developing "an active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a “presumed reactor,” even if they consider the CIA’s presentation as “plausible”.
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked about how he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior UN diplomat gave only a laconic answer in the summer, claiming that the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians certainly quickly removed the debris from the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical landslide.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers directly following the attack from a member state, which appears to be more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
However, the IAEA rejected this argument after the particle analysis by calling it inadmissible.
Since then, damas has refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow inspectors to carry out a second inspection on the site of al-Kibar and denied access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps an obstinate silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in exercise at the time of the attack, recently said: “We will never make comments on this.”
This is how the investigation into this case has been going on since June 2008 without a result and that it is "increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem of the Agency", as acknowledged by a senior Western diplomat who is in service at the IAEA headquarters of the IAEA.
The IAEA believes that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the other three facilities that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated which facilities it is, nor what their function or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as well as the names of the neighboring cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspected objects.
It is possible that it is in a military base or directly next to it; that is exactly why Syria refuses access from the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is in fact spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is an intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone pipeline to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could “serve the production of fuel.”
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nonetheless, there are some plausible assumptions about the following fundamental issues: where uranium should have come from and where plutonium needed to manufacture the bomb would have been separated later.
It is unknown whether the engravings, which could hide high-value traces, were stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of land-loaded trucks have disappeared, no one will have information about the place of storage of the engravings.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria would have examined the al-Tibni salt mine, just a few kilometres from al-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, in 1998, to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
Recently analyzing satellite photos taken on behalf of the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Satellite photos, however, show that Syria undertook landing work in the three suspected sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it has not helped to dispel suspicions.
The IAEA has spent several months working on a plan for inspections to be carried out, which was intended to allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only time spent shows how much interest the inspectors have in this matter.
In the meantime, Damascus also put an end to this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not have been reported for this matter, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the U.S. ambassador who for a few months has been referring to what is known to be the subject of a more special inspection.
The director of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has certainly already talked about "an option that I am open to in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Governing Council and a good number of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to think: “If they finally find nothing, it would be useful for that.”
Love in Time of War
It’s been bad since Angelina Jolie made her debut in the summer as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don’t know anything more about this story, but it’s enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim woman, fell in love with her Serbian ruler during the Yugoslavia War.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested, and in response, some planned shooting sequences in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, the protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women Victims of War sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet the actress. Jolie is herself a good ambassador of the UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago she invited these women to meet with them in Hungary, but they declined the offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic said.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie’s script says long enough about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner to remove Angelina Jolie as a goodwill ambassador.
But, in fact, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted a shooting permit in Sarajevo after a few hesitations, but it is not known why it did not then come despite that permit.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political goals with her film, that it is by making a lot of effort that she has become aware of the Yugoslav conflict, and she argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and to give the opportunity to all parties who are involved in the conflict.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the war began. He meets again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim woman, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is still a big difference with the version “a rapist falls in love with his father-in-law.”
That Jolie’s film started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can provide him with peace: By illegally putting this script on the Net, like many others before.
Let's shoot!
Tonight, everything is going well with the Irish.
There is no trace of consternation.
This is why the local team overdoes visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy on the background of loud music, they clap their feet.
Baileyu-Pub from Cork in southern Ireland vibrates because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in the opponent's beer cups.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong" and the winner gets 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to go to Las Vegas to attend the World Beer-pong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don’t go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the terrifying question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will lead hiring interviews in New Zealand.
"However, I feel a strange feeling," he says.
"The country of birth is so far away and I have no jobs."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man smiling.
Due to the dark outlook in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, her brother Colin is now a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of the tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even expect a number of 200,000 migrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are realized, it will be a current of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish enjoyed great ease, sadness now takes its place.
The economic crisis, however, affects above all the well-trained young Irish, who have so far only experienced moments of happiness.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everybody had a job, there's excess money.
But in the meantime, three out of ten people under the age of thirty are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes in abundance the letters of readers written by young immigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes to the fore."
“There should be a uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the opportunity, will leave and our country for a whole generation.”
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, chairman of the Irish Students’ Union, sees a darker future because the government just throws powder in the eye and offers no future prospects for young people.
“They are reducing minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
She sees her comrades cramping from an unpaid practical internship to another.
She says her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this theme positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" fair, which offers full support on the theme "Working Abroad".
“But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new professionals to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy,” he said.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallery, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O’Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector e Germany.
A fashion house just leaves land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects in Hannover or Berlin.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional job, in order to be able to complete reimbursement of the credit contracted to build his home in his home country.
“The situation is already a bit crazy,” he says, crossing the threshold of his home for the first time in a long time.
“I’m making money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I’m practically no longer living.”
He bursts out of a embarrassed laughter as he crosses the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars from big brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by credit.
“There were moments of madness, no doubt, money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan reflects for a moment, resuscitates hot tea and declares: "I have no children to entertain and I'm young; even everything goes through, I can go back to zero."
The building engineer doesn't like the complaints he's often heard lately.
“No one should suffer from hunger, but our situation is not as dramatic as what we once lived here on the island,” he said.
"Working abroad for a while is not what can get worse, maybe it's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
“He was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life just continued.”
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leaving the future and discovering how life happens elsewhere.
In his palm tree, he already has a few years of work in London, which is why life should not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is one more thing that concerns her well in the last few days: the party to be organised on the occasion of her 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a good-bye night.
"Just not a lot of emotions," he says, drinking a long throat of beer.
"A farewell, it still seems disturbing."
"Let's call it a good-bye night, all relaxed, gathering a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as well as support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarómetro survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it monitors changes in attitude in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Democracy support has increased considerably in several countries around the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see table 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents in the region were satisfied with how their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase from 25% in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but a sharp increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America shocked support for democracy.
While this has remained good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have only experienced a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has contributed to the protection of the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and again declined this year, to 32%.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared feeling of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see table 5).
Approximately 31% say they or one of their relatives have been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
Stronger economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents in the region say private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their countries developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); although their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, is ex-owned by many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, cited by 19% of respondents (against 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A Slow Vote
No one expected a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the sinister and drowning country.
Election boxes and a new ballot were presented, ballot papers scattered in the cupboards, looted polling stations and bulletins of intimidation.
Voting offices opened late in the evening.
Many Hatians, including many who were displaced following the January earthquake, would wander around in the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them ended up giving up.
About a dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favors, denounced the fraud and demanded the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, exploded across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti at the United Nations, considers the event to be "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that they "do not believe that these irregularities, no matter how serious, have necessarily invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are due to René Préval, the outgoing unpopular president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr Célestin, who has little or no noticeable support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second tower reaching the second round.
With an angry cholera epidemic, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 ID cards, needed to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The challenge is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, of course, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
In the weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate by more than 20 points, to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on Ms. Fernández’s choice, apparently in mourning, whether or not she would abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the additional income at will.
Mrs Fernández’s government lost its majority in Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has deepened following Mr. Kirchner’s death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement rallyed with Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where one MP hit one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress doesn’t have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President an even greater margin of manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is largely overheating: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1% but many private estimates and union wage claims, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which proceeded to falsify official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy was stimulated by high global prices of Argentine agricultural exports.
But inflation has eroded the growth in the wake of a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps this is the reason why Ms. Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government concluded an agreement with bondmakers who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms. Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some <0x24>6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could only involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Minister of Economy Amado Boudou announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which looks like a prelude to INDEC sanitation.
It is unclear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer on her side.
If she does, she needs to gain the support of the middle class, among which kirchnerism is very popular.
When the Argentines returned from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have refluxed.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, without noise, many of her husband’s policies.
A half-hour for China
Taiwanese voters have been oriented towards a sort of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of her older brother on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters appeared on November 27, or 70% of eligible people, to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings towards the continent, having established innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just right.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayors, it failed to win the majority of the vote.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (DPP), which has focused on Taiwan’s full independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT of 45%.
If it were a presidential election, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of Taiwanese elections, including camper trucks and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal attire.
A compulsory mysterious assassination attempt has also been carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot at the young Mr. Lien, purely through his face, wounding and killing a passer-by.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder has had consequences on the election by leading the suspicion on the DPP and turning voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking to see how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid paralysing its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also abstained from attenuating anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Ma, for his part, claimed a confirmation as to whether his policy with regard to China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing Government will continue to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the fold.
China has not lost time sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let’s start with the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has been reinvented anyway.
Two years ago, he went wrong: his former boss, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocator in favour of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates was born under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is doing everything possible to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was welcomed as a DPP candidate for the presidency, as was Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the PPP and China, provided that their talks could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party had a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's premature approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a distinct country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to question the Presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen’s intervention, the DPP will have a hard time choosing from its potential candidates.
The KMT needs to make an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite the vertiginous economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT said its cabinet and local antennas would be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for the rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Award nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the "Best New Artist" category
Perform at the request of a president, and people are obliged to know about it.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer who was hand picked up by President Obama to perform at her 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises of this year's Grammy Awards with a major nomination in the category of "Best Artist Award".
Considering that Spalding has been a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist should not release more than three albums before the recording; which "identifies him as an artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one line pointed to Spalding in relation to the last of these years' success by fulvalating the 2003 production's success with the Norah Jonquies.
Electors of the Grammy Awards have rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a turn on a reviving thrill of a recording that was one of the top favorites last year.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, New Orleans' favorite rogue voice and frequent guest at HBO's "Treme", has been honored in the category of contemporary jazz; which is also strongly inclined towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John Lorff Je McLaugh.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with steampunk, has won some well-deserved recognitions in the big category together; in competition with the rich chamber jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" was an example of his live debut.
Grammy Award nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd annual Grammy Awards include a mix of landscapes by musicians and composers from all over the world.
At the top of the nominations, we quote "Deus Ex Machina" by Michael Daugherty, for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees associated with Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his No. 4 Symphony, "Los Angeles", a work commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles-based composer’s Madolin Concerto, Avner Dorman, is also in line for a prize.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year stars five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are the Chicago Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 by Bruckner of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey's artists; the Vercririum of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and the Voquiette.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" of Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loire" of Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchestra; "Marihér de'Orchester" of the Orchestra of Berlin; and "The Enchanted Wadrvan Bchander".
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionamentamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute work is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnet Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he soon wrote the 15-minute work specifically for the mandolinist Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"I wrote it using Middle Eastern sounds and a large number of North African ranges and rhythms," Dorman said in a phone interview.
Orchestra chief Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestra performance category for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received a nomination are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only nominees for vocalists-solists; these are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonova, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixes, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots: my life, my song"
The project of Temecula Mosque wins the approval of the planning commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public witnessing, often passionate.
Critics took the project by claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners said Wednesday evening that the new religious center was in compliance with local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahá'í, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, speaking on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it, as an American citizen."
“This shows that justice is taking over.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the center, at a roughly also distributed speech time, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no more America,” a spokesman wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centers also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of the order of 135 families co-existed in Riverside County without incident for years but she wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque of Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and would be 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas Road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
Arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why it's very special, even though it's far from being a really "foreign" form of life," said Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But the researchers found that the bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“We wonder what is still possible,” said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in researching life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could reveal the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we deem absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, open-planetist and professor at the University of Milestitche.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
“This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and the biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
It was not a casual discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it is equipped with high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances might be able to replace one another.
“Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus.”
"As a result, organizations find it difficult to distinguish these elements separately."
“But arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and somehow rubberizes the work of our biochemical machine,” Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of the Earth’s existence, she says; thus, researchers have hypothesized that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests there may be other ways of forming life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs were found in Compton
The other two exhibiting dogs on four robberies outside a Bellflower motel were found, Los Angeles County sheriffs announced Thursday.
The four exhibit dogs - two Akitas and two Gallic pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they had spent the night outside a Motel 6 in Bellflower, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were recovered late Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is that dogs are doing well,” Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They have been returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
“An investigation is underway.”
“We don’t want to say that,” Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were unable to join to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were healthy and safe, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were carried away missing until their discovery on Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the "AKC/Eukanuba" national championship in Long Beach, where they wanted to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other tests scheduled for the days before the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the couple's nearly a month-long dog show tour.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, just next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton Spaniard - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They have opened the windows a little bit, so that the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van's flight at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is unclear whether a prize was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to red again, the restructuring of MGM no longer waits for the final green fire of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start again at zero.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially rented Thursday's "pre-packed" plan by creditors that about <0x24>5 billion in debt would be erased; paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its production efforts and film distribution.
With Thursday's decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no legal obstacle is left before MGM to re-float under the supervision of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will be a direct studio of the gvid.
The staff will be brought back to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has completed a <0x24>500 million loan facility to finance MGM’s new operations and productions.
It is currently distributed under license by the investment bank, which hits itself at <0x24>75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances as it did not have the means to pay interest amounting to <0x24>300 million per year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert on recovery known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial difficulties and satisfy the more than 140 creditors in the studio took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the extra <0x24>2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be reworked as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of disagreements and internal debates, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially comes out of bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive several million dollars in rewards for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already earned <0x24>1.2 million, will receive a payment of <0x24>9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have raised <0x24>375,000 a month for their company’s management services, will receive a <0x24>4 million “success premium.”
Barber and Birnbaum are set to re-launch production of MGM, which released only one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films to be released from 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio is set to conclude a separate loan between <0x24>265 million and <0x24>275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM’s debt, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech Toys to Keep Your Budget Gifts Balanced
Although the main candidate for this year’s most wonderful toy is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft’s video game system, Kinect, both can make a big break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for <0x24>99 and a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jump strings, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your budget gifts balanced.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers – Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ Wholesale Club – to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than <0x24>80.
It is clear that Moore’s Law has evolved, this year’s tech toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are usually fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And button battery toys are increasing, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, <0x24>13 for 3 years and older) are pellets-sized toys from the size of an Indian pig that sing a note when you press them on your stomach.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start pushing, you can no longer stop.
To combine singing with dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, <0x24>60 for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel locks.
Kids who tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you’re a child of the 80’s, you’ll remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It’s back (Hasbro/Playskool, <0x24>40 for 3 years and more), with a backpack filled with questionnaire game cards designed to transform a car ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve sorter.
If you are suspicious when your child is holding your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The Mobigo from VTech (<0x24>60, for 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not educate as efficiently as the Explore Leapster (<0x24>70, for 3 to 12 years old), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with more luxurious, and more recran.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The Fisher-Price iXL (<0x24>90, for 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card input that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (<0x24>30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a lighter box, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to form words by placing blocks online before time runs out, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online Penguin Club pet, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, <0x24>5, for 6 to 12 years old) which includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items of choice.
It can be roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (<0x24>10, for 5 years and more) is the latest battery button micro-robots.
The fake animal moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It’s fun to do a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours has resisted a drop from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage into our dog’s mouth.
Bringing a softer side to order in China
Tang Shenbin roamed a town square like an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nerve loads, emitting low-level orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan—impressive officials of public order in China, fearful and despised for their arbitrary repression and leaning toward violence—to convey some impression to a set of spectators.
"You're right!"
"Be perceptive!"
Show them, he said, "What do cute girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely passed their teenage years in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-colored jackets and pants, were staring at you.
Four pairs of black heel shoes, aligned with the rule.
Four perfectly cared hats perforated at the top of hair attached by a knot rayed in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China’s urban inspectors.
A city has required all new recruits to have a graduate degree.
The province of Guangdong exchanged the grey-green uniforms for a more engaging so-called blue.
In 2009, a report reported that 50 officers surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the wrecker repackages and leaves his case.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in the city of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, their bile and their young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may have difficulty in attracting attention to China’s underground urban brigade
And because of that, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to comply with municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media portrays the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei province beat an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a waste disposal.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and posted online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a batsman was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game impregnated with violence, available online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained to assault street vendors.
"Chengguan has marked the government," China Daily said last year, a national publication, after a controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "true complete cleanup."
Skeptics say the approach is far away.
After the district passed an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real tasks or if they were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district announcement required female candidates, aged between 18 and 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "five face features in the right order."
They must have a size above average, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at 26 years is mandatory.
Officers said the work was physically too difficult for women over 25 years of age.
“It’s their image that’s important,” a district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; it is the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "internal qualities."
The Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement for the order of facial features.
That this means beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, people with disabilities or disabilities should not apply.
“We can’t let a boxer or a boss come to serve here,” says Mr. Zheng.
"It wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who is patrolling Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has pomegranates with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the emphasis on her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked from a debunked air.
Xu Yang, a 21-year-old co-founder, says: “Our job is to present the image of the city.”
They do not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they feed on greater career ambitions than simply chasing sellers in the streets where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team confronts a dozen street merchants who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as little bread or tofu bowls as possible before they run away.
"Master Wang, you have to leave."
"We've already told you several times!" said Mrs. Xu as a seller ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning her noodle bike.
Agents describe their functions as monotonous rather than arduous.
“It’s about the same thing every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the seller’s goods.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after the spread of false rumors that Chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen Chengguan police officers and officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were knocked down or set on fire.
Xindu has escaped such violence so far.
But calmness is barely guaranteed.
Just two blocks from Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as the regulations imposed on them.
The owner of the motorcycle shouted at the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the policemen, on their sinister face, broke a path with an elbow to their vehicle and left at all speeds with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, remained behind, his white badge turned back to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 or over - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li in a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience that starts.”
Prosecutors will not accuse Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Department of Justice raised criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, stemming from a case related to an assistant from a former campaign and his efforts to get a lobbying job for the woman's husband, Senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal surrounding his case made major national titles last year and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign’s office said he was “very happy” with the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he had no intention of keeping any charges against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice abstained from commenting on this.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, according to which there would be significant evidence that Mr. Ensign had conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails, and other documents, first reported in the New York Times in October 2009, indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife's proposal to Cy.
Ms. Hampton once served as a cashier during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for one year by law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to contradict the so-called lobbying door ban.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there seems to be prima facie evidence of a plot to violate and substantially violate the law of the turning door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the judge of the department refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed to be neglecting political prosecutions after a number of high-level indictments for making the final decision by Steve's section of the Tea Party.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take the weapons, said Melanie Sloan, the Citizens' Director General for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief attorney for Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and a follow-up the following day, telling him that the department was not seeking charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed on Wednesday in a statement, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecution.
"I'm not comfortable getting into the details of my discussions with the Justice Department, except to say that we think they've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that <0x24>96,000 payment by Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying jobs.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "marting" the interior ministry on a disputed issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the transport secretary to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after he engaged Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to hold a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Justice Department and put an end to its investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
About half a dozen of them were typing away in the rows of the audience room.
They sent out horrific testimonials every minute via Twitter.
At the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages on the rape case trial and children tied to their bed in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to result in an official ending where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court sketching appeals, which could occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial – as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists – created an “ambiance of circus,” a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury was badly influenced by the public’s passions.
The request could prompt appealing judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in the hearing rooms.
"I have experienced this in this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the auditoriums is violating the human rights of a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer at Mr. Hayes, chief attorney.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the State Supreme Court, laconicly rejected the claims in the judgment rendered last week, stating that the media were "strictly controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have annihilated it.
But that doesn’t seem to be the last word on the question.
Appeal courts have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 judgment dated, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have stated that the appellate courts seized to review a half-century later the sentence of Mr. Hayes may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the means of communication of the hearing rooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Shepp.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford School of Law who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that she was arbitrated.
Professor Donohue claims that some appellate judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from the hearing rooms could allow more fair trials.
The case of Twitter is just one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, likely to be discussed for years; which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered damage when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during jury selection.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and his daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of the prosecutors, and that he has abusively put pressure on a verdict by making an unusual weekly decision.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments on the effect of intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a contest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governorship and the U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media continued to entice the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily buzz of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "resembled nothing of what had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally."
Their emphasis on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the claim, that the news was more incendiary than the releases were slower, was a ludicrous view that would impoverish the Court's policy governing the media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said appeals courts were often attracted by arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their file, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that had reversed Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of media coverage of the trial and they specified that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civilization bring the clutches closer?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civilization broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a sign of genuine bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and Congress leaders did not produce any breakthroughs on the major issues that must be dealt with during the session of the “boxing duck”.
But obviously, there has been at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to score points.
The president's public meeting on Wednesday's deficit committee was equally civilized, despite the political divergences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect beyond the ideological gap; but which, however, still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two sides are now in a period of trial and mutual testing in order to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and electorate patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent comments of the participants revealed a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxation, expenses, health care or rights, both parties remain miles away.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed in the tone,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now next to the Center for Ethical and Public Policy.
“This is inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions and then they fade away.
That's good."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the session of the "cowardly duck", Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or the whole of it, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is envisaged on extending unemployment benefits, only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s meeting at the White House, more optimism is set for a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the “cowardly duck”, with the ratification of the “New START” pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the “lame duck” session will not necessarily merge with a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable.
"Once the things that have to be done will be done, psychology in the short term will come back to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civilization would lead to true cooperation.
"I consider most of what's happening between today and 2012 as a pre-show or a shadow-boxing compared to the main event in 2012," he said.
The reasons for this are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and to the voters present at the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to keep up with their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new Healthcare Act.
These supportive positions are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, delaying the retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their opinion, imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they needed 14 votes on the 18-member committee to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they had difficulty reaching that number.
The strongest resistance remains among the group's elected representatives, suggesting that there is at least today little reason or willingness to compromise on tax issues.
Galston envisages two phases in the battles between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care; followed by a period of greater bilateral cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
The public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the supportive spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans always want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then the two parties will closely observe the reaction of the public.
The one who is judged to lose will have to change his mind and find compromises.
But that would still be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congress Republicans than there was then between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more consecutive election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort from both sides to find a ground of agreement on the issues that still divide them.
Released U.S. documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and passes through to the Kremlin part of the pots of wine and the protection money it collects, the US embassy in Russia said in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the “vertical of power” – takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been purged.
It was written while Yuri Loujkov was still the mayor of Moscow; and he is largely responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but there have been few clearances since then.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied corruption allegations over the years; and he has won several trials in defamation on these allegations.
In September, he said the following to a Russian television channel, when he was questioned on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's throwing, it's anything."
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt, according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy report; and it is unthinkable that it would be for foreign diplomats to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it "dysfunctional" and claim that the government was functioning more like a kleptocracy than a government," according to the embassy's note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "krisha" (a term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means "roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire city of Mocrasco.
"The analysts identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level."
“Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a void in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services.”
The report indicates that the FSB raises the money of the largest companies and that the police target the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understood that it was better to get the protection of the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only, they have more weapons, more means and more power than the pro-criminal groups are.
“That’s why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high.”
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extensive, the protection itself can be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subjected to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has mentioned the fight against corruption several times, but he has admitted little progress.
The note from the embassy reports reports of men carrying suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev relies on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's Indem think tank.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
“It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the cost of corruption will rise, across Russia, to more than <0x24>300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are ranked at least as the least corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. Embassy note, which was only made yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly mourn the dissatisfaction within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, this could be the problem of my reluctance.
Interviewed by CNN’s Larry King, Putin hypothesized that WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted furiously to the statements U.S. diplomats had made by calling him Batman and approximating Medvedev to Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that this is our interaction, an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
“But to be honest with you, we don’t suspect that this would be done with such arrogance, such pressure, and, you know, contrary to ethics.”
Former Khmer Rouge fighters forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with decrepit concrete walls of poor quality, the director of Anlong Veng High School spoke about the man who built it, the last leader of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here likes Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader; and he cared about his people,” said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as the "cacher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Red Khmers, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Red Khmers in northwestern Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers are still organizing.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers turned to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally questioned by Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum enabled victims to face the people who had participated in the regime publicly.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led by the United Nations, delivered its first sentence against a former member of the Red Khmer, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of Tuol Sleng’s sadly famous torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as “The Red Khmer’s”
Faced with this development of the situation, anxiety has increased among the former fighters of the Anlong Veng Red Khmers; complicating their reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Red Khmers but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Khmers was glorious, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrown the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrilla from their base in the western mountains of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defy the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Samhiu in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had been in charge, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for his trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters have fallen into black misery, common to the rural areas of Cambodia; and many are those who remain nostalgic of the movement.
Although some Khmer Rouge elite officers have held their positions as local leaders in exchange for depositing the weapons, they are unskilled low-ranked farmers.
“These people have received very little follow-up after the capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are impoverished by the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
“They were raised in a context where doing business is a foreign concept.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before relocating in 1998 as a poor rice grower.
"Life under the Red Khmers was good," he said.
"My mom nourishes everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to provide for our own needs.”
The ongoing court of the Khmer Rouge has also raised concerns here.
The court is expected to begin trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer minister.
The court's mandate is to judge the top executives and the main perpetrators of the crimes, but it has not said whether it is prosecuting beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to Im Chaem, 64-year-old former district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the rule of the Red Khmers in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced workers had died.
Recently, on a turbulent evening, Im Chaem returned from work to the field near his wooden house on pilots, on a land road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Red Khmers.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go there.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable," she said.
“If there is more persecution, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defied the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also warned several times that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects; though experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, the documentation center.
“The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces,” he says.
“We need to put these pieces together so we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Red Khmers, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
As in most Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Red Khmers, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he came home with the book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he says.
"They're mistrustful because they don't know exactly how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
However, the Red Khmers retain a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a path, invaded by bad herbs and parched with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black sweat, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old mobile phone vendor on the road, said she didn’t know much about the man who was incinerated in this place.
"But he has a great spirit; and many of the people go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and, later that day, she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing her luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of military-grade uranium
The Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory in President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear materials in the whole world.
The deal was released in a joint statement published after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The U.S. government had for years tried to persuade Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and appeared to have unraveled the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations were carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to an official who mentioned the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the initiative of Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to provide an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
“I’m really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This proves to me that this process works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security promotion group.
Clinton called the deal a "very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the Obama Summit on Nuclear Security, Belarusian President Alexander Loukachenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept uranium highly enriched, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and poorly enriched uranium," said Mr. Loukachenko.
“It’s our product... We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
"We're going to use it for research, that's all."
Belarus drew closer to the United States a few months ago, however, expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the equipment had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and eliminated, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The U.S. government has spent <0x24>13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus's research facilities with poorly enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"A thorough coordination and organization has been implemented to strengthen confidence"; thus leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, head of the Energy Department specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to the Center for Non-Proliferation Studies James Martin, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to Loukachenko’s harsh repression of human rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential to improving bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its countries," he said.
The government has issued no objections to the CIA’s flights.
The government has issued no objections to the CIA’s flights with Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners heading for Guantanamo across Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered by Wikileaks in the daily El País, which adds that the first vice-president of the government at the time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to monitor them to “show that they were able to monitor them.”
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing complicity in human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between former U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the report of the Council "surprised the Government of Zapatero out-of-game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection with regard to intelligence flights over the Spanish territory."
“They just want to be informed” to avoid being “taken in the absence,” Aguirre reports in a cable.
Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, the head of the Foreign Ministry at the time, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive “would like to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had limited capacity of influence.”
In turn, in January 2007, Attorney Vicente González reported to the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the CIA's National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defense documents on flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy said after speaking to the prosecutor.
However, the United States has shown concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than for declassified information from the Department of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly among Governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, during a lunch between the U.S. Ambassador and the Interior Minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of their independence and will do what they think is appropriate for their collaborators," he had instructed them to do so.
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the action of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will certainly draw from any indication that Zapatero's government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations," Goethe said.
The parricide who went to confessions complained in the network of the "acquaintance" of being a mother
The young girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror of the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With the nickname she used when she was little, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two originating from Noia, the village of La Coruña from which she originated.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his romantic life, which ABC built with the help of the testimony of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician started a relationship in 1998 with industrialist Iván Tuñez.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they broke up, we found out she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
We found another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elector was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the young girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her a week in Palma.
But according to the contents of his communications, it is understood that their idyllic has fractured, they have separated.
In March 2008, she was in Minorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and vexed by the fact that I came to work there."
“When I told him, it seemed a good thing to him, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
And then, she’s talking about a mobile message she just received: “I want you to come home this month or give me an address to send you the child.”
Ella complains, "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the baby with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home."
In May, she talked about returning to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'll only stay there until 19, because on 20th I have to introduce myself to a job so I don't lose it."
She explained that if everything was going well, she would have taken her elder with her.
“He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person if that person is not my mother,” he said.
In July, there is another post.
When she tapes it, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and he was supposedly murdered on the 10th, was dead.
“Cesar is happy on one side, but he is not happy on the other.”
“On the one hand he’s with me and he likes this place a bit, but on the other he goes to school almost every day.”
She talks about a trip to Majorca.
"He'll be there a few hours in the summer and I'll save some money from the babysitter."
17, Greetings and Complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos in the email, you see, when he wants him, he finds me, shit."
The 30, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there is one: "I'm ahead of the money."
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of hers in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the Liberator of the Prison."
"Terror at the Galician (epigrapher)".
The last man who lived with her, vigilant, declares his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn’t want to think that everything was gone so she didn’t tell him that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered yesterday the provincial prison in Palma, from the centre of judicial detainees in Minorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the events happened, "and she also did not intend to harm the minor."
Before, she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and depositing her body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
People's Party members would win 4 seats in Congress and the CPS would lose 9 seats
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MEPs recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the outlook is more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation gets in these committees normally doubles that it gets in the cata.
As a result, the popular Catalans received 610,473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, they had received 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend now, which is desired by a deviation of votes from the CPS and the loyalty of the PP electorate, the analysts of this training have calculated that, if there were general elections, the CPS could have increased from 8 to 12 MEPs per year to less than 9 MEPs per year in the Congress.
These calculations would find that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one deputy - he has three now - while ICV would keep one deputy or win one.
But if the election agenda continues, the next meeting would be held in May 2011 for the municipal councils, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relegation to the head of the General Council of Barcelona - one of the 6 million administrations that handles the high budget61.
Both the nationalists and the popular agree that the PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority either the opportunity to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be a fantasy that this training loses its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to the PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy – during this last campaign, they met several times.
The popularity has also progressed in other major municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan Cell Facilitated Thousands of Passports in Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, Thailand, there have been three
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians detained by officers of the General Information Office of the Police of Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, headed from Thailand, provided passports to various Al Qaeda groups, among which "The Tigers killed" (the last of which were the "Tigers for the Liberation of the Earth" in 2008) and "The Tigers killed" (the last of the "Taimba" (Taimil).
The Interior Ministry has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" has "summerly weakened" Al Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus at the international level and " consequently, its operational capacity".
The investigators calculate that the cell, during the two years it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that included the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross total European borders and other countries with impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why other European police units participated in the investigations, apart from the Thai services, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be days after barely paid in the same way.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis were detained by Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another was carried out in Thailand, with the capture of the Pakistani Athamat and the Zelakans.
They were the ones who led from Bangkok the cell implanted in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "Islamic World Front".
That is, the documents should be on behalf of young men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found linking the detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even though the perpetrator of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that a few days before the attack was committed, a few thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency that was "invested" to buy mobile cards that were later used by the members of the "command" that killed 106 people.
The police have seized a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investment as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which summarize to give priority to the recovery of the economy complicity.
The president of the popular Catalan came to the meeting with Artur Mas with the certainty that he had gotten 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to make himself love, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the trainings that will be carried out by the opposition will be held in the vostition.
A possible deal with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general election, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are in Catalan key.
And as for the PP president, to support an investment "all sovereignist and independent discourse should be eliminated", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have a common bet to slim down the political apparatus of a very excessive autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to successions and donations.
Details of the Mas investment negotiation will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciudadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The managers of the geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage to the institution caused by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people of whom he was responsible in the interval he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself accompanied by the center's lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be to be able to carry out the charge against the responsible" for the dead but "legality and responsibility obliges us to take on the civil procedural situation of responsible".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not detecting the night nurse’s criminal activities in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the victims’ parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime was in August 2009 and that from that day on he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - which he suspected was that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures could not have been at any time the cause of what happened".
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in this case there is only an indication of imprudence on the part of anyone other than the accused".
The person already named "The Angel of Death" confessed before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused his death by injecting him an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of medical staff to the centre.
Injections of insulin and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to alleviate internal suffering, used to kill them.
But lab analyses will clarify whether Vila is not lying by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he already admitted that he did with the three women he killed between October 12-17.
The Charity does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders admitted, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number will be greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in her visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the case of the change.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet’s threat yesterday, which warned that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
The differentials of the devices have been tightened and the shares of European banks have fallen by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ECB’s ability to make mistakes and the euro has barely increased, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by short and very speculative position fences.
The institutional investor will be delayed to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the long term, leaving only unlimited access to the week.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and keep the quarterly auctions of unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond purchase programme will continue and that the signal will even be given to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blind to withdraw liquidity measures, God help us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they claimed they had not even considered buying bonds and they collapsed the markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year trafficking auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only <0x24>500 million at 5.28% compared to <0x24>750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, guys in Portugal have dropped 30 base points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole figures were published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million short-term and 15,000 potentials and they have a deadline until February to get private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even though Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release tension before the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest is Beethoven's hymn of joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains the fact that the Spanish stock exchange has undergone 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was quick and radical and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction for a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that it will resolve with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain asking for an Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in available liquidity, triple compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to the markets without die.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar’s wife, “aside from being, appearing.”
Courage, we can get out of it!
The president of Eulen will contest the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm continues in the open conflict within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the founder of the group, will contest, as he considers it "zero of law", the judicial council of El Enebro on the next 16th, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control by the group.
The founder of the larger business services holding company does not appear to be willing to surrender in its dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
He was excluded from his board of directors by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves as directors in the shareholders' assembly on 18 January this year, the contest is registered in the Register of Commerce and Companies.
The El Enebro Judicial Council for the next 16, convened by Madrid’s Commercial Magistrate No. 2, reopened the box of thunderstorms within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to determine the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The latest movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate appeal of the plaintiffs' five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly scamming the Act and abusing the law, validating and correcting the case.
This argument will be the basis for, once the assembly is held, to be contested by considering that it is "nothing of full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already unsuccessfully tried that the magistrate convenes an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a holding company owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez’s sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless requests the use of 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the appeal for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software creates real-time improvements on cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the Formula 1 world in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one considered the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final phase of the championship they all bet on Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari triumph.
Not to mention the skill as a champion, German Sebastian Vette, nor the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put into Red Bull's hands to transform it into a team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very far from high automotive competition objectives.
Named PLM, this powerful computing tool has been used to create assembly chains from manufacturers all over the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before constructing it in a real way, thereby avoiding flaws and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computing tool in its Formula 1 plant has enabled Red Bull to create and execute “in just a few hours, almost in real time” changes, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 squads had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 high-skilled young professionals who, equipped with powerful IT equipment, analyze and project all kinds of changes on the wagons.
The Siemens executive explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull’s bolts except the engine, which is Renault’s sole responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can go from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological development there is the amount of <0x24>40 million each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has deployed the high-tech plant to create and produce its boilers in a town 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered “top secret”.
The staff for this duty includes 580 people, including two pilots, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The Red Bull Formula 1 hero is probably the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the enormous technological resources that the energy beverage brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the notoriously null.
Steve Nevey, the factory’s chief technology officer, said five years ago that R&D progress in racing cars accounted for 50% of the wins and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of success, while drivers bring 15% of added value.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers, as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP Will Install 20 Clean Stores With Local Distributors In Two Years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain’s vice president, Helena Herrero, gave the example of the refurbished store on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to deploy 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openings were from Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM Personal Systems has ensured that the philosophy for the deployment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with industry experience and knowledge.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of stores claims to “improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, support, after-sales and even packaging.”
The Barcelona store includes a space with a global pioneering pilot program that solves potential problems of HP’s computer equipment as a guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'flying' a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liabilities war.
Despite this, it envisages a collapse of interest margins, which will be partially offset by increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years, its task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and can thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011, which will hold a three-year loan.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to resort to public grants from FROB, is to gain a market share by capturing a million new private customers - 700,000 if you deduct those who can get out of the bank - its big task to do, because so far this particular bank and the PME have spoiled them more.
This year it captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the wager on productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as the objective, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the financial year.
Few banks now dare set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize its executive plan Optima this year, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for an additional year.
Customers who avoid savings boxes will be their main goal.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a “difficult and transcendental” year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the outbreak of the crisis in Spain will be "slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is crucial for the survival of the banking case, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the liabilities war - which penalizes margins - is decreasing, the price of the risk premiums that banks and cashiers pay for its issues to get liquidity is already moving at the credit price to offset the drop in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a factor of pressure on credit."
"We haven't tightened the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials – see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of conducting corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "there will be a request for larger dimensions."
“Everything will move next year,” he said.
He claims that capital needs are "growing enormously" and any Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in fundraising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closing of markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the boxes
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of savings box mergers and reaffirmed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is underway.
When the process of concentration of Spanish savings boxes began, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
However, the Director General of the Confederación Española de Caisses de Epargnes (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been made, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, it is adjustments."
"Most has been fully realized; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the auspices of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well," he said.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process is carried out "as quickly as possible and we must be very satisfied" in the way it has been carried out now, not within the time limits set.
“The move from 45 boxes with an average of 28.500 million assets volume to 17 with 75.500 million is an unparalleled trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be compliant with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unhappy opinions on the slowness of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of serenity and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remind us that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain has the most stringent financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world and has attributed a "lack of knowledge" to those who question it.
The leader said that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings boxes, a system that started a "very important" and "goes to the fastest speed possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector was well aware of the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have caused a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, ranging from tax cuts for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or removal of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed without a professional contribution to the privatization of Prajas and the 49% of the Barajas and 30% of the AENA's El Port.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as to her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which is in conflict with maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even though now it seems to be science fiction, with a very favorable opinion stream, almost 50% of the population.
Thirdly, a new Euro concept, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines to the countries that violate them, possible suspensions of payments to one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defining itself, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating the deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a divergence between what Germany thought to be done (plans of fiscal rigor and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow to the Central European country was when Merkel had hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
Since then, it has been the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that political consensus in Germany and public and public opinion were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, by the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the EU treaties to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear a part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the months that follow, we should be assisting in the process of reform of the Union that makes these measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date onwards the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be obliged to declare discontinuation of payments, and in that case the private sector will also bear a part of the costs.
Germany signals us that we must follow a strict path of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be hard not to hear it.
It is not just about bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we are asked for is much harder.
And what he should absolutely not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater tranquility.
And let us know the opportunity we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard of this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, we have opened the way for the thesis to be put in place.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don’t seem to move it.
And among the possibilities envisaged, one cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a monetary zone too crowded by less serious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and Fraud of the Law
Russians like Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the willingness to escape a sanction.
The expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has spilled a lot of ink on the anti-sports character of such behavior and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the match ended (which their team was already clearly winning), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually become the leader of his group, the two players will comply with the regulatory sanction during the next game of the dam match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and several economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, unwritten, but followed rules, of this sport.
Part of the debate that emerged in the case is due to the fact that this was the protagonist of a team of the Real Madrid entity (who in his hymn displays the nobility and honor and who on past occasions condemned a fine to his players for analogue acts, a technician, a moorish, and an orchestra dramatization.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, if these actions are committed to a fraud of the law; for in fact, they are actions respectful of the sport regulation, but seem to elude its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that encompasses the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that with these actions has not been put in danger, i.e. there has been no violent play.
Another of these assets to which we are referring with the correct game is to avoid the team of offending players from taking unfair advantage of the opposite team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of Real Madrid players is that it does not conform to what is normally characterised as fraud or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been carried out in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but its action has been more precisely attempted to avoid the sanction.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is the type of advantage that offenders obtain from the intended faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a disadvantage to the rival and one does not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action assumes the fact of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it’s not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn’t count on these players.
Obviously the advantage lies in the fact that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with some degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action players complete a penalty match and move to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of the cards occurs with a first cycle of at least one.
So, climbing the stairs, it is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, which is nevertheless part of strategic decision-making that promotes the maximum profit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of fraud by law), otherwise they chose rather the time when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without leaving the penalty or escaping it.
Even though the border between genius and law fraud is widespread, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, appears because of two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way the director transmits them to provoke them.
The harm caused by the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offers Offensive to Capture Christmas Dinners for Groups in BCN
This year, the calendar’s dictatorship focuses an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th days.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and the lottery, when December arrives also come back the dinner of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen ball for the restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have started in an offensive you prices adjusted to be able to capture the majority of the customer, and almost all of them in 20 Euros.
To complete complicating the accounting, this year’s calendar (as the night of Saint Sylvester falls on Friday) concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 17th and 17th) and almost never had the year before.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budget reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying for their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all ask for battle prizes, confirms the president of the Restoration Board of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer, now, does not dare to predict what the holidays will be like this month.
“People think a lot before they book.”
“They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,” he said.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a ladder with the crisis, so the slope around 25 euros has become major in demand.
In a survey in various establishments of the centre, the collapse of requests for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic demand boom for Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the particularity of the calendar assumed more early bookings, even as early as November.
"We did our best to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remain optimistic after detecting an increase in billing since the second half and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of friends groups celebrating the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a tendency to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as the Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again inviting their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased slightly.
On behalf of the patronate of Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association), its vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts in the possibility to start seeing the end of the tunnel and argues that overall reservations are "animated", even if customers "negotiate to the maximum".
This is true, hope for the festivities has not fallen, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan’s nuclear program raises great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons “at a faster pace than any other country.”
Wikileaks’s leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy of Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that Washington’s nuclear program causes.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details offered on the contents of the talks and thoughts of the accredited North American diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, rather than increasing any "quicker" than "produced" other countries of the world and Asia.
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main concerns in Washington.
This is how the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser James Jones: “The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under attack of the Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials including short noise and the vulnerability of the atomic transport.”
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep the watch.
"Pakistan has to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear programs with re-revolutionaries, mini-revolutionaries, or missiles, during a U.S.-based U.S."
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of Pakistan's nuclear weapons production.
An Embassy briefing in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrant", supports the following: "Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, noted that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by Army chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it “very clear” to the person responsible that “the Pakistan Army must end with tacit support for terrorist groups.”
Hunting the head of Wikileaks
Obama will appoint a senior anti-terrorist fighter to avoid further infiltrations.
Interpol issued a red alert to track the movements and locate them in Assange.
All aspects related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be sure of the facts.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a “red alert” to “locate and track the movements” of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, this is not new, otherwise it is dated November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leakage of more than a quarter million U.S. diplomatic documents, but with the sexual abuse allegations the Australian faces in Sweden.
Wikileaks founder Mark Stephens said: “The police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
The 20 international police body based in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of the country.
Thus, Interpol’s 188 countries were instructed to identify or locate Assange “in order to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol is unable to give the arrest warrant to an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red notice call a free path for the arrest -- which the national police body must carry out --, especially if they have agreed to it, and if they have agreed to it.
The movement angered Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks was willing to answer questions by videoconferencing from the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
“It seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the Missive said.
As the world searches for him – and in Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he doesn’t shut up.
On Monday, he gave an indefinite interview with the director of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he demanded the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates that they spy on the UN by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign,” he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request " ridiculous and absurd".
“I’m not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has charged a senior anti-terrorist fighter, Rusell Travers, with preventing further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to reduce Assange’s importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who from January chaired the National Security Committee in the Lower House, asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations “to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides their grants or contributions.”
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to come back to his statements after saying Assange would be "assassinated".
“Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something like that.”
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, a former Arkansas governor, and a possible candidate for the presidency.
"He who is in the government that filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution would be a too kind punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with eyebrows to Carod fans
The Republican leader will allow the party to hold a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the fourth internal uprising within the ERC, without the north due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it can absolutely not give him headaches that he had with other courts.
That’s why Esquerra’s leader will try to win his new criticisms with eyewitnesses that allow him to blind up to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to speak on its continuity in secret.
By ballot papers, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to drive a certain penalty vote to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of retaliation.
In fact, the leader wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said he would not consider ratifying himself with half more of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "in Bulgaria" would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand that the president put his position at the disposal of the militia, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve a roadmap with the executive until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for Puigcercós' promise to schedule the 2011 autumn congress, which the leaders consider a certain fact.
The leader of ERC admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to make the organization able to wash its laundry room with family once and for all.
In this line, the article that current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the Puigcercós ideologist, the Innovació holder thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" was as if it had been done.
And he enumerated five of them, of which he highlighted two.
The first is to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militia, that is, to include new figures from Carod's adept sector.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all assembly as an operating mechanism.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of congresses through elected delegates by vote.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsive led the leadership to revise the assembly model in a specific congress of statute reform.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors in the rush, the time could be right to resume and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there have been a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the state of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to MILENIO of the state of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in the Valley of Mexico.
During the previous month of the year, there were 390 deaths in theory related to organized crime.

Very early on Thursday morning, the four owners of shared exploited land found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal shots in the thoracic, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Near the body was found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day later in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old man was killed with eight shots when he was leaving his house to initiate garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a gunshot wound to the head in the colony of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the grace shot on the front, the body of a man was found on a solitary road to Colonia El Naranjo and under the body was found a bullet struck with a 25-caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
Emergency bodies conducted a thorough search of the rest of the members of the body, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotlán warned of the discovery of a corpse in Peña Colorada, hands tied behind and eyes banded.
The man had an injury caused by a gunshot in his neck.
In the middle of the month, two men were reportedly executed who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán in Zaragoza.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony we found the rest of the body wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrect.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with a message with the name of Mario R.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, a woman's dead body was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin were detected Santa Muerte tattoos and necklaces with her image.
Around the end of the month, the body of a man in the municipality of Zinacantepec was found on the edge of a car with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of two men with a redhead and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, "That's what's going on with those who don't align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agustín Colony Justice Center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been decapitated in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next door; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the officers found a bristol with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The country’s representative at the COP16 said its country had made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and detailed that it would keep its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 percent until 2020.
China is continuing its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and reconversion its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested <0x24>245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work with the international community in this area.
He noted that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives raised with regard to the reduction of greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local authorities to achieve the energy savings, energy efficient use and emissions reduction targets.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-annual plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments from other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficient Use Program, which was implemented over the last five years and received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent lamps by economical lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s government’s scientific adviser on climate change, said China’s efforts have been greater than what is thought.
For example, he said, the per capita emission of greenhouse gas in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN detailed that the former panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo’s takeover as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right to address, where appropriate, a complaint to the Commission of Order of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been on the negotiating table an alliance for the presidential nomination.
Nava Vázquez has expressed confidence that Acción Nacional will be stronger after the internal elections of December 4 and 5, where a successor should be elected.
"This (a 2012 alliance) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, it has been an approach for local elections that has been successful and has reached its goal," he said.
The panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why “internal competition does not scare us; instead, “we taste it and make us stronger,” he said.
He said that the council would probably be able to appoint the best leader that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the referral "to the person determined by the council."
“I am completely calm and open, I would be proud to leave the office of president of the party to any of the five.”
He predicted that the party’s rebound in the July 4 election will reflect on the next dispute, even though “it’s not yet time to think about 2012.”
"For the moment, it's about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emitting alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that "many hopes have been made in regard to them, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the forefront of them".
When asked about PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked priests to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they start defending them; that they come out of the closet,” he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he did in his speech at the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no whistleblower, and even less censorship.
Obama on Twitter Promotes Law for Students Without Papers
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” the president tweeted.
President Barack Obama today met with the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize students without papers, with a message in his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message maintains a cybernetic link with a broader document asking the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we hope will soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding continued.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved, we will be able to set an agenda for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
“We all agree that this tax issue must be resolved by the end of the year...”
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in that direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic majority leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "closing vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize students without papers could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, even if more likely.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the last five years and have been accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the competition of a large number of Republicans, at times when the project’s supporting organizations are protruding into intense lobbying to ensure the Bill’s approval.
The majority of Democrats, who support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
This is why the Dream Act supporters require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed his term as Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but they said they were not going to support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature we put the finger on the wound
The second stage of the Language Pleasures was a walk in which the participants performed the narrative
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish.
The finger on the wound "...we are in embarrassment", gently launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and participated in it.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa in first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "plague" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: “Patience is not my strength, it is perhaps my wound.”
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but explains that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist whispered relieved and concluded: "On the wound I could only know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very intertwined.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a fascinating narrative that he titled Praise to the Invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but at a given time is discovered.
With the keys to magical realism, he talks about a famous ensorceler who touches the clouds, turns people who had gone far or repairs the virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that then turned to talk about the Americas, which was born with the big díors and the new díisses of the châta.
“Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a bitter way one would never have told the story of America with an imagination that lacked even the puddle.”
Nevertheless, he stressed, "the mad and the liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, it is no longer known which part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
This is actually called the ‘tradition of Cervantes’.
"It's because of his legacy that we're what we're told."
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the FIL’s invitation with its round table Le Deu sur la plaie.
The Cuban-Portuguese has put its hand on the great wound of social violence that its country is going through – and Latin America shares – producing disputes about trafficking and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers.
The evening ended with the intervention of Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also stressed "this must be on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at great speed also in terms of intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the benefit of dogmatisms, "behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes."
"To be the master of our own feelings and to be the master of reality, we must nudge: and nudge means many times to put the finger on the wound and disturb people who feel very comfortable thinking in cartoon, in black and white, thinking in established ideas and not writing in a nuanced world, and also rewriting it in a white and disturbing that powers.
Romano on the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had highs and lows in his career, but he managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the Santos Laguna and Monterrey duel in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast between them marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in the finals, he has had highs and lows in his career, but he has managed to reach the decisive series three times, even though so far he hasn’t put in the thousand and that’s why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine finally consoled himself with the under-championship medal, he remained one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played in consecutive finals.
The Santist strategist came to his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held Morelia's runs with which he lost with a total score of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closure, he also came to the newly relegated duel with the 3-decisive and the finals with the decisive 3-decisive.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a reversal again, as his team made an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two chances to get his 3rd and 11 finals.
Rubén has lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to detach himself from the evil so he can celebrate a title for the first time, even though he claims that the institution is more important for him.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I'm going to get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," he said when asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the finale, from which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can keep is that until the referee whispers the final, we can not celebrate, we are prepared in this line, the players are already prepared, because the last time we have to finish it, and with two penalties, we are not going to get it.
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not concern him, because he trusts his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes it is only for us to prepare this last time, we have been prepared in this previous tournament, we have been more or less prepared in the past, we have been the wrong one in the tournament.
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the glory offered by the titles for the first time.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
People must go to the Visa Applicants Service Centers before their interview in the Consular Section; the waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulate will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to submit to the Visa Applicants Service Centres (ASC) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take biometric information from the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will present some benefits for aspirants, including the following:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, no longer will it be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for the visa processing and another for the postal service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of <0x24>140 for a tourist visa, <0x24>150 for visa applications (including visas for temporary workers) and <0x24>390 for trader and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to submit to an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only appear at the nearest ASC where they will present the documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken in the CSA, applicants who wish to have a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants to the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra <0x24>26 service fee.

NASA to Announce Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency cited the press to present a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce on Thursday an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference Thursday, at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present who will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life,” which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming as intelligent beings as humans if their living conditions were improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from that we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the findings at tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest satellite), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Opposing 'block' Pattern
With the reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of ‘bipartisanism’ is made possible, it is reported.
The 60th had just settled when an opposing bloc appeared in Congress led by MPs of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared themselves independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanism' in the Houses.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'toned' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excludes them,
With this reform, they have reiterated, we initiate 'bipartisanism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four MEPs, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Directorate chaired by PANiste Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca as vice-presidents.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme on the basis of a political will and if they do not, they will be served again by both parties and in this way the opposing coalition will end.
“So far [the opposition coalition] has arrived, that’s what I look at, because we are excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, having been monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
“It is not in the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipartisanism in Congress.”
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that now Congress has turned into a ‘butin’ between the two, referring to PAN and PRI.
Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two.”
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the deputy's personality and to give him his seat at the negotiating tables.
"That they don't leave by cupular agreements out of 5 which will probably be 9 MEPs, now at the five we see, separated in different factions, we have decided to unite to find a place in the negotiating table, that's the problem, that in the reform they have not made, that we have not made, that they have reformed," he said.
<0x24>200 million extra for “the supplier”
The town hall of Mazatlán pays another check to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 miles pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount paid to the owner of the electrical equipment company in the second half amounts to 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, the last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, as a concept of "supplier account liquidation".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno said the municipality would pay additional amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just paid him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and 16 November.
Even if the provider has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after 25 July Noroeste had published a review of the checks that the City Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval of March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos, more than 10 million pesos
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing checks of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be taken care of
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Traders Association, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be taken care of and that new activities should replace those that tourists find bad.
He said the bad condition of the streets and alleyways affected because tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid nearby shops.
“Politicals know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t know the fortune they’re losing, otherwise they didn’t do the work for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist’s fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to take responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it, so it has to go through a preventive interview and not just do the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area we need to maintain it, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live there and the City Hall needs to change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends not only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
“They were given the attention they needed and this kind of facts emphasize something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is necessary.”
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said the recovery of the tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He talked about a number of places that need to get in line with the municipality and be a priority to keep the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Luckily Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that we should order first, clean and put us online to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP calls for results in Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges faced.
The Mazatlán business sector is calling for a Legislature of work that is decent and free of agreements between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is shocked and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Legislature formed by seven political forces was installed, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergencia and one of the PVEM, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges faced.
"We hope that MPs will actually exercise their right, free of agreements between parties because the custom is that they make pacts to safeguard their own interests and they turn into a carnival mascara of the governors and leaders of parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask them to certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
“We will make sure they do a decent and especially committed job with society and the sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to grow and add strength in the search for the state’s economic growth, as the economic situation is now very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they boost economic growth, that they generate stimulus for investment and infrastructure, and that will in a way stimulate the generation of jobs.”
With regard to tourism, he requested that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Governmental Tourism Secretariat.
“I understood that it is the second state secretariat with a lower budget and it’s incongruous as an important economic activity, generating currency and investment and competing directly with the agro-industry.”
Apart from the fact that resources need to be classified into detonating tourism projects that help give the state security and updating the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures could not solve.
We're looking for King Mage
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Mages Kings will be difficult to accomplish their illusions, as their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a cow.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear the toys and clothes they so much want.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live on a daily basis because their father doesn’t have a stable job.
“Sometimes it’s very difficult for us because my husband doesn’t have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes ... and in the afternoon I go out with the ‘pluebs’ for sale in the street,” says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bike, and her sister Isabel, 3, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo long aspires to have a ‘monster truck’ and for his 8-month-old little brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests sized clothes for a year.
“He told me [José Alfredo], ‘I’d like to have this monster,’ but I told him, ‘We’ll see, my son,’ because he was very dear.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, wears size 12; Isaiah, 10, wears size 10, while Miguel, 8, wears size 8.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream come true for the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the On Search for the King Mage campaign, by donating a toy or money to the reception of the Northwest.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estonia on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The investigations took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in locations that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of haschich, silver and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Sécurité du Québec.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees were expected to appear at the Sherbrooke Courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face allegations of cannabis production, possession with the aim of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches were carried out as a result of a long-haul survey, which lasted almost a year.
“It is information received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests,” Ruel said.
Approximately 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Module of the Estrie de la Sécurité du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Régie took part in this police operation.
Clandestine migration can continue without problems.
The Conservative bill, which the government says should solve the problem of ships loaded with illegal migrants, will obviously be beaten as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly support the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created the granite under your feet," Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said as he was surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow the detention of anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants for up to a year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill, because he took it to the wrong target.
“We’re against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we’ll see what the government will do,” Duceppe said.
NPD immigration critic Olivia Chow has rejected criticism from the back of the hand that her party is not firm enough about illegal immigrants.
"Neo-Democrats agree to take action against clandestine passers-by and that's what we're doing through another bill, the C-35," Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservative bill because it takes care of refugees and imprisons children for at least one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians are massively telling MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations targeting Canada and treating the country like a clown.”
“They expect Canada to take strong action,” Minister Kenney said.
The government has not announced a confidence vote on its bill, which could have led the country to elections ahead of its rejection.
However, a conservative told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that every MP who opposes would then explain to its voters.
The new unit does not make unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the creation of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea does not date from yesterday: Quebec reportedly consulted the Department of Investigation in New York as early as January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It should be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on the Police Services of Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for the Beijing public safety critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement "a rabbit out of a hat" and "a briquetted solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on possible future unity.
“You’re going to see the result when we’re going to announce it, just say it.”
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace the start of a public investigation.
“The more Mr. Charest insists on not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people like you and me think that he has something to hide,” he explains.
“The only way to have an investigation commission is to resign Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he therefore suggests that Quebec should give the Auditor General a special mandate to investigate collusion and corruption.
“We need to be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General,” he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squadron is not the only project in the Charest government boxes.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from Operation Marteau prosecutor, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently looking at some amendments related to the case.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit motorcycle groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several waterways remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has hit several areas of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another slip would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
There's a road that's broken.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rains have fallen on several regions, which is 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
Additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain were expected by Thursday night, according to the regions.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
As these precipitations must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some sectors, there is fear of the overflowing of several streams of water.
Flood warnings were issued Wednesday evening by the Quebec Civil Security for the Ouareau and the Achigan Rivers, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in St. Jerome, in the Laurentides, and of the Oak, in Lotbinière, were guarded against flooding and remained under surveillance.
In the region of Lanaudière, heavy rains resulted in the overflowing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken due to heavy rains.
Ten homes had to be evacuated as a precautionary measure.
In Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes resulted in the closure of several roads, including in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Crusaders Forecasting Centre issued warnings for several rivers on Wednesday, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and the Wolf.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has faced a partial reversal before the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial comments on social assistance and Haitians as well as on his rough wave language.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and gross language that is not suitable for broadcasts during the day".
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two people who had committed suicide, did not violate the codes on broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front of Social Assistants of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the program were inaccurate.
Animators should present solid information rather than misleading.
Regarding suicide, animator Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be a cowardly gesture.
The majority of members of the Committee concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont le midi" have addressed a delicate topic fairly and appropriately."
Therefore, no blame has been held in its place.
The latest dispute was about statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then given up on a face-to-face media that had sparked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI animator said that he had made no donations to help Haitians because we couldn’t be sure that the people in need would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension over there."
"My file has been in the wild for a year and a half," the animator said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of gross language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM broadcaster has collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station that will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during the hours of high listening within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealais of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special route.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008, explained.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights a little everywhere, because for those who don't like ground play in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the person who works as a security agent and as a commissioner for UPS has just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the Amateur World Championships of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October.
"I won the full contact kickboxing and thai boxing categories," he said.
"I am currently preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
"The fighters who finished in the top four during the last World Cup in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
“What’s interesting is that I’ve progressed in every competition.”
“At that pace, I’ll be first this time or next year!”
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punching and footing, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
The duels originally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous pugilist derived from this form of combat is the Vietnamese American Cung Le, well-recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to hold only one event in his career, he will surely respond to his presence at the King of Sanda Super Bowl, the Kung Fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the most popular and prestigious in China," said the sympathetic winner.
"It's a little the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro," he said.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals face each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
<0x24>450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has generously awarded <0x24>450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor that got the most important, the project management, for a sum of <0x24>295 million without a bid.
This consortium called Energy Management was established in 2004 at the same time as Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with the responsibility to manage this important <0x24>5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium was withdrawing the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Québec Party, the use of consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing price increases.
"It's the new way to make collusion and to knock down competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it in an open way," Pequist MP Sylvain Simard said in a press conference yesterday.
Earlier this morning, Mr Simard raised the question at the National Assembly because he said it was difficult to see how the public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded this afternoon, denying vigorously that there was a collusion for this contract.
“I’m starting to have my journey,” she weighed, claiming that the PQ had been “dishonest” and had “lack of rigor.”
She said that "it would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologizes.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scope of the work.
The construction is in progress and will continue until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the game of competition acting; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le devoir revealed last week, the consortium formula in the engineering-counselling sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overhaul of the Quebec business register allows more than 200 consortia to be counted, some of which seem permanent.
Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA<0x2B>, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, brings back to one and the same moral person, Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the Bay James Territory responds to particular labor dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding in a particular way since the 1970s".
The Eastmain project’s chief executive, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that highlighted the fact that the project management contract was granted from time to time.
"If you call for tenders and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say, we're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal and at a good price."
“But the idea is that it’s not the price that matters, it’s people’s competence,” Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than <0x24>50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering-counselling contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has 22 contracts, Genivar has 16, Texsult 14 and Dessau 10, excluding its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total <0x24>449,783,344, including the Energy Management Contract of <0x24>295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard made it clear that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau said the PQ was also linked to those firms that "financed" it, before clarifying that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The "green" label does not inspire trust
Greener, but sincerely skeptical.
The Québec consumer trusts very little to the actors of sustainable development, but also to fair brands and eco-friendly certifications to guide its choices.
Pis, although bathing in a media universe where messages in favor of more responsible consumption are pulsating, he regrets a lack of credible information, which he even calls a brake on his commitment, says the responsible consumption barometer, the first reading of which was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, according to the measurement tool developed by the Sherbrooke University’s Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications based on so-called equitable products, but also the credibility of products and brands as being eco-responsible, the Barometer says.
In the same vein, the speech of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
Responsible consumer information, however, appears to be crucial in stimulating this pan of consumption currently driven by nearly a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of the information would calm the burners of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one-third of Quebecers also say they are distrustful of the alleged performance of green products or services they are trying to put into their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habits and, above all, changed the brand of one or more products to meet their beliefs.
At 61%, they also promoted purchases from shoppers in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of foodstuffs grown in their region, the Barometer says.
More green and responsible – the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of 100 for this year – the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
But his social and ecological awareness seems to remain outside his car, the Barometer says: in 2010, just 28% of Quebecers said they had used public transport or advocated carriage to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which just took its first shot.
A State Loan for the Purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, who was asked to engage financially in the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris by the Angus and Parallel Society, agrees to cooperate, but only with a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, who hoped for a donation of <0x24>7 million from the Ministry of Culture to redeem Daniel Langlois the cinematic complex eXcentris on Boulevard Saint-Laurent by giving him his full cinematic vocation, did not get what they wanted.
The government agrees to get involved in the file, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution on favourable terms, at least in the opinion of sources from the state offices.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who pilots the eXcentris file.
He got him a final report about a decade ago.
But the cabinet’s counter-proposal reached the SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of state donation must really be discarded.
Recall that the Association des propriétaires de cinémas et de parcs de Québec opposed a direct state investment to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture did not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for others.
On the contrary, several stakeholders from the community demanded substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of ceans, spent ten years carrying out the author’s cinema in his premises after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to loyalize his clients.
The Angus Society and Parallel, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are conducting a private fundraising campaign, hoping to raise <0x24>700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, continues to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27 by projecting the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des dieux.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall The Duty and we do not know what he and his group think about the downward proposals that are made to them.
The veil raised on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks are waving the veil on what the U.S. considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians to Americans, but at the same time they betray their sense of superiority to Canada.
Thus, U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canadian-U.S. relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, held on the public square yesterday, offer more crunchy details than substantial content to put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, or in the middle of a federal election campaign, relates how far the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great surprise of the U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides some explanations for this situation.
“A near-inherent Canadian inferiority complex may require Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday domestic issues rather than to have this election be directed at the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign),” he writes.
The United States is therefore “the elephant proverb of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about it.”
The ambassador understands less and less this "stirring silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more than one party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote."
The other expression of this sense of importance is read in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival during the federal budget confidence vote in early February, by which Canada will show its first deficit in more than a decade due to a <0x24>30-40 billion relaunch plan," Breese wrote.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties were making its surviving conditional on the quality of the proposed relaunch plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that drama series broadcast on CBC send back from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O shows, in which little subtle references to Maher Arar, the “No-Fly-List” or the CIA’s kidnappings for musculoskeletal interrogations are observed.
Another cable reports that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he handed over a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent."
"The secretary agreed to revise the file."
Finally, let’s note that the mindsets are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC waves that the man responsible for this massive leak should be “killed.”
Mike Huckabee was born in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
The United Nations has proposed in Cancún a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas reduction (GHG) that corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to make in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding commitments to reduction by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs still monopolising 50-70% of the market were replaced by fluorescent bulbs or, better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (LEDs or "LEDs" in English), the majority of the 1.8 billion bulbs would be flattened by the GVs (G).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That’s equivalent to 70% of the global fleet’s emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitter countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase global GHG emissions from 53 GT to 49 GT.
But it will need to be withdrawn from this balance sheet another 5 GT to stabilize the climate rise to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, 5%, is produced by light.
With fluorescent bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by more than twice.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL bulbs, such as those launched by the Philips manufacturer this week - this company, by the way, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which would give an idea of a 100-year-old economy.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have made reservations about fluorescent bulbs as they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers implement the instructions.
But, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal thermal plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report outlines the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save <0x24>1 billion a year on electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire waits nervously for announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire "without delay" after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to demonstrate responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the Electoral Commission passed the deadline on Wednesday at midnight without publishing the results, three days after Sunday’s election.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the president of the IEC had told television that the commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
Calls were multiplied around the world on Wednesday for the ICE to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp counts on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former New Forces Rebellion (NF) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N’Guessan, the president’s campaign director, said the UN’s voter intimidation in the north of the country had discouraged the president’s outgoing supporters from voting.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's complaints are retained by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo’s opponents believe the country’s highest court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northman who denies any link with the former rebels, said the delay in the announcement of the results was "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until he claimed the victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that filing a complaint before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidency, on Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained divided into two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished the first round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% to Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment Rate Remains Stable in France in the Third Quarter
The unemployment rate in France under the International Labour Bureau (ILO) has remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (9.7% including overseas departments), according to the corrected data on seasonal variations (CVS) published by the Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in the metropolis.
The second quarter data was confirmed at 9.3% of the metropolitan working population and 9.7% with DOMs.
Over the course of a year, the unemployment rate is up 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wished to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has further deteriorated, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, up to 24.2% in metropolitan areas (<0x2B> 0.9 points over three months, <0x2B> 0.5 points over a year) and 25% including DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed under the BIT.
Seniors saw for their part a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolitan areas (<0x2B>0.2 points over three months and over a year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with DOMs.
Only the 25-49-year-olds benefited from unemployment stability in the third quarter, at 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 point over three months, <0x2B>0.1 point over a year) and 8.8% across France.
The Insee has not published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation methodology.
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical agency, continues to do so and announced a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini under trial and detention
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was examined and detained at the detention center in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in a pre-trial public procurement investigation.
Alexandre Guérini has been prosecuted for abuse of social property, theft of funds and public property, detention, active corruption, influence trafficking and ammunition detention, his lawyer says.
“Alexander Guerini is combative and wants to explain himself to all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, not ghosts.”
"It's easy to prosecute for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it's another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, held, through his lawyers, to pass a memo to the judge before his hearing to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined on Wednesday night and detained.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything other than running the waste he had to manage.
As to the allocation of the contracts or the destination of the funds related to their operation, he never had any knowledge of it, said Me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former general manager of the services of the Aubagne agglomeration, was put under trial on Wednesday for diverting public funds and complicity, and released under judicial control with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to provide explanations for the facts that are accused of him."
"The instructor magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his freedom," said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been examined and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them under judicial control, Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General of Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "influence and passive corruption trafficking".
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being examined for "subtraction and diverting of public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complexity of diverting public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was tried for "recourse to abuse of social property".
Among the people who faced Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently engaged in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies were used to launder the money of the great banditry.
The investigation is undertaken as part of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous mail for alleged fraud in public procurement, in particular in the waste sector.
As a close source to the investigation, the investigations focus on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a La Ciotat discharge, which collects the waste from Aubagne as well as from some cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Elysée exaggerated Syria’s mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", held a breathtaking opinion in France, alerted diplomacy, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the attention of U.S. diplomats.
U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some under this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to Americans, ranging from giving them advice on how to deal with their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not been countered by the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detainee in France and sought by U.S. justice for trafficking in materials to the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put in a crude light how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostage cases".
Elysée’s Strategic Affairs Advisor, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Orsay Quay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meets with U.S. diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own detained nationals to Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "martyrize constantly" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release".
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more as the Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because, after attempts to talk through discreet channels, “silence will not fix anything,” the Iranians are “masters in dilatory maneuvers.”
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge at the French embassy) "will require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>230,000 in bail).
And he tells us that the Elysée is anticipating other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will worsen".
“In the near future, Iranians could arrest another of the few 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains locked up in Iran.
An information is being released: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose U.S. demands extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on a decision of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is wondering about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks Iran’s clandestine networks of procurement of nuclear equipment, the enlargement of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a merchandise?
The liberation of the Iranian against the liberation of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, not only “was completely surprised by the judge’s decision,” but sought to oppose it.
"There have been vigorous exchanges between the French presidency and the guard of seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot come back on the decision" judicially, he noted.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser composes a phone number, hangs it, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian “is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy.”
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée did not undermine its efforts by means of mediated communications and “leaks” to make it believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an “important” and “influenced” role as a “mediator”.
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that manipulation bears its fruit as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes "the 'blitz' of the media of French officials".
On what is so much "gratitude" expressed to Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then examines the reasons that prompted the Elysée to verse in this fiction.
The intensive communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening up Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and unmerited".
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris seeks to “demonstrate to Syria what praise it can draw by playing a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “seed seeds of disagreement between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least sow confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our country".
No online games for young Koreans spent midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called “Cinderella” law that will ban teenagers from playing games online after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under 16 years of age, officials from the Ministry of Culture and Family said.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
“We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep,” Jo Rin, the ministerial official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
The online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, he said.
The government is also considering urging companies to limit daily access to these games for young people whose parents request it, the head added.
It will also make available to people who claim it free software that allows to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, compared to 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA designates host countries
Fifa’s executive committee on Thursday designates the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a prominent political choice where the struggles of influence and lobbying run the risk of taking a step on the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the FIFA Queen Competition will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of members of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emirates of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measurement of the economic and political issues of Modi.
The treatments in the backyard are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the FIFA Assessment Report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be very heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the source of the revelations that resulted in the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC handed over a layer of this on Monday, broadcasting a documentary that spans three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Why dissatisfaction with FIFA and embarrassing English officials, who have launched an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of government hopes to re-edit the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for London the organization of the 2012 Olympics.
Will this intense activity be enough to circumvent England's blason with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spain-Portugal duo is not lacking with their already-ready stadiums, their expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the two countries’ dark economic and financial outlook could weaken their ambitions.
Possible retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia’s share, which has become an outsider of weight despite the gaps in its file (states, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the move to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appears as the logical favorites.
The world’s first economic power, home to FIFA’s leading sponsors, the country seems to have a long way ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have built a beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat is the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, which is keenly desired by FIFA, which would in fact make the Asian odds expire for 2022.
With Qatar, which has come out of the game by proposing futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakening of the TV rights paid (due to the time difference) by European countries, the nerve of war for FIFA.
Second Mandate: Evidence
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac have not had the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
A mandate to the Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be nominated in 2012.
But the evidence does not do well with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
Then you have to act as if the doubt always existed.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac’s friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "something in the fall of 2011".
Speaking in front of UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday evening at the Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" has therefore seeded a bit of feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his nomination?
We were a long way off.
The President only recalled that the 2008 constitutional review limited the number of five-years to two.
He was making a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has spoken of the presidential election, on the tone of humor, during such meetings.
"At the worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he told them in July 2009.
Rebelate in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His speeches before yesterday do not make him more candidate than yesterday; they do not make him less.
If they make comments, it is for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for the PS candidate, on the one hand.
But that’s not the entry in front of Ségolène Royal that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS are demanding an earlier battle order than expected.
The wrong polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon’s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy’s (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L’Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP above," the Prime Minister's surroundings responded immediately and cautiously.
“If he thinks the defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate,” Raffarin said.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, who is resigned to the obvious.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain its purchases of state securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to provide an opportunity to clarify the way out of the crisis or, at least, to announce the end of a number of unconventional monetary policy operations to be completed by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis requires that the Frankfurt issuer will no doubt be able to afford to be as peremptory as it is to aggravate a situation more than it is today on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB’s active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my consideration to my European partners (...)."
Yesterday, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show himself more discreet about his intentions, merely stating that the programme for the purchase of state securities was "reviewing" us on the secondary market and that we will see "that" in the secondary market.
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its main executive rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB’s purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that the prospects of a continuation of purchases are expected (see page 29).
Economists also do not expect a significant change of direction.
While lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still proceeds to unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine that she's changing her schedule significantly."
“Otherwise, it would take the risk of causing new tensions in the short term,” says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
“A progressive release announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” said Norbert Bräms, Sal’s economist.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these bonds to drive a thin market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuer has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
“It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a packing of the returns paid by the most vulnerable states,” said a major bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates fly, States will be even more bothered to reduce their debt, otherwise stabilize it.
The saving of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi turns the back
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation was somewhat relaxed yesterday, with a 10-year bond rate reflux.
A return to precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "unencrypted" and expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the interested party later denied.
On Tuesday, however, the gap with German long rates had reached the record of 210 base points and the price of bankruptcy insurance contracts (CDS) had flew to 263 points, resulting in a certain downturn in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "strongly concerned" by "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland.
“The bad news is that it is like Portugal,” said Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atonement of tax revenues that goes with it, causing the state to run the risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the current budget in the Senate tabled at 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates, the public deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (against 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7 billion.
“If necessary, new austerity measures will need to be taken,” said Olli Rehn, Economic Affairs Commissioner.
For the time being, Italy has received support from international institutions.
“The fundamentals of his economy are in order and his accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, Italy’s IMF International Monetary Fund’s managing director.
“There is no problem immediately, either in the short term or in the long term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts demanded from Italy are less than those demanded from other countries,” observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of OECD.
The issue of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion for censorship in the House of Representatives, after which early elections could be held by the end of March.
There would then be an unfavorable period for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans Reflect on Strengthening Anti-Crisis Devices
Christine Lagarde again hammered him yesterday as part of a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that they have demonstrated it again on Sunday in the day and at night, are obviously solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on European bond rates has brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet talk about the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt rating, the target most targeted by speculation today.
“As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which is particularly affecting banking systems,” said Exane BNP Paribas economists.
Especially since "political time is much slower than market time".
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it presents, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis arrangements.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
This is also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
In the menu, the outcome of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSI), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began on Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform far-eastern investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the field.
The first issue of ESF securities is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the U.S. would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional IMF direct commitment.
The countries that are at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, in turn, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in terms of the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are in addition to closer austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path than those of Greece and Ireland.
At all costs, one and the other should avoid asking for international assistance before putting in place their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the necessary structural reforms to restore sustainable trust.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of sovereign bond markets.
On November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea that if the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to hand over its portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would suffice, "preferably" in the form of direct injections of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion to date.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions are worse.
Snow and glaze: 24 departments in orange vigilance
Snowfall still creates traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Britain, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance due to the risk of snow and glare.
Eure, Eure-et-Loire, Les Deux-Sèvres and Vienna joined the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later at night.
According to Meteo France, sustained snowstorms affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, punctually from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snow episodes are notable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Meteo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were banned with a weight of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking their vehicle only in case of need and the traffic of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the circulation of heavy weights.
The prefecture "invites all drivers to be cautious on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights to Roissy airport in Paris on Thursday and 10% to Orly due to the coming snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France has been full, billions have been raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion are mentioned for the Grand Paris metro that the Société du Grand Paris is to be built.
To start this SGP, the state has announced a capital allocation of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this amount will then allow the SGP to borrow a share of the financing of its double loop on the markets.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The Amending Finance Act 2010, which was reviewed by the National Assembly’s Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the office tax in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
It is numbered: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year."
The second is a restructuring of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, to increase its product and to affect this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that report?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We're far from the <0x24>4 billion.
“It is clarified that these tax resources add to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of capital provision that will be mobilized by the state and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses,” the statement reads.
In the SGP, this system is not found shocking.
“From the moment you create revenues (both taxes, ndlr), you can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the <0x24>4 billion afterwards,” it explains.
"This will be inscribed in the budget and drawn as you measure it."
The SGP estimates that the <0x24>4 billion will begin to be enrolled in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised <0x24>4 billion is still for absentee subscribers, is likely to provoke a somewhat agitated parliamentary debate.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Avenger Hackers and Spy in Diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it turns out to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears only as a scandal in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and predicts a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file constituted by a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press releases.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those of which Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi’s sinisterly caricature profile has long been for cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files must be composed of only new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And this not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (we do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who engage in occultism only believe what they already know, and who reaffirm what they have already learned.
This is Dan Brown’s success mechanism.
It's for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of a limited mind) the head of the secret services (otherwise he could be, as I know, editor at Liberation), who only holds as true what he acknowledges.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as the one Newsweek published last week.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any cultured person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of state can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises, they have been transformed into the center of a few exercises.
Any investigative film spectator knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one seems to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put U.S. diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the world’s most powerful country brings a non-negotiable blow to the prestige of the State Department.
So the scandal does not put victims in crisis as well as the "burrests".
But let’s get to the deep nature of what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell’s time, every power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of its subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been fully proven since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the motorway borrowed, and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – elected as the citizen’s avenger – can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be disclosed); it is also true, that knowing everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but to reveal, as did all secretie, was an empty secret.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it has done too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to put any reserved information online - it would be published on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is useless to hope to be able to maintain confidential relationships over the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relationships be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore Romanesque, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who are discreetly moving in diligence to uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned from the heart or, more often, in writing to the heart.
The information will be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: at the bottom, Watergate’s espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing in crab, i.e. backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wired telegraph (telephones).
The video cassettes (analogs) had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and back and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (digitals) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the travels it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is not extraordinary that the policy and communication techniques go back to horse-drawn cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secret of the embassies.
Now, it is the embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France bids its promises of funding
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to review the compliance with the pledges of fast-start or early-start financing made by developed countries.
And the big french whistleblowers are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries have pledged to provide <0x24>30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU came out the big game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: report detailing the actions of its Member States, press conference, major side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciated and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU has announced <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on the right track for its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must, according to the Copenhagen Agreement, be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States of which France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years under fast-start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of level of public development aid.
On the contrary, France considers that funding for "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or the overall level of public development aid.
Concretely, France’s total amount of support for developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment in terms of “new and additional” funding...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their own mode of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 loan equals <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 given.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
While the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to emission mitigation that rely on more efficient technologies), it is necessary to present a euro that will be recovered as a loan equivalent to a euro that will be borrowed (the cost of the loan should not be more than the cost of the country).
But France has only to make such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to verify by yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other cases) comply with their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the very large majority of the European Union spends <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to meet its commitment, France only puts 10 cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
Nice pass tour!
In short, in its fast-start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, it is believed to be spending 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems well that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not...
The early funding chapter is just a small, relatively short-term issue compared to the entire climate debate.
But it could be a grain of sand more in the huge machine that is UNFCCC.
Hopefully this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to draw lessons from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other EU countries.
But most importantly, France could advance discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the way in which loans are accounted for.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast start and its vision of “additionality” and the use of loans would be of a nature to increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child consumes 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (ex Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought between July and September the foods generally consumed in four meals and a snack in one day in the supermartine of a Parisian children's day.
These types of meals, including official recommendations – five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day – as well as candy, were examined by laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or likely carcinogens and five classified as carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
“Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individually taken chemical are not exceeded, our investigation shows well that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrying,” the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogen residues and three proven as certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as encase by the study, has traces of six chemicals, but a fungicide is prohibited in France.
The same goes for Kenyan green beans, included in lunch, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, sliced steak, tuna in the box, and even bread baguette and chewing gum were stuffed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to warm the meal to the microwave was not exempt from it.
The final risk to the consumer of this "contamination cocktail" is "probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "facing the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase of civilizational diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
