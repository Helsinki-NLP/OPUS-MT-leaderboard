Wales MPs are concerned about ‘looking like troublemakers’
There are certain concerns of some MPs regarding the change of their names to the MWP (Congressman of the Welsh Parliament).
The problem was raised by plans to change the name of Congress to the Wales Parliament.
Members of Congress on this concerned agenda may be a matter of raising left-handed debates.
A Labour Party spokesman said his party was concerned that "the phrase will be with Twp and Pwp."
For non-Wales native readers: In Wales, twp means temporary and pwp means partition.
A stripe party spokesman stated that the whole party was "not proud" and suggested other names.
A Conservative Party spokesman shared that his party had "no idea" of changing the name, but did not forget to mention how the abbreviation of MWP could easily turn into Muppet.
The Welsh w letter is pronounced similar to the English Yorkshire letter.
The Congressional Committee is currently drafting a bill relating to the name change, stating: "The final decision on any identification of MPs will, of course, be of concern to the MPs themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh parliament the right to rename itself.
In June, the committee announced the results of a referendum on proposals to seek a consensus basis for the nomination of Parliament as the Wales Parliament.
Considering the nominee story of Congressional Deputies, the Senate Committee on the Welsh Parliamentary Proposal, or WMP, but the results of the rally show the secular tendency of the Wales Senate.
Congressional delegates are publicly making other choices, but efforts to reach consensus may be a concern for Election Commissioner Elin Jones, who is tasked with drafting amendments over the coming weeks.
The draft amendment will include other changes in the way Congress operates, including rules on how Congressional Deputies function and the design of the governance machine.
Members of Congress will cast a final vote on the question of what should they be renamed when they contribute to the amendment bill.
Macedonians voted in referendum to change the country’s name
Voters went to vote on Sunday about whether they would change the country's name to the "North Republic of Macedonia."
The comprehensive vote was set up in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, where there is also a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long asserted that the name of its northern neighbor corresponds to its own territory and has repeatedly opposed becoming a member of the EU and NATO of your country.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a member of the opposition party about changing the country's name, has announced that he will cancel the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that changing the country’s name is the price to join the EU and NATO.
The bell of St. Martin's church fell in silence when the crisis took place in Harlem
“Historically, the seniors to whom I was exposed share that every corner of the street has a bar and a church,” Adams said.
“Until today, there is no church or bar.”
He found that the disappearance of the bars was acceptable.
Today, he says, “There are many ways to promote people.”
“Bars are no longer public lounges where people come to visit regularly.”
As for the churches, he was concerned that money from the sale of the property would not be as sustainable as the leaders expected "and not sooner or later, everything will return to the starting line."
He added that these churches could be replaced by common courts with many apartments of decimals, which would be of no use in preserving the seriousness of local worship.
He added, “A very small part of those who buy apartments in those common courts will be white people, and then the view of the closed churches will come faster than ever, because there is no reason for the inhabitants of those apartments to become monks.”
Both churches were built by white parishes before Harlem became a town for the colored people - the Metropolitan Community in the 1870s, becoming St. Martin's a decade later.
The first Diocese of White Diocese moved into the 1930s.
A nearby religious body of colors has taken over the site.
St. Martin's was managed by a colored leather parish under the leadership of priest John Howard Johnson, who led a vegetation dealership on 125th Street, a shopping mall in Harlem, which opposed hiring or inciting colored people.
A fire in 1939 caused the building to be severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's clergymen planned to rebuild, they set up a bell tower.
Professor David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and the successor of St. Martin's, proudly called the bell "the bell of the poor".
The July bell-control expert preferred a different name: "A cultural treasure" and "an immutable treasure of history."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell to be played by a colored skin musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who pursued a larger bell tower at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some of which are brought up by church-in-chief leaders, others by the Catholic diocese.
The diocesan administration - the administration of the diocese, including the ecclesiastical leaders - referred to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "will seek to transfer costs" to the diocesan administration, although they are not involved in hiring ecclesiastical and archaeological institutions.
Some clergymen are dissatisfied with the lack of transparency in the diocese.
13-Year-Old Shark Attack Catches Sea Shrimp in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while scuba diving in California on Saturday, the first day of the shark season, officials said.
The incident happened before 7:00 a.m., just off the coast of Beacon's at Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego’s KSWB-TV that he was driving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming and then all swimming together pulling him out of the water.
Hammel shared that at first he thought it was just an interesting scream when he caught the shrimp, but then he "recorded that the boy was screaming: 'You were bitten!
You've been bitten!"
The entire bone of the boy was revealed," Hammel noticed as soon as he arrived at the boy's place.
"I call on everyone to get out of the water right away: 'There's a shark there!'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by plane to the Rady Hospital in San Diego, where the boy is in the insurance company, in a state of tragedy.
The name of the shark is the perpetrator of the unidentified attack.
Rescue officer Larry Giles shared in a news conference that they had discovered a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but they identified it as not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered a severe injury to the upper part of his body.
Officials have closed the entrances to the beach from Ponto in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas within 48 hours of the day for investigative and safe purposes.
Giles revealed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Strategic Attack to Sainsbury's UK Beauty Market
Sainsbury’s is pushing hard for Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beauty shops in the traditional way, where there are always helpers.
As part of the huge push to the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion British beauty market, where sales in the fashion and household industries continue to grow as sales declined, the larger beauty shops would be tested in five stores across the globe.
Investing in the beauty industry emerges when supermarkets are looking for alternative ways to take advantage of the supermarket for TV, microwave ovens and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said for the first time they doubled their beauty product size to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Available brand chains such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have additional space and sales areas similar to the display in the store as styled at Boots.
The supermarket is also reinforcing its Boutique makeup product line so that most of the products are pure vegetables – which is increasingly being hunted by young customers.
In addition, fragrance retailers will test the discount at two Sainsbury's stores, the first store opened in Croydon, south of London, last week and the second store opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Purchasing online and redirecting to buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to put more emphasis on attracting customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the stores will be increasingly similar to the grocery stores as the supermarket chain tries to cope with offers from Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's, which has brought Argos' stores to hundreds of stores and has also introduced some of Habitat's stores since they bought both brand chains two years ago, which has boosted grocery sales and helped more profitable acquisitions.
Supermarkets have previously tried to improve their beauty and pharmaceuticals but failed.
Sainsbury's had experimented with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after there was a problem of dividing revenue from commodity markets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was launched after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceuticals to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million in the past three years.
It is known that Lloyds will contribute part of the plan, by enhancing a range of skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commerce Officer at Sainsbury’s said: “We have transformed the look and feel of the beauty series to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialized training for employees, who will give direct advice to them.
Our range of brands are designed to suit every demand and enchanting environment as well as convenient locations that are synonymous with the fact that we are now an attractive, traditional shopping stopover.”
Peter Jones 'enraged' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract
Dragons Den's star Peter Jones was "enraged" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract in her stylish brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn’t have time for their Truly furniture and accessories brand.
The couple’s business is like the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning’s 37-year-old program went to Instagram to announce that she would leave.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den, angering star Peter Jones as she withdraws from their super-profit brand business at the last minute – to focus on her own new fatty contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
At a tense Tuesday meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, sources said Jones was "enraged" when the program's golden girl admitted that her new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant that she was not enough.
The business is the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby’s estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When the 37-year-old star Willoughby posted on Instagram to announce that she would leave Truly, Jones quickly left the UK to go to one of her apartments.
A source said: “To date, Truly was Holly’s top priority.
It should have been her long-term future, which will probably accompany her over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave made the people involved so astounding.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, the time is very close to the launch.
There’s a warehouse full of goods at Marlow’s headquarters that’s ready to launch.”
Experts believe that the departure of the show’s host This Morning, one of the UK’s most famous stars, could make the company pay millions of dollars for strong hand-in-hand investments in products from cushions and candles to clothing and furniture, and the ability to get back on track.
And that could be the end of a long-lasting friendship.
Willoughby's parents and husband Dan Baldwin became close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded True with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together and Jones had a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin to become the host of ITV's show I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We will not comment on anything about his business issue.”
They love each other so much that they love each other deeply.
He was joking about the criticisms he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider “not to be influential” because he saw the North’s leadership potential.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a loud voice that he was “the show’s leader.”
"I'm not giving up anything."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June when Trump dispersed it as a major step towards denuclearization in North Korea.
But denuclearization negotiations have been suspended.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the head of North Korea’s foreign ministry, Ri Yong Ho, spoke to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not notice the “return” of the U.S. counter-attacks.
Instead, he said the U.S. is continuing sanctions to increase pressure on the country.
Trump had a much more optimistic outlook in his speech in his campaign.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
“We’re going to make war with North Korea.
Millions of people are likely to be killed.
We’re in a good relationship now.”
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim had positively resulted in an end to the missile tests, helping to free the detainees and bringing the U.S. military back home.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to become president, but instead of 10,000 outsiders trying to get their feet into this tough area, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Earthquakes and Waves in Indonesia Destroyed the Island and Killed Thousands of People
For example, after the disaster from the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has disappeared, no declaration of national disaster has been made, a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very determined not to ask for international assistance, so that's very challenging," Subung said.
While Save the Children is gathering a group to move to Palu, they are still not sure whether foreign workers can work in the area.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to consider whether international agencies were allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Despite the constant earthquake that Indonesia has to endure, the country has not yet been prepared as closely as possible for the anger of nature.
While divinity-wave dwellings were built in Aceh, such places were not common elsewhere.
Although warnings are effective, the lack of sounds of divine warnings in Palu could lead to human harm.
At peak times, moving between many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Accidents make logistics work even more complicated.
An ambulance train left in Lombok to cure earthquake victims looking for a way to Palu, but it would take at least three days to get to where the disaster occurred.
President Joko Widodo has turned Indonesia’s old infrastructure improvement into a center of his election campaign and he has wasted money on road and rail construction.
But the financial shortage has made it difficult for Joko’s administration to face re-election next year.
Joko is also faced with pressure from the tensions between religions that have not ended in Indonesia, as members of the majority of Muslims pursue a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were thrown out of their homes when gangs of Christians and Muslims ravaged the streets, using rifles, bows, and other raw weapons.
Follow-up: Daniel Sturridge brings Liverpool a match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the UK’s Outstanding on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London, by a 89-minute win.
Sturridge received the line-up from Xherdan Shaqiri in the position of framed to Chelsea 30m as his team was ahead 1-0.
He handled the ball with his left leg before throwing a shot into the long vertical column.
Pull the bounty and head to the upper right corner of the frame.
The ball crossed the range with Kepa Arrizabalaga and flew straight into the net.
"It's just that I'm in the right position, getting the ball and the players in which Shaq is always trying to climb up, so I just try to climb up," Sturridge said on LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming so he handled a touch and shot right away without much hesitation."
Chelsea led ahead of nearly half of the game after Belgian star Eden Hazard opened in the 25th minute.
In this phase of the ball, the Royals handed the ball to Mateo Kovacic before moving around the area between the yard and climbing up to the Liverpool yard.
Kovacic had a wall switch from the middle of the yard.
He had a beautiful slot stack, heading to Hazard on his way to the forbidden area.
Hazard removed the defensive and finished with his left foot in the corner of the bridge, overtaking Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
The match between Liverpool and Naples in the Champions League round will take place at 3 p.m. Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at UEFA Europa League at 3:00 p.m. in London.
Damage caused by Indonesian waves reached number 832.
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquakes and waves has risen to 832, the National Disaster Center said earlier Sunday.
Many are said to have been trapped in the demolition of buildings caused by a 7.5-degree quake on Friday, which followed up to 20-foot-high quakes, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the center's news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, is drowning in the ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for allegedly hitting a woman.
After discovering the body of a woman discovered this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation has been started.
The 44-year-old victim was found at 7.55 a.m. at Grayson Mews, John Street, with injuries, after which a 32-year-old suspect was arrested.
Police are calling on locals if they see or hear anything, come to the emergency room.
Police investigator Brian O’Hagan said: “The new investigation goes into the first phase, but I call on anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead, if you have seen or heard anything suspicious, please let us know.
I also call on anyone, especially the drivers, if accidentally retrieved anything from the corners of the journey will contact us because they can get important information for our investigation.
A police spokesman identified the woman as a local resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the house.
This afternoon, some people reportedly had a relationship with the woman who had come to the scene to report where the victim had been in the morning.
The investigation is underway while police said they were in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return home but police said no one was allowed to enter the building.
He didn’t say a word when he found out.
Residents are told that it will take a few hours until they are allowed to return.
It is known that a policeman told a man that the entire area was considered the scene of the incident.
A touching woman came to the scene.
She always said it was “true.”
At two o’clock outside the police cars in the blockade area, there was another car outside.
A lot of police are present inside the area that is blocked tracking the apartment.

The Cromwell statue of Congress becomes the latest memorial to inspire the story 'rewrite history'
The exclusion would be like a totality of justice for the Taliban’s destruction of many Thanh doctors, as they have destroyed countless architectural and religious works in Britain.
But the Cromwell Society describes Crick's words as "evil" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It is inevitable that discussions about leaving Oliver Cromwell's statues outside the Westminster Palace will become the focus of the present.
The symbols of the civil wars in England were not issued or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's wrong will be replaced by Thomas's actions in the last century.
Representative Cromwell, William Hamo Thassycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and is part of the history of a character that many believe is still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Maybe at the end of the 19th century there will be more than now, Cromwell is seen by many as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his opinion as a dictator.
Whether it is a perfectly accurate specimen for the subject in the ongoing historical debate.
It is certain that the conflict between the 17th century shaped the next development of our country and Cromwell was a characteristic character in the split.
His accomplishments as the Lord’s Protector are also worthy of praise and recognition.”
Pig killer kills Chinese peasant farming
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, known as "Yuan", was found dead with a broken artery, full of blood at a market in the Pacific Ocean, Quzhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepared a vaccine for pigs in a stove on May 30, 2005, in West Ninh, Shandong, China.
He is said to have moved with his cousins from nearby Nanjing province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found out he was dead, and saw a pork door open next to him.
He said there was a large pork in the coffin with blood clots around the mummy.
A report from a medical examination confirmed that a 550-pound pig attacked the farmer to death.
“My brother’s legs are full of blood and no longer pure,” his cousin, known as “Wu,” wrote on Guiyang Evening News.
Images from the security camera showed Mr. Yuan had arrived at the market around 4.40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
About an hour later, he was found dead.
The killer pig is not a pig in the herd of two brothers.
A market manager shared with Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market’s governing body are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although not common, cases of human attack of pig have been recorded previously.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the husband to suffer serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig puts a Welsh farmer in his tractor until his wife threatens the animal to escape.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by pork in 2012, a Manitoba farmer shared on CBC News that pork is usually non-swine but the smell of blood can play the role of "sweet."
“They just want to get close.
“They were curious, curious... they didn’t want to hurt anyone.
You just need to look at them in the right direction,” he said.
The residue of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain on its surface to the southwest of the United States.
It is predicted that Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it travels to a cooler coastline on the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring floods across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa has a wind power of 85 mph, Storm Storm Level 1, counted at 05:00 EDT on Sunday, and is determined to be 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Hurricane Rosa will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure begins to form on the Pacific and moves east to the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday when a tropical storm forms, it will begin to bring much of the wetlands' temperatures to the Northwest.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, low-pressure humidity will cause heavy rainfall to spread in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause hazardous flooding, debris streams and the possibility of infestation in the desert.
Humidity temperatures will cause rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour at peaks, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
The projected rainfall ranges from 2 to 4 inches in the southwestern regions, especially in the vast area of Arizona.
Scans can occur when the situation deteriorates rapidly due to the widespread nature of tropical rainfall.
The situation would be extremely reassuring if it risked walking into the desert when there was a threat from tropical rains.
Heavy rains can make the mountain streams become violent rivers and storms will carry local winds and dusty swells.
Low pressures will bring some local heavy rainfall to many places on the Southern California coast.
The total rainfall can reach more than half an inch, easily causing dirt streams and slippery paths.
This will be the region’s first rainfall in the rainy season.
Some widespread tropical rains began pouring down to Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before rains became more common at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will hit Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Some extreme temperatures can be seen across the United States in October when the Arctic is colder, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in temperatures in localities close to each other.
A typical portfolio of significant temperature variations in the central U.S. region on Sunday.
The temperature difference is nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, a little warm summer, and the consultant will be re-created and reinforced again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. regions are expected to have a warm start in October with temperatures common around 80 in the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
New York City’s temperature can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, up from an average of about 10 degrees.
Long-term weather forecasts are showing that high-temperature probability will be above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 Million Followers of Brett Kavanaugh’s Naked Scene
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's screening on six television systems of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political turmoil continues, with television stations interrupting the regular broadcasting program with last-minute news on Friday: a deal made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an inquiry.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a quiet motion, said that he was 100% sure that it didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people have watched the nude, Nielsen said in a report on Friday.
The company has calculated the average number of viewers on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures are not yet included for other television channels including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often encounters some problems when calculating viewers in the office.
In order to determine the correlation, the number of audiences is similar to that of a final ticket contest or an Oscar.
Fox News, the show’s lead voiced strong support for Kavanaugh’s appointment, has led all castles with an average of 5.69 million viewers in the full-day viewing session, Nielsen shared.
ABC is second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
There is still a lot of concern after the funeral.
Flake is the central character in the Friday noise.
After the Republican figure just announced that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was monitored by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning that he was screamed by the protesters as he tried to move the elevator to the mosque.
He stood with his eyes straight down for a few minutes when questioned, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the whole country?"
He was convicted of “the man who has power while too many women are powerless.”
Flake spoke before the elevator shut down that his office had made a statement, that he would have a lot to say at the committee’s bareback session.
All cable and television stations were broadcasting hours later, when the Justice Commission would have to vote on whether Brett Kavanaugh was nominated.
But Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI would look into the charges against the candidates next week, which some in the Democratic minority had insisted.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his fellow Democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with the Coons and some senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was heavy, as it was clear that the Republican Party would not have Kavanaugh's approval vote without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May reaffirms 'political criticism' of Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May criticized plans to leave the European Union as a “political post” with Britain’s future and weakened national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party summit in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside her on the newspaper's single page, the Secretary of State, Boris Johnson, stressed his reluctance to their so-called Chequers deal with Brexit, arguing that the UK and EU proposal should be "unbiased".
Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old baseball player who plays for the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on second-level murder charges, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said the Sims had fallen glasses during the crash.
Police have detected glasses from the scene and said they have detected Simpson's DNA on glasses, according to CBS' WAFB report.
After interrogating Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde dead.
The guarantee was set at <0x24>350,000, the lawyer said.
The Baton Rouge Region Lethal Laboratory published a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of the death was a passing bullet from the head down to the neck.
The department is on the lookout for Louisiana State Police, the Escape Special Forces, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the University of Southern Police and local residents supporting the arrest.
LSU’s Physical Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement for “the role model and the pursuit of justice.”
Sims is only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-old senior grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played baseball for the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 kicks per game in the previous season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team had been "shocked" and "shocked" before Wayde's death.
Wade shared: "That's what you'll always have to watch out for."
Volcano moves to Mexico City
Sprayed from the volcano Popocatepetl flowed into the neighborhoods south of Mexico.
The National Anti-Earth Center warned Mexicans on Saturday that they should avoid volcanoes after the volcano’s mouth was active and they recorded 183 emissions and sludge within 24 hours.
The center has monitored a lot of volatility and vibration.
Images on social media show thin layers of turquoise covering windscreens in Mexico City’s neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Physicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-degree Richter earthquake in September 2017 smouldered central Mexico.
The volcano called "Don Goyo" has been operating since 1994.
Police clash with the Catalan separatist party before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters were in opposition to the anti-violence police, as thousands of protesters celebrated the first anniversary of Catalonia’s two-party votes on secession.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police with eggs and powder coatings, causing black dust clouds on the streets often crowded with tourists.
The war broke out at the end of the day when the police used claws to suppress the evacuation.
For hours, the independent supporters shouted "Don't forget, don't forgive" in front of protesters protesting the word, "Great Spain".
Fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain high in the region a year after the October 1 referendum was considered illegal with Madrid but was accepted by the Catalan separatists.
Voters in an independent direction occupy the island, although the support rate is low with those who are opposed to the divorce by a majority of voters quit the election.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the vote from taking place at polling stations in the region amid intense clashes.
Independent supporters have camped overnight on Friday to prevent a national police-supporting protest.
The protests took place earlier but were forced to take place with other events.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician attending a divorce demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia’s prospects of gaining independence.
“Last year we were going through the happiest moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy to be able to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite winning the key wins in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan independent supporters have struggled to keep up the momentum this year with many of their most famous leaders, who were either defeated or defeated.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who backed the police protest with her phone, said the conflict had been stalled by politicians on both sides.
“The story is getting more and more stressful,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison before trial since late last year, announced he would run for election in the European Parliament next year.
“To be a candidate for the European elections is the best way to accuse a decline in the democratic values and oppression that we have witnessed from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested When Cars Arrested Into Home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car continued to hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. BST.
Police investigating Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gates and the building itself.
There were gunshots in the car at some point.
Menga's squad brought a 1-0 win for Livingston ahead of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's previous lead helps Livingston win chances
Livingston is shocking to the Rangers as the Ibrox home team is led by Steven Gerrard with only two losses in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal scorer showed a difference when Gary Holt's side raised his hand against Hibernian in just a few seconds.
Gerrard's team have not yet won a separate table in the Premier League this season and faced the Hearts, the lead ahead of eight points, on Sunday.
Earlier, the Rangers received Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended his series of defeats in six games, with coach Holt still smelling failure since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed the opportunity to compete with the under-secret guest team
Holt's team should have led ahead before they scored, with their face-to-face tactics making the Rangers more difficult.
Scott Robinson was tight but overtook the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his efforts stronger after leading the ball to Craig Halkett on the cross-country.
The homeowners are confident that the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can trouble the team with personal techniques.
And that's the strategy for set scores.
The Rangers made for a penalty kick and Livingston led ahead, Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated towards Menga, who had the ball touch and scored right in the middle of the ball.
At the moment, the Rangers have taken over the ball, but notice that the defensive line is invincible and Liam Kelly's goalkeeper is barely in trouble.
The battle continued in the second round, although Alfredo Morelos received help from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed under the legs of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow switched to another Livingston play script.
The ball phases continued into the frame of Livingston and were continuously summed up, when there were two temple penalties - after Halkett's challenge to the substitute Glenn Middleton, one for a touchdown on the ball - were all blocked successfully.
'Labels' with Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A result and a satisfying match for Livingston.
The team is very good, continuing to climb far ahead in the reverse line.
Their playing style and players have rarely changed since they returned to the top, but the status must be significant for Holt because of the way he grinded the team since he appeared.
You have too many strong players.
Captain Halkett is the general, arranging a superbly organized defensive line, while Menga constantly keeps the feet of Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As in Gerrard’s time, they didn’t meet those standards.
The final draw lacks – the only opportunity to open the home team’s section – and that’s a warning for the Rangers, the star-responding team in the middle of the table.
Erdogan Receives Multiple Shades of Grey in Cologne
There were smiles and favorable weather on Saturday (29th of July) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – aimed at consolidating relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to attend the ceremony in a newly-sized Muslim church.
The city is home to the largest population of Turkey outside of Turkey.
The hospital police cited security reasons to stop a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the Islamic Church, but many supporters were also nearby to meet their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also protested, denouncing both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The bipartisan demonstrations reflected the division of a guest praised as a hero of some Turkish people in Germany and being challenged by others as a privileged guest.
Deptford Accident: Bicycle rider killed in car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the three Bestwood and Evelyn roads, a submerged neighborhood in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the medical staff arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed in a car crash and ran off Childers Road, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
Police said they were working to identify the man and notify his relatives.
The road was blocked and the bus was transferred and the participants were advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Violence
Six employees were injured in a violent incident in a prison for the male offender with strict security, the prison official said.
The riots erupted at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. BST on Sunday morning and are still ongoing.
The “Tornado” specialists were brought to deal with the war, ending around 5:30 p.m.
Officers were spotted on the scene with small wounds.
A spokesman for the Prison Board said: "Special training camp staff have been deployed to deal with what is happening at HMP Long Lartin.
Six injured employees have been treated.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that the persons involved will be transferred to the police and may spend more time after the parade.”
HM Long Lartin prison detains more than 500 prisoners, including the nation’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the detainee was treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, anti-violence officers were summoned to prison to deal with a serious uprising in which employees were attacked with balloons.
Pink Storm Threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Transient Storm Floods (Storm Areas That Can Be Benefited)
Very rarely, low temperatures attack Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen at the beginning of the next week when the power outages of Hurricane Rosa in the Southwestern desert are still at risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Department released flood monitoring on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to follow a straight line across Phoenix on Tuesday, but earlier on Monday night it had rained.
The National Meteorological Department in Phoenix has mentioned in a missing report that only "ten tropical tornadoes have formed tropical hurricanes or low tropical pressure within 200 miles of landing in Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of landing at the Arizona border.
The latest forecast model from the National Storm Center predicts rainfall heights of about 2 to 4 inches, with flood rates separating up to 6 inches at the Mogollon Belt in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwestern Desert include the central Rockies and the Earthquakes are likely to sink from 1 to 2 inches, with segregated flooding levels of up to 4 inches.
With the areas that are not flooded suddenly, the rain from Hurricane Rosa can be good as the area is drowning.
Although flooding is a profound concern, some waterfalls may still be happy to accept because the Southeast is suffering from drowning.
According to weather.com, the U.S. Swelling Monitoring Agency said that only more than 40 percent of Arizona’s regions are experiencing the lowest levels of extreme drowsiness, but are still the second highest in the same category.
First, the Rosa Smoke Trail passes through leaving the ground scattered across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still in the hurricane range with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, 385 miles, and moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm must have cooler sea currents in the Pacific Ocean and weakened.
As a result, it is predicted that there will be landslides in Mexico as low tropical pressures pass through Monday afternoon.
Rainfall in areas in Mexico may be significant, indicating the possibility of flooding is not small.
According to Weather.com, “The total estimated rainfall from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora can be up to 10 inches.”
Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border early on Tuesday as a tropical low pressure, then scan across Arizona and land in southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
“The main dangers predicted from Rosa or its excess are very large rainfall in Baja California, Northwest Sonora and the Southwest desert of the United States,” the National Storm Center said.
These rains are expected to cause flooding and flooding that endangered the lives of deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Public Torn at Midsomer Norton: Four suspects who deliberately murdered have been arrested
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old was found to have been beaten in Somerset.
The boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at about 4 a.m. BST on Saturday morning.
He was taken to the hospital in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officers have called on people to come to the ER if they can keep any footage related to the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh “resisted the egotism, anger” of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the Democratic Party’s overly ruthless tactics,” Trump said during a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “resisted the egotism, anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his election.
Kavanaugh opposed Congress on Thursday, strongly denying and declaring an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades before they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the bare trial of her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed the excellence and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm that one of the most misguided legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a weak schedule, serves the true public,” he told a crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The president mentioned details of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke of the importance of voting for the Republican party in the midterm elections.
There are only five weeks left to be one of the most important elections in my life.
“I’m not an executive, but I’m an executive,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere to fight for bright candidates.”
Trump said the Democratic Party was trying to “restrict and hinder.”
The first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican leader’s assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths due to earthquakes, divine waves in Indonesia, more damage
At least 384 people have been killed, many of whom have been reported to have flown as giant waves crashed down the beaches, as an earthquake and a massive wave landed on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island, officials said on Saturday.
Hundreds gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to six metres (18 feet) hit the shores at the time of the wedding, sweeping many dead and destroying everything along its way.
The wave followed a strong 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the threat of the divine wave appeared yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities on the beach and did not leave immediately and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency (BNPB), said in a statement.
"The wave didn't come on its own, it pulled cars, wood, doors, scanned everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the wave had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before landing.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the storm and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Images taken from the air by the disaster agency revealed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were torn down and collapsed, and a Muslim cathedral drowned in the water.
The surplus storms continued to vibrate the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes have been observed in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Price and Technological Approach (BPPT) said in a statement that according to the energy source released by Friday's strong earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb that fell on the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the wave, according to the announcement.
Nugroho described the damage as "too big" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the demolition of buildings collapsed, he said, 540 more were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the deaths and damage could not stop along the 300 km (190 miles) coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, near the heart of the quake.
The media is "completely paralysed with no news" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, saying that its staff and volunteers are coming to the affected areas.
“It’s been a tragedy, but the tragedy can become much more terrible,” they said.
The agency was widely condemned on Saturday for not informing that the tide had reached Palu, although officials said the tide had arrived at the time of warning.
In an unprofessional film posted on social media, it’s possible to hear a man standing on top screaming panic for those on the way to the nearing wave of God.
A few minutes later, a wall of water flooded the shore, scanning buildings and cars.
Reuters hasn’t confirmed the film yet.
Earthquakes and earthquakes have caused a massive power loss that disrupted the communications surrounding Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials said the military had begun to dispatch freighter aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but refugees still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit refugee centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of people in the Indonesian Divine Wave has increased to more than 800.
It's a very bad form.
While World Vision staff came from Donggala to the city of Palu safely, where the staff were in the office-built sheds, they had gone through the devastating scenery on the road, Doseba said.
“They told me that they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when aid groups started significant moves when they started disaster relief tools, some people complained that high-skilled foreign relief workers were prevented from moving to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, private and foreign personnel can only begin to be implemented if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened.
“This is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government decides, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can be ready with international support but have no speech yet.”
When they landed on Palu on the second night after the earthquake and the Friday wave, the friends and family of those still missing were hoping that their loved ones would be the magic to capture the horrific stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled up from the pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman trapped under a pile of rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesian national batsman coach, has coached two of the missing batsmen for the Asian Games, which was held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including the British Mandagi, were his pupils.
“As an ex-husband in the field of pornography, I carry the burden of my own emotions,” he said.
Gendon said that within hours of the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread in the crowded community, he was desperately texting via WhatsApp to rivals in Palu, who were attending the beach festival.
However, his message indicated that there was a gray pile instead of two blue piles.
“I think that means that the messages weren’t sent,” he said.
The robbers took away <0x24>26,750 when the ATM was deposited at Newport in Levee.
According to reports from the Newport Police Department, the robbers took <0x24>26,750 from a Brink bank employee while they were depositing money at an ATM in Newport in Levee.
The driver on board the car cleaned the ATM tree in the entertainment area and prepared for extra money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the article.
When he was busy, a man "came from behind Brink's staff" and took away the money bag that had to be delivered.
According to the report, witnesses saw many suspected bandits around the scene, but police have not yet identified the number of subjects involved in the case.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the suspect is concerned please contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He wrote in a tweet on Saturday: “Before people know me, I’m Kanye West.”
West, 41, named Ye for a while and used it as the eighth album to be released in June.
The change took place before he appeared on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He was a guest on the show instead of Dr. Ariana Grande when she called herself "emotional disorder," the show's creator said.
Just as the abbreviation in his current name art, West has previously said this word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe that the word "ye" is the most commonly used in the Bible and in the Bible this word means "you," West shared earlier this year, when talking about the title of his album with Big Boy broadcasters.
"So I'm a friend, I'm us, it's us.
The transition from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye - the reflection of good, evil, turning, everything.
The album is more than our own reflection.
He was one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is widely known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he was targeting Love and Brother Love.
An artist who once collaborated with West, JAY-Z, was also wondering whether or not to have a horizontal tile mark and write flowers.
Mexico’s president says he won’t bring troops against civilians.
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has declared that he will never use military force against civilians as the country commemorates the 50th anniversary of the bloodthirsty revenge on students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "never bring down the Mexican people's oppressive army."
The military fired in a peaceful protest on the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 at the time as the student movements were raging across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening up more free public universities.
He shared that the problem of unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led to the example of young people being caught up in the misfortunes.
The U.S. should double the A.I. aid.
As China became more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount for research in the field, investors and practitioners of AI Kai-Fu Lee, who once worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, shared.
The comments were made after various departments of the U.S. government issued notices about AI, even while the U.S. overall is lacking an official AI strategy.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year: the goal of making the country the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Increasing the budget for AI research will be a positive start, as all other countries are losing far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubled spending could double the chance that the next huge AI achievement will be made in the United States, Lee shared with CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book "Super-energy Artificial Intelligence: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Executive Director of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in one of the most prominent AI<0x2B>Face companies.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked at an AI system that beat Othello players in the U.S. with the highest rankings, then he was CEO at Microsoft Research and head of Google in China.
Lee approaches previous U.S. government technology contests such as Advanced Project Research Agency’s Challenge Machines and concerns about when the next contest will take place, to help determine the next vision.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government help, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s calling for all the leading scholars; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired bright stars from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee shares changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its AI efforts.
He added, "I think the green card should be automatically awarded to doctors on AI."
The Chinese National Institutes has released its next-generation Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee added: China’s National Science Foundation provides support to those who belong to similar academic institutions as the way the Foundation and other government institutions donate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of research in China is lower.
Earlier this year in the United States, the U.S. Department of State established a Creative Intelligence Alliance Center, aimed at interfering with partners from industry and education, and the White House announced the establishment of the Artificial Intelligence Selection Committee.
This month, the Directorate of Advanced Defence Research Projects announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
At the National Science Foundation, they currently invest more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law has sought to establish a National Security Council on Human Intelligence but has not seen any movement in months.
Macedonians voted in referendum on changing the country’s name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday about whether to change its name to the “North Republic of Macedonia” – a decades-long dispute resolution with Greece aimed at preventing accession to NATO and the European Union.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has confirmed that the name of its northern neighbor corresponds to its own territory and has ruled out NATO and EU membership.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the new name proposed, but opposition to nationalism said the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Slavs in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a vegan campaign raised doubts as to whether voters would meet at least 50% of the demands for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the popular ballot reads: “You agree to become a member of NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece.”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said it was a price to pay to pursue the accession of institutions such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of the Peninsula.
Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje, said: "Today I come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can freely enjoy the protection of the European Union because it aims at a safer life for all of us."
Although members of parliament are not legally bound, they have said they will comply with the voting results to make a decision.
The change of name will require two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The National Electoral Commission said there were no reports of abnormalities until 1 a.m.
However, the voter turnout reached only 16%, compared to 34% in last year’s parliamentary election, with 66% voting.
Elector Gjose Tanevski, 62, in the capital Skopje, shared: "I vote for my children, because our position is in Europe."
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country’s name, which would pave the way for NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of Congress in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is preparing a small bucket and pulling chairs in front of a tent erected by those who would veto the referendum.
Kavadarkov said: “We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join the main road, not through the backdoor.”
“We are a poor country, but we are poor for cleanliness.
If they don’t see us as Macedonia, then we can move to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Asia-European alliance.”
Prime Minister Zaev said as a member of NATO, he would bring very urgent investments to Macedonia, where there is a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I believe that most of us will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He shared that a "approvement" result would be "affirmation for our future."
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said about 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - lower than the compulsory vote.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, said 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they voted in favour.
A successful referendum has to have a voting rate of 50 percent and one vote.
Failure in the referendum marked the first serious blow to Western government policy since it took place in May last year.
Follow-up: Sergio Aguero at Manchester City has crossed all of Brighton's defensive ranks to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defensive squad with Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero represented the class with a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine player received a line from the middle of the field when he started to lead the ball.
He glided in front of the three guards of Brighton before breaking into the empty yard.
Then Aguero finds himself surrounded by four blue players.
He skated up a defender before stopping the other opponents on the edge of Brighton.
The line to the left, leading the ball straight to Sterling.
The British recruit led his first ball strike in a banning round for Aguero, who blew his right foot with a shot to knock down Brighton's Mathew Ryan from the right side of the net.
Coach Pep Guardiola told reporters: "Aguero has suffered some leg injuries."
“We’re talking about just letting him play for about 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have him scored at the time.”
But it was Sterling who brought the first advantage to the players of the Green Leather in the fight at the UK Open."
He scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the lead deep into Brighton's field during the match.

Scherzer wants to burn himself to the Rockies.
With the Nationals being eliminated from the last round of ticket prices, there weren’t many reasons to start over.
But a warrior Scherzer hopes to win the playground on Sunday with the Colorado Rockies, but this is only meaningful when the Rockies, the lead team ahead of a game with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, are still playing.
The Rockies won at least a quarter-final with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to keep the top army position.
"While playing is meaningless, at least we are thrown into the ball when we learn about the atmosphere in Denver along with the crowd and the other teams will play with any of the highest levels I can play this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play in a game like this?
The Nationals have not yet announced the player's screening in Sunday's match, but Scherzer appears to be exploding in this situation.
Scherzer, who kicked his 34th start, will have a bowling practice on Thursday and play on his Sunday holiday.
The Washington team’s right hand scored 18-7 with 2.53 ERA (average run) and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 games this season.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The president has mentioned the details of the situation around his Supreme Court, elected Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of voting for the Republican party in midterm elections.
“Everything we do has potential in November.
There are only five weeks left to be one of the most important elections in my life.
"This is one of the big, big things - not an election, but there's a reason why I'm going everywhere to fight for bright candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You’ll see the Democratic Party’s negativity, the negativity, are in existence right now.
And they're determined to suppress power by using any step, and then you'll see selfishness, step.
They don’t care who hurts, they have to step up to gain power and control, they just want to gain power and control, and we won’t give them that.”
He added, “Democrats are trying to ‘restrict and hinder’.
"You've seen that for the last four days." He added, claiming that the Democratic Party was "rage and selfish and biased and lying."
He pointed out that the Senate Judiciary Committee recognized Senator Dianne Feinstein, who had been appalled from the bottom.
“Do you remember her answer? . . .
Would you let me know?
How's that?
No, no, I was expecting - that's a not-so-excellent body language - but it's actually the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer an open party.
Expressing opinions is unacceptable.
I’m not surprised when the activists of Momentum, in my local party, voted to check me out.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs to be informed that I am not welcome – because I have commented.
Also a member of parliament with me, Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she was resolutely in favour of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the navigating movement was aimed at me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a large-scale economic policy, on national security, in Europe, issues similar to those that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday announced that "we want meetings that are inclusive and effective."
For nearly eight years as a deputy for the local Labour Party, the Friday evening leadership meetings were held in this manner.
Sadly, today, it’s not the voice in many meetings and the promise of a “more polite, gentler” policy has been forgotten for a long time and really whether that’s ever started.”
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and all opinions are assessed consistently as to whether or not the party leaders are acceptable.
This started right after Jeremy became a leader, because my previous colleagues thought that the political consensus with me had begun to expect me to change my mind and take positions that I would never approve - whether on national security or the EU market direction.
Whenever I make a public statement – and indeed whatever I say – to follow the abuses on social media calling for the elimination, the central political charge tells me that I should not join the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one who thinks so.
Actually, I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues because comments made to me bring a political trend.
I was surprised by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who faced the flow of gender-discriminatory abuse or racial discrimination every day but never avoided.
One of the most deplorable aspects of this political age is the level of abuse that has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The fact that we are no longer that wide-open Party and with every “untrustworthy” move or change in the rules of choice, the Party has become narrower.
I’ve had a lot of advice over the past two years about encouraging me to keep calm, don’t say too many words, and then I’ll be fine.
But that's not why I'm involved in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was just a boy, I was driven by the illusion that the Thatcher government was, which literally caused my entire school to collapse, I have sought to provide better services to those in need - or even to those in need.
I have never concealed my political views, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be misunderstood about my political positions and my disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who pushed for the move on Friday, all I want to share is when the country fills itself with Brexit, which will hurt our families, businesses and public services, I don’t want to waste my time and energy on the oven.
But in reality, a message outside Nottingham Momentum that I keep in mind, sent to my voters, whether or not I’m a Labour Party member: I’m proud to be served and I promise that there will be no threat of elimination or any kind of political means to stop me.
Chris Leslie is a member of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38–17 Melrose: Ayr defeated the lead
Two attempts later may have made a mistake in the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this well-established Tennent Premiership match of the day.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only conspicuous king in ten teams.
That said, it’s also their super-class defense, as well as much as a better chance for them, bringing home team and coach Peter Murchie absolutely right to be satisfied.
"So far, we've been through our games so far and we're still unbeaten, so I'm happy."
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said: “Accept Ayr, they’re capturing better opportunities than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute score, scored by Frazier Climo, led Ayr ahead, but, a gold card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, opened the game for the Warriors, allowing Melrose to showcase his hand and Jason Baggot to score a ball.
Climo had led Ayr with a temple penalty, before, right in union one, he scored an extra point then with a solo phase raising the number to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose started to merge the two favorably and Patrick Anderson publicly, Baggot scored an extra point, shortening the percentage down to five points.
After a long period of serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was relegated, and since the restart, Ayr has led ahead with Stafford McDowall's public scoring, Climo scored an extra point.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was then given a gold card, and once again, Melrose made the sub-player with Bruce Colvine's pointless scoring, in front of a stressful pressure.
However, the home team was back, and when Struan Hutchinson was awarded a gold card for facing Climo without a ball, from the temple bar, MacPherson scored on Ayr's support advantage.
Climo scored another score, as he had done almost since re-releasing, after Kyle Rowe received David Armstrong's shot and led to the runner-up Gregor Henry after the home team's fifth score.

‘The coast is ours’: Bolivia’s non-sea-shield nation hopes court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The sailors searched a naval headquarters equipped in La Paz.
Public buildings are all hung with the green flags of the sea.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon were all painted with the slogan: “The sea is our right.
“The sea is our mission.”
Every corner of Bolivia’s land, the memory of a coast lost to Chile during the bloody 19th-century conflict, is still alive – as is the desire to sail the Pacific once again.
Those hopes are probably the most burning in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the judgement of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, said: “Bolivia is motivated, united and calm, and of course expects in a positive view of the outcome.”
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ's ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will support Bolivia's statement that - after decades of tense talks - Chile has the obligation to negotiate a peace treaty.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s convincing prime minister, who faces a heinous debate for re-election next year – there are also many statements in the verdict on Monday.
At the end of August, he resolutely said, "We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean."
But some analysts argue that the court is unlikely to decide in favour of Bolivia – and this is unlikely to change.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to pay for Chile and has ruled that they will not determine the outcome of potential exchanges.
The ICJ’s ruling came just six months after the final debates showed the situation was “uncomplicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And further, Bolivia’s prosecution, which in the last four years could be reversed.
Zarate said: “The problem of access to the sea has been attacked by the current Bolivian government.”
She added that Mr. Morales’ declarations of war have shut down all Chile’s remaining goodwill.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiating with each other, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, Bolivia’s representative at The Hague, rejected the view that the court’s decision was quickly unusual.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new era for relations with Chile" and an opportunity to end 139 years of mutual disagreement," he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales – still one of the most famous presidents in Latin America – is using maritime issues as a political lifesaver.
Bolivia added: “Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific.”
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we need to step through the past.”
North Korea says there will never be a nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, has revealed that his country will never dismantle nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington in the past.
Mr. Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises at a summit in Singapore between the two leaders.
He noted that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be preparing to restart nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Mr. Ri said it was a "horrible dream" to continue the U.S. sanctions and opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean War to make North Korea fall.
Washington is cautiously agreeing with the statement that without Pyongyang it would make significant moves to demobilize the weapons first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are looking forward to a second summit.
But there is little doubt that Pyongyang is very serious about giving up a stockpile of weapons that the country may consider to be the only way to ensure security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion Paris unveils the latest product line of wide-open hats that are about to surround the big streets near you
If you want to collect your hats or completely stay away from the sun, you don’t have to look far.
Valentino and Thom Browne reveal a range of other odd-sized head-to-head team designs in their SS19 collection on the track that will stir the design style at Paris Fashion Week.
The high-appliance hats scanned Instagram this summer and the above-mentioned designers brought their creativity to the stage.
Valentino’s highlight is a beige-colored top-open stranded hat that is attached to wrist-like accessories, covering the model’s head.
Other oversized accessories include walnuts, witch hats, and even a peanut – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also reveals a series of bizarre masks – right or in time for Halloween.
Many lipstick masks are sewn in the same style as Hannibal Lecter rather than high-end fashion.
One design resembles a complete sea diving device with breathable tubes and protective glasses, and another device resembles a melting pot.
And if you continue to catch up with the giant fashion trends - then you're lucky.
The tone of the tomb predicts that large earbuds may be covering the waves across the large streets near you.
The large hats became hot on the ‘La Bomba’ shoe boots, the several-ton wide-stranded hat that Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski wore.
The funerary brand behind the extremely unrealistic hat exploded across social media has brought another great innovation to the stage – a bag that goes to the beach near the beach with a bathing suit.
The flame-resistant orange rafting fiber bag, lined with rafting fiber with a white leather handle, is a highlight in Jacquemus’s La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous model maker Luke Armitage shares with FEMAIL: ‘I expect to see large-scale seafaring hats and bags plunging into large streets next summer – because the designer has created such a huge impact that it’s hard to overlook the demands.
John Edward: Foreign Language Skills are Essential for Global Citizens
The private schools in Scotland continue to maintain their excellent academic standing, the event continued in 2018 with a series of commendable learning outcomes, reinforced by both individuals and groups on sports, arts, music and community-based activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools are funded by the Scottish Schools Association (SCIS), which is striving to provide the best quality of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to equip deep and broad knowledge, as well as orient their students’ careers and status as global citizens.
As a discipline of education that can design and run the school’s hostile curriculum, we see modern foreign languages continue to be a popular and chosen topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in the language he understands, things that are said will go into his mind.
If you talk to him in his own language, things that are said will go into his feelings.”
This is a convincing message that we don’t just rely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent exams this year, we can see that foreign languages are leading in the rankings with the highest scores in the private field.
A total of 68 percent of foreign-language students scored higher than A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored A-scores in Chinese, plus 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish.
This suggests that private schools in Scotland are heading towards foreign-language considerations as essential skills that children and adolescents will not be able to have in the future.
Optional foreign language studies are being considered as the main STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum at private schools as well as those elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the National Council for Engineering and Business found that among the reasons employers find it difficult to find people, it was due to a lack of foreign language skills.
As a result, foreign language skills are becoming more and more practical in order to equip young people to enter the career path in the future.
With more opportunities for career prospects needing a foreign language, these skills become practical in an increasingly flatter world.
No matter how people choose to work, if they learn a second language, they will get a real advantage in the future when they have such a lifelong skill.
If you can communicate directly in the language of the natives themselves, a multilingual person will obviously lead every challenge.
According to a survey by YouGov of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them could not practice a simple passage in another foreign language, and only French was the only foreign language with a percentage of a single number, 15 percent.
That’s why investing in foreign language teaching is essential for children today.
Taking into the hands of multilinguals, especially the languages of emerging economies, will equip children with the brighter potential in finding a real job.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
Some schools will focus on more modern foreign languages, while others will teach foreign languages that are considered important to the UK in the 2020 vision, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever the child likes, there are also a variety of foreign languages to choose from within the range of private schools, along with a team of teachers with expertise in the profession.
The private schools in Scotland focus on providing an educational environment that prepares and equips children with essential skills for success, no matter what the future is hiding.
It cannot be denied that, in an international business environment, foreign languages will continue to be an extremely important factor for the future of the country, which should be broadened in education.
In fact, modern foreign languages should be regarded as "international communication skills."
Private schools will continue to give this opportunity to young people in Scotland: diversity and expulsion.
There can be no other choice.
John Edward is the Director of the Board of the Scottish School of Communication.
LeBron in the lead at the Lakers last Sunday in San Diego.
Expectations are coming to an end for fans who want to see LeBron James play the first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in a pre-season game with the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But how long you’ll be in the game hasn’t been determined.
Walton said on Lakers' official website: "It will be in just under 48 minutes."
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said it was likely that James would participate in the match for a limited time.
Following the trainings this week, James was asked about the schedule for six pre-season games at the Lakers.
“I don’t need to play a few starts before the season at this stage of my career anymore.
TT. Trump's campaign in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
Tonight, in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump began the campaign.
This was the first stop on the journey of TT’s five campaigns. Trump next week, including stopping in backing states such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
The standard vote for the candidate he nominated for in the vacant seat of the Supreme Court is being postponed, President Trump is trying to argue for support before the upcoming midterm election, when the Republican Party is in the forefront of the Eleventh Amendment.
Trump’s campaign in West Virginia started at what time tonight and how can you watch it online?
TT. Trump’s campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia is expected to begin at 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow TT’s campaign. Trump in West Virginia is streamed live on YouTube.
President Trump may be referring to this week’s bareback by Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s candidate, who is currently facing allegations of sexual assault and a vote of approval by the Senate to postpone a week’s FBI prosecution.
However, the main purpose of these crowded campaigns was to attract the supporters of the Republican Party’s supporters before the November election.
According to Reuters, the target of the campaign through five campaigns next week is "to strengthen volunteers and Republican supporters in the race to defend and expand the majority of the votes they hold in the Senate and Senate".
“Congress control is an important issue in the agenda, so the president will visit as many states as possible before entering the busy election season,” a campaign spokesman for the TT said in a statement.
The project, which will take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling City, could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, while at the same time attracting Pittsburgh media to the news," West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday will be TT’s second visit last month to West Virginia, the state he won by 40% in 2016.
TT. Trump is trying to support Patrick Morrisey, Republican candidate for West Virginia State Senator, as he is currently behind the polls.
According to Reuters, citing Simon Haeder, a political science researcher at the University of West Virginia: “The fact that the president has to visit the state to argue for the vote for the candidate is not a good sign with Morrisey.”
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is determined to hold the Cup in singles matches on Sunday
After three matches of imbalance, a double match on Saturday afternoon may be necessary for the Ryder Cup.
Turning the wrist in the style of a kick to train is an entirely new sport concept, but it’s also an action that athletes really trust, especially in games like this one.
So where is the current momentum?
“They lead ahead of six points, the flight is only four, and I think that’s the motivation for us,” said Jordan Spieth on a relaxed ride.
Of course, the European team has an advantage, leading 4 points, and they have 12 more matches.
As Spieth said, the U.S. team still had a little hope and they were very encouraged, especially with the match between Spieth and Justin Thomas. These two teams have played many times and each one had three points.
Spieth was an ex-player of balls playing from ball position to balls and he always led as a mirror.
The shouts of joy grew more and more as he came to his round, especially the ball kicking to take off the match as he and Thomas, in turn, poled the ball in the hole.
The match-winning scoring on the 15th is the same, which means that he has full confidence in the U.S. team’s reverse-league strike.
Spieth said: "You have to think carefully and worry about your own game."
All the athletes are gone.
There are 18 holes left to score.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undeniable legend of the Ryder Cup, were the only couple to have scored higher than Spieth and Thomas.
This strange but significant pair of European teams have won 4:0 and can't make a mistake.
"Moliwood" is the only pair that does not beat the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoids the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and knocks the beetle on Friday morning.
That victory and the source of energy from them spread to the crowd of thermal fans that made people feel that the two of them were their own rivals who needed to defeat on Sunday; and no more champions deserved to be on Fleetwood or Molinari to defend the National Golf team's victory at the time.
Hopefully both of them will appear at the same time in different holes.
However, it’s still too early to confirm the European team’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball series in the morning, when competing against Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes caused the Spaniards and Sweden to completely lose their chances of counterattack.
On Sunday, no one was able to pull them out of that failure.
The fourball and foursome games are always the most worth watching because of the interactions between the pairs, their advice and watching the game strategy change only in the rules.
The European team competed better and led a long way ahead of the final day of the match, but this foursome series shows the American team still had a chance to win.
European team lead ahead of 10-6 before the Ryder Cup final day starts
The European team will take advantage of the Ryder Cup’s final day after the spectacular fourball and foursome series, leading ahead of the American team 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead by winning two Tiger Woods matches to win an additional 4 points on the Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn of the European team, determined to win the cup again to lose to your team at Hazeltine two years ago, had defeated the American side in the morning fourball match, leading ahead 3-1.
The U.S. team competed better in the foursome series, winning two games, but could not win the final.
Jim Furyk’s team needed up to 8 points in the Sunday singles series to win the cup again.
Fleetwood was the first European player to score four points in a row when he and Molinari, commonly referred to as the "Molliwood" pair, were the second pair after the tragic weekends of matches that have won four points in four opener games in history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball match, they had a more convincing win ahead of Woods and U.S. freshman Bryson Decambeau with a score of 5&4.
Woods played two games on Saturday and sometimes had bright moments, but so far, he has lost 19/29 games in the fourball and foursome series, including 7 consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, after resting in the morning fourball series, returned with Henrik Stenson in the foursome, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the two world-class 1st and 3rd champions, with a 2&1.
However, even though the weather in southwestern Paris was very pleasant, the European team did not have an easy day of competition.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored an important goal for the U.S. team with two points on Saturday.
They had won a convincing 2&1 win over Spanish forward Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball match, and then continued to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a score of 4&3 in the foursome, despite missing the first 2 goals.
In Ryder Cup history, only twice a team led ahead of 4 points could start the singles matches, however, the Furyk team just needed to hold the cup.
After only being considered second in two days, Sunday is likely to become a backlash for the team.
North Korea declares 'no-life' unilateral disarmament in lack of trust
North Korea's foreign minister, speaking to the United Nations on Saturday, said sanctions are still being maintained, deepening their suspicions about the United States, and in this situation, none of the country is unilaterally giving up arms.
Ri Yong Ho spoke at the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly, saying that North Korea has implemented "many willful measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear and non-proliferation bases and missile tests.
“However, we don’t see the same movement from the United States,” he said.
“If we can’t trust the U.S. side, we won’t be able to confidently guarantee national security, and in such a situation, we’ll never have the same solution before.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea’s usual complaint that Washington refused to dismantle nuclear weapons “by stage” and that North Korea would benefit from taking the same precaution, his remarks in this case were not as good.
Mr. Ri referred to a joint statement by Mr. Kim Jong-un and Mr. Donald Trump at the first summit between a senior U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Mr. Trump said in a statement that he was "committed to compromise."
North Korea is still trying to find a way to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. has insisted that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to calls for a loosening of the international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States insists on the 'pre-disposal of nuclear weapons' and increased pressure by sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, even against the 'declaration of an end to the war'," Ri said.
“The point is that sanctioning can make us crawl to the knees is just the dream of those who don’t understand anything about us.
But the problem here is that the sanctions that are still maintaining this continue to lose our trust.”
Ri did not mention the plan to hold the second summit between President Kim and President Trump as the U.S. leader presented at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the foreign minister referred to three meetings between President Kim and President Moon Jae-in last month and added: “If the negotiating party negotiates a nuclear-weapon-free deal, it would not be the U.S. to negotiate a nuclear-weapon-free deal.”
However, Ri’s voice was quite different from last year, when he said before the General Assembly that North Korea’s launching missiles into the U.S. was inevitable in a suicide mission after Trump called him “The Killer.”
Last year at the United Nations, Trump threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, but this year ends his congratulations to Kim for bravely taking steps to disarm him, but Trump also stressed that there is still a lot to be done and sanctions are still needed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set a deadline for this: "Six years, three years, or just five months is no problem."
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should pay tribute to Pyongyang for their efforts.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday told the UN Security Council that “the Security Council’s sanctions must continue to be implemented in a strong and unconvincing manner until we can confirm the outcome, with certainty.”
The Security Council has agreed to step up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Secretary of State Pompeo has summoned Secretary of State Ri to formal meetings of the UN General Assembly and said he will visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the final result of his visit is unlikely.
He left Pyongyang after a visit in July and said the talks had made some progress, but just hours later, North Korea accused the foreign minister of making “requests like black society.”
North Korea has pledged to attend a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-In this month to dismantle a missile test base and a nuclear complex if the U.S. has "similar conditions."
He said President Kim directed that the “similar situation” he is looking for is the security assurance that Trump has pledged during the talks in Singapore and is advancing to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take full-time rest courses.
In an effort to combat machine-pressure learning culture, with ‘night-students’ drinking water-replacement coffee, a new course at Harvard University this year has encouraged all college students to sleep more.
Students studying at this world’s number one university often don’t know the basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard University of Medicine, is also a specialist at the Women's Hospital and Brigham is the one who designed this course and himself believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration to start this course comes after he participated in a talk about the impact of lack of sleep on the learning process.
“After the conversation ended, a student girl came to me and said, ‘Why did you know this until the last year?’
She said no one told her about the importance of sleep, which really surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course introduced for the first time this year, explaining to students the importance of good sleep habits helps improve learning and sports outcomes, while improving their overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical University who serves as the university’s chief executive of health services, said the school decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were severely lacking sleep during the week.
The one-hour course covers a range of interactive assignments.
In the section there are pictures of the hostel, in which students can click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise machines and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, light and sleep deprivation that affects the results of exercise, as well as the weight of exercise.
On the other hand, participants learned how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, the university campus map, with interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“We know that this course cannot immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe that you have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health impact when choosing tobacco,” Professor Czeisler added.
“The proud culture of ‘students of the night’ still exists, while modern technologies and increasing pressure on students leading to sleep deprivation are an increasingly serious issue.
Ensuring adequate sleep, good sleep quality should become a student’s ‘secret weapon’ to counteract stress, fatigue and anxiety – even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to fall into a state of hunger and starvation.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California studying biochemistry, chemistry, and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design this course, while also attending one of the classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course helped him ‘open his eyes’ and inspired his efforts to call for a course across the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to suggest all postgraduate studies to participate in a similar curriculum before starting to compete in the main course.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider setting alarms when going to sleep, waking hours, and at the same time need to be aware of the harmful ‘blue light’ emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which may cause your biological rhythm disturbances, leading to difficulty sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga defeats Gerrard's boys
The Rangers had an unsuccessful match day when Dolly Menga's counter-attack caused Steven Gerrard's team to lose 1-0 to Livingston.
The Ibrox team hopes to score their first win since Premier's 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as head coach, pulling Hebron's Heartship away.
Menga retained the offensive seven minutes before the end of the 1st round, but the Rangers’ gas seemed to have never been hit.
The Rangers have now fallen to 6th place, while Livingston has climbed to 3rd place, and only after Hibernian to the table difference.
And the Rangers had to deal with another problem after the Calum Spence referee had to treat the head wound after an object was clearly thrown from the front of the guest yard.
Gerrard changed the squad eight times compared to the squad who had crossed Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt retained the Livi 11 and scored a point in front of the Hearts team last week and he must have been extremely happy with how his students occupy the opponents in each attack.
Although the Rangers hold more balls, Livingston is the really dangerous team when it comes to balls.
They deserved to score just two minutes after Menga first put Scott Pittman on the pitch, attacking Allan McGregor’s frame but this goalkeeper missed this opportunity.
A deep shot by Keaghan Jacobs brought the ball to Captain Craig Halkett's leg, but defender Alan Lithgow could only bring the ball out the column behind the frame.
The Rangers took control of the ball on the pitch, but their way of playing was mostly based on hope rather than trust, especially in 1/3 of the final time.
Alfredo Morelos is sure to say that he should be penalized for his and Steven Lawless collisions, but the referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian player’s appeal.
The Rangers only scored twice in the 1st round, but former Ibrox player Liam Kelly had hardly any difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's counterattack.
Although Livi’s opening of the number in the 34th minute is thought to be an advantage, no one can deny that their win is totally deserving.
Again, the Rangers couldn’t handle Jacobs’ deep-bound kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher kicked the ball for Scott Robinson, while Scott quietly chose Menga to make a simple finish.
Gerrard immediately had the option during the break, by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and this replacing almost immediately gave effect when the player kicked the ball for Morelos, but Kelly was impressed when he immediately stopped the ball.
But Livingston has succeeded in attracting the guest team to play in the right way, as Lithgow and Halkett continuously unveiled the long lines.
Holt's team had the chance to lead ahead in the final minutes of the match, but unfortunately McGregor chose the right location to stop Jacobs before Lithgow hit the head wide from the corner.
The new player to the Glenn Middleton court of the Rangers continued to appeal for a temple penalty after clashing with Jacobs, but was again rejected by Thomson's referee.
Year: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
Drawing a page from the Yearbook "Japanese Sunday": On 30/09/1882, 136 years ago and THE PHYSICAL PHYSICAL FAMILY ... future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, inventing the platform for a device called the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geiger Counter has not only become a pillar of science, but also a pillar of mass culture. For example, the following is a dialogue in the film "Bells of Coronado", published in 1950, with the participation of the scientists added King Rovan:
The man said, "What is this?"
Rogers: “This is the Geiger Counter, which is used to locate radiation minerals, such as uranium.
“When you wear these headphones in, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that are emitted in the minerals.”
Evans: “Yeah, there’s a rumor here!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention of his name remains with time.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Immune System How To Kill Cells That Are Damaged
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system how to ‘kill’ the damaged cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system how to recognize the damaged cells during treatment.
This method involves taking immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the laboratory.
These cells can then “see” the proteins that are common in many cancers and are re-injected into the body.
A type of test vaccine is giving the possible results in different cancer patients.
A woman who was treated with a type of immune system vaccine recognizes the damaged cells and her ovarian cancer cells disappear after more than 18 months.
This method involves taking immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the laboratory, so that these cells can "see" the common type of protein in many cancers, called HER2, then the cells are re-injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our research results show that we are in the hands of a very promising type of vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the development of some types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and rectum cancer, Professor Berzofsky explains.
A similar study method, taking immune cells from the patient’s body and “teaching” them how to target the destruction of cancer cells, has been effective during the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye received a lot of "stone tiles" when he expressed his insane support for TT. Trump, Team MAGA (Make America Great Again) after Saturday Night Live Music (SNL)
It's not all right.
Kanye West received several lapses in the recording room during the SNL Night, following his man talk show. During the performance, he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and confirmed that he would run in 2020.
After performing the third song, Ghost Town, still wearing the Make America Great Again hat, he is furiously opposed to the Democratic Party and affirms his support for TT. Trump.
“I talked to white friends many times and they said, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s a racialist?’
“If I was worried about racial discrimination, I would have left the United States for a long time,” he said.
The SNL began the show with Matt Damon's involvement. In the episode, the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegations.
Although the show was not aired, the film recorded West’s rage speech was named the comedian Chris Rock posted on social media.
It’s unclear whether Rock deliberately made West a joke when he posted this post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was uncomfortable behind the wings of the chicken just because of his hat.
“They bullied me when I was in the backyard.
They said, ‘Don’t show up with that hat.’
They bullied me!
Then, they say I'm sick," he shared, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you know what a sapphire is?", he asserted that "it will wear the symbolic hat of my hero, because no one can force me to do anything. If you want the world to progress?
“Love me.”
Variety Newspaper reported: His speech caused the crowd to sneeze at least twice, while members of the SNL were confused, one shared: "The whole camera is silent."
West was chosen to replace singer Ariana Grande, as her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West made many wild with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed like a Perrier Bottle.
West received the support of TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner, who once tweeted: "Give one of the most courageous souls: THOSE THINGS THAN YOU."
But TV host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply “acting according to his nature, and this is really great.”
“But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying music products or costumes, or endorsing his ‘art’) because I believe that that person is chasing and propagating bad consciousness to my community.
He has the right to freedom.
“We too,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, officially "named Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, but only to follow Diddy's path, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion; or the music legend Prince, also renamed a symbol and then renamed another artist to Prince.
He is accused of plotting to kill a man in a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with conspiracy after a man was hit in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The indictment will be investigated by the Prosecutor’s Office.
Angry Powers Movie Star Criticizes Maliciousness
Kit Harington is famous for his role as the swordsman Jon Snow in the medieval fictional television series The Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor is quite angry with the hero’s prototype and mentions that such male characters on the screen will make young men feel strong enough to be respected.
Talking to The Sunday Times Culture reporter, Kit said he believed there was “something wrong here” and raised questions about how to solve the toxic male problem of the <0x23>MeToo era.
The newly-married kit plays you in the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, 31. He admits to himself feeling 'pretty necessary' to solve this problem.
“At this point, I personally feel like I don’t know what we’ve done wrong with what’s called masculinity?”
‘What have we taught men when they are grown up about the problems that are present in front of our eyes?’
Kit believes that television may also be partly responsible for the increasing toxicity of the highly masculine characters they are building.
He went on to say, ‘What are the characteristics of birth and what are the characteristics of education?
What is taught on TV and off the road that makes boys feel like they should be male models?
I think this is really a problem of this era – how do we change this?
'Cause obviously there's been something unreasonable with our young men.'
During the interview, he also admitted that he would no longer participate in any narrative or narrative about the Game of Thrones, after the series ends next summer, while affirming that “the battlefield and code are bored.”
Starting in November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard’s True West remake of the story of a filmmaker and brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife, Rose, was the greatest thing when he decided to quit the Game of Thrones.
“I’ve met my wife in this series, which is where my future family and my life start from now on,” he said.
Rose plays the role of Ygritte, the lover of the character Jon Snow whom Kit plays in this fictional Emmy-winning film series.
The couple held the wedding in June 2018, at Leslie's Scottish family's residential campus.
HIV/AIDS: China Reports New Infections Increase by 14%
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14 percent.
Health officials say the country has more than 820.000 people with the disease.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, the number of new infections recorded was 40,000.
The vast majority of new cases of infection are caused by sexually transmitted infections. This is a major change compared to the previous one.
Previously, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China is due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV along this route has dropped to almost zero. This is a statement by Chinese health officials at a conference in Nanjing province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China annually has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem that is occurring in the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality has not been considered illegal in China since 1997, in fact, discrimination against the LGBT community is still very common.
Because of the country’s traditional conservative values, the study estimates that 70-90% of men still marry, despite having had sex with men.
Many people are infected with the disease of the century because they do not use full protection during same-sex intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to providing HIV treatments to all infected patients to deal with the disease.
Maxine Waters denies her employee’s disclosure of Republican senators’ data, stressing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy.”
On Saturday, U.S. Democratic Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information from three Republican senators on Wikipedia about lawmakers.
The Democratic Party in Los Angeles claimed that these complaints were made by “right-wing” experts and organized websites.
"Lies, lies, and even more detestable lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
The leaks include the private address and telephone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, from Utah.
This information began to appear on the network on Thursday, by an anonymous person in the Capitol Hill House during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against candidates for the post of Supreme Court Judge Kaugh Brett.
This information was revealed shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill newspaper wrote: Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifies the source of the posts related to Mrs. Waters' office and reveals information about one of Mrs. Waters' employees.
Mrs. Waters continued, “This unsubstantiated allegation is absolutely untrue and absolutely a lie.”
“The staff in my office has been infringed on identity, personal information and security by these false and misleading allegations that no one has disclosed that information.
This unsubstantiated allegation is totally untrue and is absolutely a lie.”
This statement by Mrs. Waters immediately attracted criticism on the internet, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This statement of rejection expresses anger,” Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she has no gas to become a Congressional Commissioner.
When someone is accused of something they don’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
They are not to be challenged.
They were not allowed to question the motive of the defendant.
They have to show calmness and alertness.”
Fleischer seems to be comparing Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh's reaction to Democratic criticism and critics also accuse him of being too angry in Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is contesting Waters' position in the midterm election, also expressed views on Twitter.
“Big if true,” he wrote on Twitter.
Mrs. Waters said her office had warned "the authorities and law enforcement agencies of these misdemeanors.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are given light," she continued, "and they will be held responsible for all actions that may cause harm and danger to any of my employees."
Review Johnny English Re-emerging Lake - Rowan Atkinson's Funny Spider
Now, you can notice a fairly traditional trend in any new film that has the UK factor is the search for the meaning of Brexit. And the next episode of the series of comedy-acting movies about spy Johnny English is also no exception - the fifth episode of Johnny English, and the second episode of John English.
Will self-made jokes on how useless we are to become a new export opportunity for this country?
Either way, Johnny English’s limited ability with round eyes and flexible face is allowed to explode all over again – his name simply represents a comic book designed for areas that don’t speak.
Of course, he is a secretly active spy, although he always whispered in a strange way in the style of Detective Clouseau, mixing with Mr. Bean's humor and a little bit of an Olympic contribution to the 2012 London Chariots of Fire theme.
The character's model also relies on the international traveler and mysterious man that Atkinson had once closed in Barclaycard's television ad that has now plunged into oblivion and caused chaos when he woke up.
There are some pretty interesting scenes in the latest Johnny English episode.
I like watching Johnny English approach the helicopter while wearing a medieval armored suit and the wings hitting his hat.
Although Atkinson’s humor is fully reflected, the humorous element here seems to be insufficiently heavy and a bit superfluous, especially when movie brands such as “serious” series 007 and “Missing Unbelievable.”
The humorous element in this film can only make children laugh, I myself think that Johnny English’s stupid mistakes are not as creative and noticeable as the jokes in Atkinson’s Mr. Bean.
The situation leading the story is that the UK is in serious trouble.
The hacker has infiltrated the UK’s supersecret spy network, revealing the identity of all British spies operating outside, leading to the loss of a spy on mission, a very unfortunate little role played by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last risky choice of the prime minister, a proud and powerful character, currently facing this proud political crisis: Emma Thompson has shown very well the character of this version of Prime Minister Teresa May, but according to the script she has not much.
Intelligence advisers reported that the body of all active spies had been revealed and she would have to mobilize an unarmed spy.
And that's Johnny English who's disgusted about, currently teaching in a rural area, but is actually teaching lessons outside of the program to become a secret spy: here are some pretty interesting jokes, because English teaches students to spy in the style of the Rock Academy.
English was brought back to the Whitehall Court of Emergency meetings and merged with former unfortunate assistant Bough, played by actor Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, overjoyed a charming submarine commander. Vicki Pepperdine takes on the role of a little wasted talent.
So the Batman and Robin duo specialize in trouble with the Queen's Order back on mission and meet Olga Kurylenko in the role of the beautiful spy woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into a dangerous state under the curse of a charming tech billionaire after he claims to be able to solve all of Britain's computer headaches: Jason Volta's dangerous, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an adventure with extravagant adventures: after drowning into a desk, they burn a French restaurant in the blink of an eye; causing chaos on Volta's luxurious boat; and English is more confusing than ever.
At the end of the film, the buttons will certainly be removed, but such a boiling will be quite similar to television channels for children.
A fairly common work.
And like other Johnny English films, I can’t help but ask the question: can’t the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a fair role, worthy of his talent?
Labour Party rejects information under construction plans to allow British people to work for four days but receive a five-day salary
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider an advanced plan, allowing British people to work four days a week but receive five days a week wages.
According to the information received, the party wanted the business owner to transfer the savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them an extra day of rest.
This means that employees are given a three-day weekend break but still receive the same salary as before.
Sources said the idea “fits” for the party’s economic agenda and is expected to increase support for the country’s workers.
The British Confederation Congress has confirmed that moving to work four days a week is a way for workers to enjoy the benefits of the changing economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: 'The review process of policies is expected to be published by the end of this year.
“This goal can’t be achieved in a short time, but working four days a week is a good aspiration for the party’s leaders in rebalancing the economic balance that benefits the workers as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to embrace this idea. The Green Party of England is committed to working four days/week in the 2017 election campaign.
However, this idea has not yet been passed by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘The four-day week work policy is not the policy of the party and the party is not currently considering this policy.’
Dark Prime Minister John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to boost vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “anonymous directors” and “interested boys” at utility companies.
These plans of the dark prime minister also mean that current shareholders in water-level companies may not be able to regain their full shares because the Labour government can apply ‘deductions’ based on behavior deemed wrong.
He also confirmed plans for employees to join the company’s board of directors and set up a comprehensive ownership fund to give 10% of the private company’s share capital to the company’s employees, from which they are likely to receive annual shares of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy shares in the 60 Minutes show about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh led them to change their decision.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote to nominate him as Supreme Court Judge for at least a week and has questioned whether the results of the Supreme Court's inquiry have been confounded.
In a broadcast interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI found any evidence that could make these senators change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his counterparts from South Carolina.
“I guess of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said in a nude hearing, I had an exchange with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, i.e. after the charge was made and asked, "Did you do that?"
He answered very firmly, decisively and decisively.”
However, Graham’s vote seemed to be completely certain.
He said: “I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh and there’s only one accusation with a new explosive force that has made me change.”
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denies very strongly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all the people she told her name couldn’t confirm the story.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizens' Day and what contributes to the eradication of poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the World Citizens’ Day, an annual music event with the participation of an impressive star to carry out a mission that is not unparalleled: ending poverty.
During the seventh year of the event, the World Citizens’ Festival will see tens of thousands of people pouring into the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to promote awareness.
The Global Citizens’ Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Reduction Project, an international campaign group in the hopes of ending poverty by increasing the number of people who are active in the fight against poverty.
To receive tickets free of charge for this event (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), night music attendees must complete a variety of tasks or “act” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader to accept the invitation, calling or in any other form.
But how has this Global Citizens’ Festival achieved its success, with only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
The idea of a free night of music for people is a practical way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another form of “keyboard movement” – people feel they’re making a real difference on Twitter?
Since 2011, the World Citizens’ Organization has said there are over 10 million “activists” from registered supporters, promoting a range of different targets.
They said these actions have helped encourage leaders around the world to make commitments and policies equivalent to the more than <0x24>37 billion set up to implement intervention measures to improve the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements coming from the group’s actions, with at least <0x24>10 billion being disbursed or funded.
To date, the group estimates that the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partner organization that includes investors and performers, committed to “helping children make the most of their potential,” promising to provide Twitter with more than <0x24>25 million from Rwanda to help put an end to the crisis.
“With the support of the UK government, sponsors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice leading to malnutrition into a milestone in history,” Ambassador Sánchez Dinh said at the London Fourth Anniversary 2018.
The group also said, after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called the Nutrition Force, which ensures nutrition intervention for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the frequently asked questions on the group’s website “what makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizens Group responded, “This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail.
But just like civil rights and anti-racist movements before, we will succeed because together we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will participate in this year’s event in New York, led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy to "restrict" Russia's energy exports - Interior Minister
The Washington Examiner quoted U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke as saying that Washington could mobilize naval forces “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy sources from entering the market, including the Middle East market.
Zinke alleged that Russia’s involvement in Syria — more notable than at the invitation of the legitimate government — was just an excuse to explore new energy markets.
According to the report, he said: “I believe that the reason they invaded the Middle East is because they want to sell energy like in Eastern Europe, the southernmost part of Europe.”
And according to the official news, there are many ways and measures to stop this.
He said: “The United States is capable of using the Navy to ensure that the shipping routes are still open and will be closed, if necessary, to ensure that their energy sources are not brought into the market.”
Zinke called on participants to attend the event organized by the Energy Consumption Union, a self-proclaimed nonprofit group that is “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington’s way of doing things to Russia and Iran, while noting that the two ways of doing things are equally effective.
“The economic plan that Iran and Russia can choose is to leverage and change fuels,” he said, while calling Russia “one-size-fits-all” with a fossil fuel-only economy.
The statements were made when Trump’s administration was seeking to increase its exports of LNG to Europe, aiming at replacing Russia’s position, a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To achieve this goal, officials of the TT administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of the North Stream 2 "inappropriate" North Stream oil project, which Mr. Trump said was "inappropriate" to Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 oil and gas project, which was built to double its current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington’s sharp opposition to the project simply stems from economic reasons and is an example of unhealthy competition.
“I believe that we have a common view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and consumers must be selected as suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. military has provoked a strong reaction from Germany, which has since reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy, as well as the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I face a big problem when there is a third country trying to interfere in our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, President of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), said after a meeting between German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will “Consider” the 2020 Presidential Election, Massachusetts Senator Says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “seriously consider” the presidential election following the midterm election.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the election.
The Hill newspaper quoted her as saying, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and correct the government’s failures, and so need a woman at the top.”
“After 6/11, I will seriously consider the presidential election.”
Warren criticized President Donald Trump at a meeting in the city hall and said he was "putting the country in the wrong direction."
“I’m really worried about what Donald Trump will do for our democracy,” she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said "of course the FBI must investigate before voting."
However, a poll on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s voters don’t think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Policy Research Center, 58% of Massachusetts' "possible" voters said Senators shouldn't run.
32% voted in favor of the election.
The poll showed that there were more voters in favour of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour and 48% in opposition.
Other potential Democratic candidates are named when referring to the 2020 presidential election, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin Leads to Track Palin’s Post-Stroke Stress Disorder (PTSD) Syndrome at Donald Trump’s Campaign
Track Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what I’m going through when he returns, I can imagine that other families will also suffer the consequences of PTSD syndrome and the injuries our soldiers bring when he returns,” she told the crowd at the Trump campaign in Tullah.
Palin called the arrest of his son "a clear issue but no one wants to mention" and said that her son and other former warriors returned after the war "there was a change, a more extreme, and a question of whether there was any respect for them and their troops, the aerial and any other military."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, preventing others from reporting domestic violence and possession of weapons during the war.
18 states and D.C. support the new refugee policy challenge
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting the new U.S. policy challenge of refusing refugees for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and D.C. sent a short collective text Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers against the policy.
They are full names of the petitions in the Grace and Sessions lawsuits filed by the U.S. Liberty League in August to oppose federal policy have not yet been disclosed.
She said her lover "and the son of his violent gang members" had abused her but U.S. officials refused to apply for her asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors from the Grace-backed states describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the United States when countries face gang issues and domestic violence quite common.
The new U.S. refugee policy reverses the 2014 decision by the Council of Immigrant Refugees to allow immigrants without a passport to flee domestic violence to seek refuge.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "neglects the state, federal and international legal system for decades."
“The federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered based on the specific events and circumstances of the applicant, and this obstruction policy violates that principle,” the summary text presents.
Prosecutors also argued in the short text that the policy of refusing immigration is damaging the U.S. economy, because immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "completely supplying the necessary labour resources."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions called on the jury to request that immigration not continue to allow refugees to flee from the gang’s domestic violence and abuses in June.
“Only allow refugees to leave their country because of oppression or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social or political group,” Sessions said in a statement.
Refugees are never a means to minimize all of the problems – even all of the serious ones – that people face on a daily basis around the world.
The desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubled in the search for survivors.
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It's really very stressful," Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, shared while applauding her son who was suffering from fever at a refugee center in the desperate city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance carries more people in.
“Clean water is very rare.”
People returning to their homes were destroyed, picking up the stuff that was plunged into the water, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were completely overloaded, after being damaged by the 7.5-degree Richter earthquake.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, were fractured and his shoulders rested outside the Palu Military Hospital. Here the patient was treated outdoors due to severe resuscitation continues.
His tears evoked as he recalled the intense earthquake that moved the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We don’t even have enough time to save ourselves.
I think I've been shot down by the wall," Haris told the Associated Press and added that his family had come to town to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry and cry, but then I can’t hear anything.
I don’t know what happened to my wife.
I hope they’re all safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'smoking' with 'advertising'
A week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page ad on a U.S. newspaper referring to the common interests of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to propagate.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to an additional sum from China Daily for the Des Moines Register - the state's best-selling newspaper - after China's accusation of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. parliamentary election. China rejected this claim.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marks a new phase in a push-up campaign with Washington’s China following what U.S. officials share with Reuters.
Although foreign governments are putting commercial promotional advertising on the market is absolutely normal, Beijing and Washington are now trapped in a escalating trade war, with evidence that they have imposed high tariffs on both sides’ imports.
China and U.S. experts say China's tariff policy to retaliate in the early stages of the trade war has been designed to target exporters in the Republican-backed states of the TT. Trump as the state of Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of the state of Iowa, a country that exports large agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote a paragraph in the Des Moines Register newspaper on Sunday, saying that China "continued that bullying by running advertisements broadcast on our own free newspaper."
“In an effort to propagate, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and free press when placing a paid ad on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, in the newspapers on the streets of Beijing, you rarely find disagreements and will not see any genuine reflection on the Chinese’s differing opinions on China’s difficult economic trajectory,” said the media outlet.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers has avoided the proposal" of his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn the Republican Party is making women voters far ahead of the midterm election with Kavanaugh’s case.
When several Republican leaders stood up to defend the candidate for the position of Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh before a few allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that they may have to undergo a harsh, special reaction.
The emotion surrounding the case is quite strong and most Republican candidates on the list of candidates show they want to continue voting.
There are things we can’t do again,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he did not think that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona's) clicked the button to agree to the FBI conduct sufficient investigations to ease angry voters.
The Washington, D.C. newspaper quoted Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the MoveOn Progress Group on Friday as saying, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday - tomorrow they will not forget and by November they will not forget."
Mic reports: On Friday morning, protesters shouted "11am is coming!" as they parade in the lobby of the Senate because the Republican Party is in control of the Justice Committee has chosen to continue to vote for Kavana Blaugh's nomination.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be pushed higher than ever,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news.
“It is said that the motivation has now been very high; it is true.
But it could be even higher, especially among women voters in outskirts and young voters, between 18 and 29 years of age, they often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford publicly sworn in on details of the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court’s candidate, analysts said the public could have a serious reaction if the Republican party continues to confirm it.
NBC News quoted Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as saying last week: “This could become a mess the Republican Party has to deal with.”
“The issue is not only the vote of the committee or the formal vote, whether Kavanaugh becomes a Supreme Court Judge or not, but more important than the way Republicans handle the trial this time, and the way they treat the U.S. prosecutor,” he said.
However, Americans disagree on whether to trust Ford’s or Mr. Kavanaugh’s statements, more people seem to doubt Mr. Kavanaugh.
A new survey by YouGov found that 41% of respondents said they were confident or could believe Ford’s statement, while 35% said they were sure or could believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents thought that Kavanaugh might or certainly had lied when giving the statement, while only 30 percent believed that Ford was certain or could have lied.
After Flake hits the button, the FBI is investigating the allegations of Ford and at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford had sworn before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court's candidate of revealing his sexuality to her when they attended a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start building new Internet to receive Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a start-up project aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend is called Inrupt, a build company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid Open Source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store data and which people are granted the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt project was to “govern the world.”
“We have to start right now,” he said about this startup project.
“Now is the moment of history.”
The application uses Solid technology, allowing users to create their own “no personal data online” or POD.
This data store may include a contact list, a list of things to do, a calendar, a music library, other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all are available on a browser and display simultaneously.
The unique thing about this online personal data warehouse is that users have the full right to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “the acquisition of control over personal data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of the Inrupt project is to ensure the company has the right resources, processes and skills to help deliver Solid to everyone.
The company now has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that has been acquired by IBM, some developers have signed work contracts under the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps themselves with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not there was a complete change because all of their business models could be completely upgraded after a night.
“We don’t need to ask them for permission.”
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that protects the integrity and quality of the newly built Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Association at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been the influential name in the debate on the neutrality of the internet.
Despite launching the Inrupt project, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Association, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Father Bernard Vann received the Victorian Cross Medal in World War I.
The 100th Anniversary of the Unique Church of England was awarded Queen Victoria's Cross Medal in World War I as a warrior who was held in her home country.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he died of a gunshot wound four days later and never knew he had won the British Army's highest honorary medal.
On Saturday, his two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone during the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the two grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a “bright symbol” when the stone was displayed 100 years after the war that helped his grandfather win the medal.
According to the London News, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Vann commanded his battalion to cross through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "four layers of special thick fog, under strong fire from guns and machine guns."
Afterwards, he jumped straight into the gun and with "great empathy," he led the battalion over to the top, before jumping into a gunman and lowering the three spies.
Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “acts that I could never do myself, but there was humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a bouquet of flowers after the Brentwood Royal Youth Parade.
Michael Vann said he felt "very proud to be involved in the parade" and "the courage of a true hero would be noted by the support of many."
Fans of formal wrestling overnight to watch Bellator 206, but eventually they only get Peppa Pig
Imagine you’ve been up all night waiting to watch Bellator 206 with a hard-fought audience, but eventually refused to watch the main event.
The San Jose introductory section said there were 13 matches, including six on the main card and broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as soon as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to play, the audience in the UK was shocked when the screen turned to Peppa Pig.
Some people feel disrespected after they wake up in the morning to watch the match.
A fan posted on Twitter that turning the show into a children’s animated film was like “a ridiculous joke.”
“The government regulates that the content of the video at 6 a.m. is inappropriate, so they have to be turned into children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the program’s transfer.
"Peppa the pig, that's right."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they were considering a broadcasting schedule to ensure that the British audience could watch the show in the future.
Mr. Coker said, "I think if we play it again, we can solve the problem."
“But there’s 6 a.m. on Sunday and we can’t deal with the problem until Sunday in our time zone, but it’s Monday in their time zone.
But we're trying to find a solution.
Believe me, when people change programs, there are a lot of messages back and those messages are not friendly.
We tried to fix it, initially we thought it was due to technical flaws.
But in the end, it’s not the government’s policy.
I can promise you that this won’t happen next time.
We will reduce the number of matches to five, instead of six as originally expected - the number of matches that we usually offer and we have tried to offer beyond the level for the fans.
This is really an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'poor' about sexual tendencies
Olympic jumper Tom Daley shared that as he grew up, he always felt poorly lost people because of his sexual tendencies – but that was his motivation for success.
The 24-year-old shared that he didn’t realize “I’m not like anyone” until he went to school.
Speaking on Desert Island Discs’ No. 4 show led by Lauren Laverne, he said he had voiced the rights of gay men to bring “hope” to others.
He also said being a parent has made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the director of this long-standing rice show, has been taking a few months off to nurture the disease.
Among the first to Laverne, Daley appears as an abandoned person, saying that he feels "poor" to everyone, because "his gender is not socially acceptable as clearly his son and daughter."
“Until today, feelings about the feeling of losing poor and different self remain there, becoming motivation and strength so that I can succeed,” he said.
He wanted to prove that he had "something accomplished" so that people wouldn't be disappointed to know the truth about his sexual tendencies.
The two-time Olympic medalist has become a positive driver for the LGBT community and he uses his images at this year’s Australian Commonwealth Sports Congress to call on more countries to fight against homophobia.
He said he spoke out because he felt very fortunate to be able to live openly without being discriminated against and wanted to bring “hope” to others.
The three-time world champions army shared that he loved a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black. The two met in 2013 and "surprisedly fell in love."
Daley was married to a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age gap was never an obstacle between the two.
“When you had to experience so much suffering as a child” — he first participated in the Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — it would be hard to find someone of the same age as he had experienced a stroke.
The couple became the parents of the boy Robert Ray Black-Daley in June and Daley said that his "visual world" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, my goal was 'I have to win the gold medal'," he said.
“But, you know, there are many things that are more important than the Olympic gold medal.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was about to die and one of the last things he asked was that they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you that 'cha can't sit in the front row anymore'," he said.
“I hold your hand when you last breathe and even when you stop breathing and leave forever, I can’t finally admit that you must be an invincible person.”
A year later, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the medal.
“I just knew that it was the dream of my whole life – dancing in front of the crowd of athletes at the Olympics, it really didn’t feel any better,” he said.
It was also an inspiration for him to choose the first song - Heather Small's Pride - the song that accompanied him during his training towards the Olympics and still excites him every time he hears it.
Desert Island Discs broadcast on BBC's No. 4 at 11:15 BST on Sunday.
Mickelson defiant on the spare seat was knocked out by Ryder on Saturday
American goalkeeper Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to raise the level to avoid this record becoming a sad experience.
Mickelson played in this two-year event once 12 times but captain Jim Furyk left him in reserve seats in the fourball and foursome series on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action as in the U.S., the five-time winner has to spend the whole day actively playing the game in the hope of getting rid of the unpleasant feeling.
The 48-year-old with the school’s headquarters are flat-faced strikes that have never been an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National stadium, even when he’s at the highest level, because the wrong strikes here will have to endure severe consequences.
And if the stadium is not yet occupied enough, Mickelson will still have to compete in the Sunday 9th match against his rival, the Expanded British Championship Army Francesco Molinari. This week, Molinari is paired with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood and the squadron.
If the U.S. team is currently losing 4 points before the start of the 12-match series that wants to start impressively, Mickelson’s game is crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his opponent and did not say too much.
"He understands his role very well today, he slaps my back, puts his arm through my face and says he will be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's very confident.
He is a legend and has contributed a lot to the team, in the past and throughout this week.
I could never have imagined he was playing two games.
I imagined more, but that’s how things happen and we think that’s the way to go.
He wants to play, like all the other teams.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record, becoming the most-match player in the Ryder Cup.
It could also be the mark of the end of his career at the Ryder Cup because the highs in his personal record have never appeared in this match.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and a draw, although Furyk said his presence brought invisible value to the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he likes to laugh at people. He's really funny in the group," he explains.
“I think the young players are also very happy to meet him and this week is a lot of fun.
“What he gives is more than a game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the leading advantage could quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, head of the European team, has had the experience that even though his team took a long lead in the Ryder Cup finals, the results can still be easily reversed in an unpleasant way.
The Dane started the match in 1997 at Valderrama, where their team, led by Seve Ballesteros, led five points ahead of the American team but ultimately won the match with a ratio of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You always have to remind yourself that we’ve led a lot in Valderrama; we’ve led a lot in Brookline and we’ve lost a lot in Valderrama, we’ve won, but we’ve got a lot of stuff,” Bjorn said, with the appearance on the front imagining after watching the game of the Class of 2018.
So history will tell me and everyone in the team that it’s not over yet.
You still have to focus on tomorrow.
Going to the field and playing very well.
The game doesn’t end when the score isn’t on the table.
Our goal is to win the Cup this year and that’s our focus.
I’ve always said that you’re focused on my 12 players, but we also understand the strength of your team – they’re the best players in the world.”
Glad about the performance of his supporters on the bent court, Bjorn added: "I'll never say anything before.
Tomorrow will be another war.
Tomorrow will be the show of each individual and it will certainly be very different.
It would be great if you played in pairs and everything went well. But when you play individually, all of a player's abilities will be revealed.
That’s the message you have to share with all the players, that they have to be ready for the best match tomorrow.
Now a couple of matches have to be separated and each one has to be ready for the best match.”
Unlike Bjorn, the team’s captain, Jim Furyk expects his opponents to show their personal abilities better than playing in pairs, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself had been in both directions in the big strides on the last day, had been a member of the winning team at Brookline before failing while the European team was cited as "The Miracle in Medinah."
"I remember one word," he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the team's captain in 1999, gathered and encouraged the players before the final day of the game.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’ll want to start quickly as you see in Brookline, or as you see in Medinah.
When the results are following a trend, the matches in the middle will be under a lot of pressure.
“We’re building the team that way and sending the champions out on the pitch according to the strategy and trying to make things happen tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned to lead the team and face Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other European players in the first series.
"I chose this team, in that order because I believe it's a way to get through," Bjorn said of the choice for his singles match.
Germany’s new warships have been postponed.
The German Navy’s latest axle was supposed to have run in 2014 to replace the former Cold War warship, but at least by the next year it could run due to system failures and increased costs.
The Die Zeit newspaper quoted an army spokesman as saying that the Rheinland-Pfalz test operation, the flagship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg axle, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the aftermath of the shipment hampered the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-type ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the former Bremen-type axle ship.
This means that these ships will be equipped with a powerful firearm, a range of aerial and anti-ship missiles, some mysterious technologies, such as radar trace reduction, infrared and sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – which can deploy the latest axle ships in remote national ports for up to two years.
However, the continuous delay meant that these modern warships — supposedly helping Germany control overseas countries — would become reluctant at the time of start-up, The Zeit Journal noted.
Unfortunately, the F125 was reported last year when the German Navy officially refused to test the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
There is little information on the reason behind the ship’s return, but German media mentions a serious “software and hardware surplus” that would result in the warship being completely useless if it participated in a combat mission.
The software failure was particularly serious because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-type ship would be caused by a fleet of 120 operating sailors - with only half of the crew on the former Bremen-type axle ship.
At the same time, it can be seen that the weight of the ship increased significantly, leading to a decrease in performance and limiting the future upgrade capability of the Navy.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate ship is thought to be twice as heavy as the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – is also a serious issue.
The project is said to have raised substantial capital to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) - while the initial estimated cost was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problem of moving the newest axle vessels became particularly important, in the recent context of warnings about the German naval power being increasingly narrowed.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, recognized the Navy as "lacking a warship capable of participating."
The official said the problem was becoming more and more serious over time, because the old ship had stopped operating but there was no replacement ship.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships were eligible to join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of the dwarf.
A new study is underway in a land area in Scotland’s Highlands to reveal how wildlife uses natural landscapes to hunt for food.
Hopefully, these findings will shed light on the behavior of this uniquely flying mammal and orient conservation activities in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, tracked the voyages of common dwarfs, soprano pipistrelles, brown eardrums, and Daubenton dwarfs in the Inverewe Garden Area in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important locations around the study ground area to track the activity of these species throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with handheld detectors.
The sound analyst will perform an analysis of all the recordings and determine the sound frequency of the species and the purpose of the sound pronunciation of each particular specimen.
Subsequently, maps and reports of the habitat of the species will be set up to have a detailed picture of the natural landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s nature conservation adviser, hopes the results will help determine which habitats play the most important role in the species and how they ever live in the environment.
This information will help determine the benefits of the habitat management activities of the organism, such as grassland cultivation and the best way to preserve the forests for the dams and other related species.
Populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and developmental activities that affect the swamps and lose their habitat.
Wind turbine and lighting systems, fly trap paper, some chemical treatment methods for building materials, as well as pet cat attacks can also pose a risk to the species.
It's not completely blind.
However, due to the habit of hunting at night, ears are more useful than eyes when squirming and catching.
They use an extremely sophisticated wine-locating technique to identify obstacles on the flight path.
NTS is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land nationwide, while at the same time paying special attention to the species.
The organization has ten trained professionals who regularly conduct surveys, inspect and sometimes participate in the rescue of animals.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only shark reserve in the Threave area in Dumfries and Galloway. It is home to eight of Scotland's ten sharks.
The land manager, David Thompson, said the land was their ideal territory.
"Threave is a very good habitat for bugs," he said.
“We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of trees and a good living environment.
But there’s still a lot of mystery about dungeons, so work here and in other facilities will help us understand more about what dungeons need to grow further.”
He stressed the importance of having to check the life of the dwarf before preserving in the land, because accidentally destroying their fertile beetles could kill up to 400 infants and vomiting, almost completely destroying the masses.
Cows are protected species and killing, disturbing, disturbing or destroying their beetles is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an employee of the Scottish Survival Fund, has encouraged the community to help.
“We still need to learn more about the species and with many species, we can’t know how far away they are from each other,” she said.
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and his lawyer prepares German magazine lawsuit
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations of sex against him were “fake faith” and that there were people “who want to benefit” by his age name.
His lawyer is preparing a lawsuit for the German newspaper Der Spiegel for announcing the indictment.
The Portuguese champion who is currently playing for the Juventus team has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
The newspaper Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the player allegedly paid the woman <0x24>375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
In a live video on Instagram in front of 142 million followers hours after the allegations were announced, 33-year-old Ronaldo said the report was “fake news.”
"No, no, no.
What they say today is fake news," the five-time player won the Golden Ball in front of the camera.
“They want to use my age name to benefit.
That's normal, too.
Saying my name they are famous, but that’s only part of the job.
I'm a happy person and everything's fine," the player added and smiled.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a Japanese report Der Spiegel on the allegation, which they call “an unacceptable suspicion of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would be demanding compensation for "the moral damages corresponding to the severity of the violation, which may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The indictment allegedly occurred in June 2009 at a high-end resort at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are believed to have returned to the player's room. According to a record at the Clark County Court, Nevada, he was accused of raping her at the hotel.
Mayorga said Ronaldo was down after the charge and said he was “99 percent” “good” and only “1 percent” was not good.
There is evidence that Ronaldo confirmed the two sides had sex, but based on consensus.
Mayorga also said she had been taken to the police station and wounded at the hospital, but later agreed to reconcile out of court because she was "fearing revenge" and worried about "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old woman said she was now looking to reverse the previous reconciliation decision because she continued to be beaten by the incident in the allegations.
At the time of the indictment, Ronaldo was preparing for a transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but at the end of the summer he moved to play for the Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million transfer deal.
Brexit: UK 'will be forever sorry' for losing automaker status
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" if it lost its world-leading position in post-Brexit car production.
He also added that it was “preoccupied” when Toyota UK shared with the BBC that if it left the European Union without any further deal, it would stop production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which houses Toyota’s Auris and Avensis lines, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries within the European Union.
“My point is that if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will have to stop production at this factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK are also concerned about the UK leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said it would close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risk of a supply chain in case of Brexit without any other deal.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “just-in-time” principle, with spare parts supplied by suppliers in the UK and the European Union delivering every 37 minutes for the production lines on order.
If you leave the EU without any other agreement on March 29, there is a possibility of a break at the border and this concern could lead to delays and a lack of spare parts.
Toyota said the company could not keep stock value for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so they would have to stop production.
Clark said Prime Minister Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the European Union would be "precisely adjusted to avoid checks at the border."
"We need a deal. We want the best deal, not only to ensure success in the present, but also to ensure that we take this opportunity very well," he said in BBC's Today show No. 4.
“Evidence from Toyota as well as other car manufacturers suggests we need to ensure that the supply chain continues to be successful.”
Toyota has not yet announced for how long it will definitely stop production, but in the long run, they warn that additional costs will reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually, workers will lose their jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a millionaire at the Unite factory, saying his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience once I lose these jobs, there will never be again.
A government spokesman said: "We have constructed an accurate and reliable plan for future relations with the European Union."
White House announces meeting between TT. Trump and Rosenstein may be postponed again
The White House announced on Sunday that TT’s senior meeting with Deputy Advocate General Rod Rosenstein could be “backwards for another week” as the fight over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian election, links between TT’s aides. Trump and Russia and the possibility of the president obstructing the enforcement of justice.
Trump’s dismissal of the deputy general ideal, which would mean that Mueller would be difficult to operate independently, has raised many Washington rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported Rosenstein had discussed wearing headphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through Court No. 25.
Rosenstein refused to report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to resign.
Instead, his meeting with President Trump, who was attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "doesn't want" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee's bare trial between Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of extortion.
On Friday, President Trump asked the FBI to spend a week investigating the allegations against Kavanaugh, while continuing to postpone the Senate’s full vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "The unscheduled day of the meeting, perhaps this week, might see the reason for this delay is because other issues are taking place in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll get the news soon and the press will be updated.”
Some reporters may disagree with the statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The host of the show, Chris Wallace, asked her about this.
Sanders said the absence of press meetings was not due to the dislike of television reporters "too many things", although she had once said, "I also agree that journalists are actually a lot of things."
She then suggested that there should be more direct contact between President Trump and the press.
“The president is currently asking more questions than any previous president,” she added without giving any evidence: “We’ve reviewed the number of press meetings.”
Sanders said there would still be press conferences, but “if the press had the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States, that would be much better than talking to me.
“We’ve tried a lot and you’ve seen us do a lot in the last few weeks, which will replace a press conference when you can talk directly to the US president.”
President Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or during press conferences when officials come to visit.
Press briefings are usually very rare.
This week, in New York, the president should have stated the reason, but he suddenly appeared with a strange set in front of the crowd of reporters.
The Minister of Health writes letters to European Union employees working in the healthcare sector in Scotland to talk about Brexit fears
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to European Union workers working in the healthcare sector in Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and wishes for workers to remain behind Brexit.
Health Minister Jeane Freeman has sent a letter with a message to resign within six months of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish government is committed to supporting the costs of applications for residence certificates of EU citizens working in the public services sector that have been transferred.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "Throughout this summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union are still ongoing, the decision is expected to be made this fall.
But the UK government is also pushing hard work to prepare for a scenario that may not reach an agreement.
I know that this is an unpleasant time with all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate that I now appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
What’s more, colleagues from the European Union have brought valuable experience and skills to help strengthen and improve healthcare services, while benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we look forward to staying with you.”
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injury.
Tennessee state Tigers' side Christoon Abercrombie had an emergency surge after head injury in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ in Tennessee reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break-up.
"He ran to the side of the border and crashed down," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the perimeter just before putting him on the can and taking him to a further check.
An official from Tennessee told Chris Harris at the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added "no detailed information on the extent/type of the injury" and the state of Tennessee is trying to figure out the time of the injury.
Abercrombie, a second-year student of the red shirt team, first competed under the Tennessee state shirt after relocating from Illinois.
He had a total of five games on Saturday before being eliminated from the game and he had a total of 18 games this season.
Foreigners buying real estate in the UK will be taxed higher
Foreigners buying real estate in the UK will be taxed higher, this additional increase will be used to help homeless people under Tory’s new policies.
This change will disable the success of Corbyn’s young voters.
The tax increase will apply to those who do not file a tax in the UK.
The finance ministry is expected to help raise this policy to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help homeless people.
Foreigners buying real estate in the UK will be taxed higher – this additional increase will be used to help homeless people, Prime Minister Theresa May will announce today.
This change will discourage successful efforts to attract Jeremy Corbyn’s young voters with a commitment to providing cheaper housing and targeting high-income individuals.
The tax increase will apply to non-tax individuals and businesses in the UK, which will boost the government’s efforts to counteract the current state of detention.
The fee – in addition to the current tax rate, which includes higher taxes that were announced two years ago for the second house and the houses purchased just for that – could be up to three percent.
The finance ministry expects this change to increase to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of newly built properties in London have been sold to non-U.K. citizens, which has pushed home prices up and made home buyers increasingly difficult for the first time.
Many of the country's wealthy areas - especially in the capital - have become "spirit cities" because most foreigners buy homes most of their time in other countries.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to help many young people have a chance to own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by taking land but not using it, urging Prime Minister May to give up the deadline for affordable homes to remedy the "residential disaster" in the UK.
Corbyn also announced a series of housing reforms aimed at attracting voters, including controlling rents and ending "no faults" deportations.
He also wanted to give councils more power to build a new house.
May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring my dreams – that life would be better for the next generation.
And that means having to re-regulate the housing market is very chaotic now.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build life here.
However, this does not mean that non-UK residents and overseas companies can easily buy homes like hard-working UK residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a house has become too far away and the delay is still huge.”
Jack Ross: "My last hope is to lead Scotland's team"
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, said his "last hope" was to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
Scot, 42, is facing the Northeast club’s revival challenge, currently holding third place in League One, three points less than first place.
He moved to the Lights Stadium this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to play for my country as a player.
I had a hat with the B logo and that's what I wanted," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“My five-month childhood was linked to the Scottish games that took place in Hampden with my father, and that’s always what reminds me.
However, that opportunity will come only if I succeed in managing the club.”
Sunderland's predecessors before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach said he did not feel pressured to succeed the seniors at such a big club, which he had previously rejected from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me right now will be judged by 'Can I bring the club back to the Premier League?'
"The organizational structure and the material facilities at this club are definitely part of the Premier League championship," he said.
"This is not a task to achieve easily, but I only consider myself to be a success if I can bring the club back to the tournament."
Ross had three years as a manager, after a time as a manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa restore his position after falling to third place, and took St Mirren from the risk of falling into championships the following season.
Ross said he now feels very comfortable throughout his football career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That's probably a real step forward," he recalled in the lead role of Alloa.
“I really believe that I’m more in line with a managerial role than a player.
This sounds strange because I’ve been quite successful, had good income and achieved certain achievements when I was a player.
But the game is usually not easy.
There are a lot of things you have to face every week.
I still have to endure the stress and pressure of the job but I’m happy with the management job.
I’ve always wanted to do the management job and now I’m doing it, I feel most comfortable being myself throughout my adult life.”

The survey shows that the ideal time to enjoy a glass of beer is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The hot summer sunrise has increased revenues for the UK’s struggling wineries but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to figures, wineries and bars saw revenues rise 2.7% in July – but revenues at restaurants fell 4.8%.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s consulting firm, summarized the figures, saying: “The long-term sun and the UK team into the World Cup set the July sales trend similar to that of June, when the winery rose 2.8%, the restaurants were more affected.
Revenue in restaurants fell 1.8% in June and worsened in July.
The fastest-growing drinks and bars are the fastest-growing compared to the drop in restaurants.
Food-supervised restaurants are also affected by the heat of the sun, although not as severe as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go drink.
Sales of beverages at managed bars and bars increased 6.6% in the month while sales of food fell 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s entertainment and hotel analyst, said: “These results show the trend we’ve been seeing since the end of April.
The weather and impact of large social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to revenue at restaurants.
Not surprisingly, as restaurants continue to struggle, revenues fell 4.8% compared to the same period last year while cost pressures continued to rise.
The prolonged hot summer has taken place right at the worst time for food suppliers, not knowing in August when the colder weather could improve the current situation.
Total revenue growth in wineries and restaurants, including new venues, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a stagnation in brand deployment.
The sales monitoring of the Coffer Peach Tracker for wineries, bars and restaurants in the UK has collected and analyzed data on work efficiency from 47 active groups, with combined revenues of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and that is the industry’s benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that their parents don’t know.
One in five children - some at the age of 11 - have secret social media accounts that parents and teachers don't know, the survey found.
The results of a survey of 20,000 second-grade students showed that the number of “virtual Insta” pages has increased significantly.
The news has raised concerns about the increase in online pornography content.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “correct” account to show their parents
One-fifth of children – some 11-year-olds – are creating social media accounts that they keep secret with adults.
A survey of 20,000 second-grade students revealed rapid growth in “Insta fake” accounts – a reference to Instagram photo sharing page.
The news has heightened concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said children use a “master” account that doesn’t have bad content for parents to view, and they also have their own account.
A mother accidentally finds the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, and finds a teenage boy calling on someone else to “violete me.”
According to a study by the UK’s Advanced Recognition Board of Directors (HMC) and the UK’s Directors’ Conference in public schools, 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admit they have their own accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It is troubling that many teens are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers cannot find.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "representative of athletes" at the Scottish Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Supervisory Board as the non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most prestigious medalist, and President Ian Beattie considers this change a great opportunity for sports coaches to use her rich competing experience on international stages over the past decade.
"Eilidh is very respected in the full-fledged community of Scotland, the UK and around the world, we are sure that full-fledged in Scotland will benefit greatly when she is elected to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to play as a representative of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead this sport in Scotland."
An American who had once won the gold medal in 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, he had all four Olympic gold medals and is now a permanent commentator for the BBC, who was unable to travel after experiencing a devastating earthquake.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I can't go.
The doctors said that there was only time for me to say whether I was recovering or in what condition.
It was a tired road but to fully recover, re-learn how to walk and now I was able to travel smoothly!
Thank you for your inspiring messages!”
Advertising dairy suction machine compares mothers with cow milk that divides comments online
A company that specializes in dairy suckers splits over the internet with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows.
To mark the launch of the product, which is considered to be "the world's first wearable and non-smoking milk-smoker", consumer technology company Elvie has launched an advertisement inspired by a music video that is inspiring to showcase its self-esteem.
The four mothers danced in a dry-grassed cake with a song that reads: "Yes, I've got my own milk, but you don't see any tails and "In case you don't realize, this isn't a nipple, they're my breasts."
The song goes on to say, "Shoot milk out, suck milk out, I'm feeding the kids, suck milk out, suck milk out, I'm sucking milk for my girls."
However, this ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a lot of controversy on the internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received many left-handed responses from the audience, with many comments claiming that the ad is lightening the "horror" of the dairy industry.
“It’s a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except for the cows that are stolen from the mother cows within a few days after birth.
Elvie Milk Suction Machine Closed Inside Breast Suction (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “This can cause psychological damage to both the mother and the baby.
Yes, why not use it to advertise dairy suction machines for breastfeeding mothers?”
Another commenter added: "This announcement has nothing to do with it."
There were people who also protected the ads, a woman admitting that she saw the song "very funny".
“I think this is a unique idea.
I would buy one if I still breastfeed.
Sucking milk really makes me feel like a cow.
This ad is a bit crazy, but I understand its message.
This is a unique product,” another commented.
Another commented: "This is an interesting ad targeting mothers who need milk (usually at work or in the toilet) and they feel like "cows".
This is not a complimentary advertisement or a review of the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they had danced with a milk suction machine hidden in their lingerie.
The idea behind this operation is based on the fact that many women suck milk to let their breastfeeding infants say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk vacuum cleaner does not cause noise, has no wires or tubes and is tightly closed inside the breasts for the baby, helping women to move freely, breastfeed and even go outside while sucking milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “Elvie’s milk sucker is truly a revolutionary product, deserves a bold introduction and encourages curiosity.
When comparing women with dairy cows, we want people to know about the dairy products and the related challenges, while expressing fun and empathetic about the freedom that new dairy products bring to mothers.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s milk suction machine has appeared on newspaper headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the floor of the catwalk by designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children immigrated quietly to a tent on the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children detained has grown steadily, although the number of people over the monthly threshold has remained virtually unchanged, partly because the harsh arguments and policies put forward by the Trump administration have made the process of bringing children to donors more difficult.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors have been immigrants without papers, and they worry that getting an immigrant child could affect the chances of staying in their own United States.
The risk increased in June, when federal governments announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their family would have to take their fingerprints, and this data would be shared with the immigration agency.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Authority, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of applicants for funding for juveniles without guardians.
The agency then confirmed that 70% of those arrested had never received a fine.
“Almost 80 percent of sponsors or family members are here illegally, and most of them have been fined.
So we're continuing to judge these individuals," Albence said.
According to employees working in refugee camps, in order to be able to deal quickly with cases involving these children, officials have introduced new regulations requiring several sponsors to appear in the building within a month of detention, instead of after 60 days, as per the previous standard.
Many people will appear through videoconferencing, rather than being directly present, to rectify their legal status before an immigrant judge.
Those who are deemed not eligible to be supported will be expelled quickly.
The longer detained children are, the more they become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent acts or attempts to escape, according to staff at refugee camps and reports from the system in recent months.
Proponents said the anxiety is increasing at a larger facility like Tornillo, where they see a child experiencing difficulties more likely to be overlooked due to the size of the camp.
They added that bringing children to the city of refugee camps without having enough time to prepare spiritually or say goodbye to friends could cause psychological damage that many children are suffering.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish ‘occupied forces’ to withdraw from the country immediately
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to the country, although the civil war had entered into the eighth year.
Moualem, the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces had been illegally in Syria, under the name of anti-terrorism forces, so "will be dealt with".
“They have to withdraw from Syria unconditionally and immediately,” he said.
Moualem stressed that “the war on terrorism in Syria is nearing its end,” now more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions leaving their warm home.
He said Damascus would continue “to fight in this holy war until we expel terrorist groups from the entire territory of Syria” and “the illegal presence of foreign forces.”
The U.S. currently has about 2,000 troops in Syria, specializing in training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the country undergoing a devastating war.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem said the country's previous conditions were good enough for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "turning out unreasonable fears" that led to refugees not returning.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of refugees," he said.
“They’re using the military for humanitarian matters.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a neutral zone in the last insurgency of Idlib has created an opportunity to foster political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces by Russia’s post-war forces on the province, where there are three million people living.
However, Moualem stressed that the deal had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military action would target the holy elements of the war, including the fighters from the Nusra Front affiliated with al-Qaeda, would be "deleted".
UN Special Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committee, including the government and opposition members, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the committee's work was limited to "examining the provisions of the current constitution" and warning not to interfere in the elections.
Why Trump Will Win in Second Terms
Logically, President Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless the criminal process and the controversy end the president’s term prematurely, as liberals hope.
This is obviously the “most tragic day of a presidential term!”
So far, there are no signs of declining heat.
Since 2014, the percentage of viewers in the golden hour has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News now has 2.4 million viewers at the golden hour, compared to 1.7 million viewers from four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has been at the top of the cable television rankings with more than 3.5 million viewers on the main news item.
"Although I don't understand it, many people are still attracted to the book as firefighters," said Neal Baer, ABC's executive of the television show Designated Survivor, about a secretary-general becoming president after an attack that destroyed the House of Representatives.
Nell Scovell, a former comedian and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: and the book "Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another hypothesis.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Trump.
You asked why, why?
"He said, 'Because he made me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell said to me.
This is an interesting thing in the context of chaos.
Of course, unlike what’s happening on TV, any Washington move can also determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or the convergence of immigration families and the global economic situation.
Only a few new TV viewers have the privilege of choosing their own channels.
Not only that, this is even more appealing to the news when you get six hours to see a group of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward’s “deep source” of information in his book “Fear,” or Paul’s Washington coat of armor, which is worth <0x24>15,000.
I changed my mind about Super Mario.
"One of the things he does is always bring you something new every night that makes it look like a real-life television show," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars" when talking about the day-to-day show to the actors and the intransigent performances.
You can’t miss a movie or you won’t catch up with the trend.
This week I had a conversation with Fleiss, outside Kauai’s north coastal house under 80 degrees, but he hid inside the house to watch MSNBC while filming for CNN.
He couldn’t leave the most television screens when Brett Kavanaugh was running before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on the table.
“I remember the days we did those crazy shows and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from the outside flows into the election in the middle of the gayest season for the race to the White House.
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency is witnessing a cash rainstorm, due to the rearrangement of the parliamentary constituency that caused the two delegates to race in the same seat.
The recent geographical rearrangement in Pittsburgh County has sparked Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is racing with Republican candidate Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, having multiple localities in common with the new 17th district.
The main map was redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old counties were arranged for fraud in the direction of favourable to the Republican Party.
The race in the new 17th district has become a financial race between the party’s financial institutions, the Democratic Party Committee on the Congressional Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican Committee on the National Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb was a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a star-strike victory in a special election that many followed in March for Pennsylvania's 18th District Congressional Area.
This position previously belonged to the Republican Party for more than a decade and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the county.
Political commentators have assessed the Democratic Party higher.
The U.S. has considered sanctions against El Salvador for China's backing, but has since withdrawn.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Beijing, and Washington has barely raised any objections.
President Trump had a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and the president had once owned a hotel in Panama until business partners fired the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama have resigned millions of U.S. diplomats due to “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” Heather Nauert said in a statement.
But the penalty is only weighty for El Salvador, the country has received <0x24>140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions for some subjects, would cause major losses to this Central American country with high unemployment and criminality rates.
As internal meetings were taking place, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic issues to reorganize a similar meeting last year that was once seen as a step forward in an effort to stop immigrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials had declared that they wanted to continue the conference, helping to end sanctions against the United States' El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to speak at the conference, which is scheduled to take place in mid-October, when there are signs of taking administrative measures.
And three U.S. special envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions under anonymous conditions.
Their information has been verified by an outside analyst who has close ties to the government and also anonymized statements.
History of research.
The next bomb could be a report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on Trump’s obstruction of justice, which is now a lot of evidence in the public record.
People say that Mueller is shifting his investigation to a dispute between President Trump and Russia during the presidential election.
If there is a party change in parliament, President Trump will have a lot of trouble in parliament, just before the campaign's election preparations, and even with people in the same party.
There are a lot of problems, I don’t mean that President Trump’s departure is inevitable – just like his peers in Europe.
Both sides of the Atlantic need to make choices, and this will affect the length of the struggle.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to carry out a major coup against Hitler, if the West also agreed to oppose and support the Soviet Union in Munich.
We have failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre.
History revolves around such milestones, and the unrelenting struggles of the democratic party will increase or be postponed.
The Americans faced some of these stamps.
What would happen if President Trump fired Deputy Justice Rod Rosenstein, who controlled the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been sitting in the fire since there was a report last year about his proposal to secretly listen to the president and speculate that the president is not in line with the office.
Mr. Rosenstein's academy testified that the information of the Times was inaccurate.
“How would we react if the new F.B.I. investigation into Brett Kavanaugh was incomplete or unfair – or if he confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonesty?
Most importantly, will we vote in the middle of a term for a Congress so that this agency will force Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail in these challenges, democracy will lose its power for a long time.
But I believe that we will not fail, because I have a lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish Turk who was expelled to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that occupied our home.
She survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, she gave me the opportunity to light a candle on the altar on the Sabbath.
With my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans' Optimism Belongs to the Ranger Team Before a Collider with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers played against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, when they learned that winning against the Austrians, after an impressive match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would give them an advantage to win the G-table of the Europa League.
The knee injury prevented defender Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season until a 2-2 match with Villarreal but he believed the Rangers could use that result as a table for better things.
"It's a good thing for us because Villarreal is a strong team," the 31-year-old said.
“We’ve been in the game with the confidence that we’ll win one point.
We can win at the end of the game, but the balance is also a good result.
They may well have played better in the first round but we have reacted in the second round and have a better attitude.
Next Thursday will be an important game in Europe.
Hopefully we can win three points but it will be a difficult game because they have had good results in the previous game, but with the fans’ friction, I’m sure we can get over and win good results.
“Last year was a difficult time, I was injured and the changes in the club, but now I feel very good.
The team is good, the players have good grades and good training quality.
Hopefully we can continue to go deeper to sow a successful new season.”
Women Are Worried About Sleep Loss due to Retirement Savings
Although the facts of the survey participants are all clear about what they care about, fewer people talk to family members.
Approximately half of the participants of the Nationwide study said they had talked to their spouse or husband about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about this.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance business at Nationwide.
Here are the steps to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare the spirit for the family to take care of you if you don’t express your desire in advance.
Talk to your counselor and family to discuss the location and how to be cared for, as those choices can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Follow your financial advisors: Your advisors can also help you out how to pay for those costs.
Your financial choices for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, life insurance policies worth the money to help you cover these costs, or buy insurance yourself with your own money – as long as you have the money.
Preparation of legal documents: Avoid legal battles that may occur.
There are health care plans available so that you can designate a trusted individual to supervise the medical care process and ensure that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the authorization of your financial account.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid if you are not capable enough.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your parents are in a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Write down the details so that you are always ready.
"It's not just a financial issue, it's a medical issue." Martin asked.
“What medications are there?
Who will take care of the dog?
You’ve already made a plan.”
Man Shot Many Shotguns in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a gun on his way home at night.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, stomach and hands.
Police have described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an "automatic action."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Waves in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, the death toll is expected to continue to increase.
The contact was cut off, and the rescue workers were unable to get any information from the Donggala government, a region north of Palu near the heart of the 7.5-degree Richter earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some major events about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating 40 years of earthquakes and tsunamis.
Donggala is a 300 km (180 miles) long capital along the northwestern coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The capital, an administrative district of the province, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are two key sectors of the economy in the province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important industry here, but mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been attacked several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a hurricane killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A storm also landed in western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Rim area and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and waves that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami attack in 14 countries, killing 226,000 along the Indian Ocean, more than half of which belong to the province of Ac.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes attacked the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake in southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, caused a tsunami on the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital city in eastern Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake on one of the islands of Mentawai, off the Sumatra coast, caused a 10-metre hurricane, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake attacked the Pidie Jaya capital in Aceh, causing damage and panic as people remember the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and the deadly tsunami.
The earthquake did not cause a wave, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes have attacked Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly concentrated in the north of the island.
The quake has destroyed thousands of buildings and trapped thousands of tourists temporarily.
Sarah Palin’s son is arrested for domestic violence.
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for the attack.
Palin, 29, in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a report of domestic violence and opposition to the arrest warrant, according to a report published Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a woman tried to call the police to report the crime, he had picked up the phone.
Palin is being detained in Mat-Su and must file a <0x24>500 non-guarantee bail, according to the KTUU report.
He appeared in court on Saturday, claiming he was "certainly not guilty" when asked to plead, according to the report.
Palin faced three A-class crimes, which means he could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He was also charged with B-class lightweight, imprisoned for one day and fined <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the incident.
The case is currently pending at the Alaska Former Warrior Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an unwavering state of affairs.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by former militant groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of people die
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that struck Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-degree quake has caused the tide and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been cut off with the number of deaths expected to continue to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just outside the center of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
The video is being posted on social media shows the moment of the disaster.
Hundreds of people concentrated on a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tide struck.
Federal prosecutors are proposing the death penalty for suspected NYC terrorist attack
New York state prosecutors are proposing the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people - a rare punishment not yet incurred in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on October 10.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injuries, according to a notice of a proposal for a death penalty request, filed in New York's South District.
Both of these crimes can be sentenced to death, according to the court’s documents.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury accused Saipov of 22 counts of murder, including eight counts of murder, often used by federal prosecutors in organised criminal cases and prosecutions.
The attack required "planning and billions of dollars," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov conducted it was "smooth, cruel and inhuman".
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian's announcement"
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since New York’s Southern District passed the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually convicted in September 2009.
The last execution in a federal case in New York was in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union two years ago.
Rosenberg's husband was executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbekist, did not express regret after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was feeling good about what he was doing, police said.
Saipov told officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS video on his phone, according to the statement.
He also demanded that ISIS be hanged in the hospital room, police said.
He has not been convicted of 22 counts of crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys who represented Saipov, said they were "completely disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
“We think that a decision to execute the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction with a general prison sentence without the possibility of release would only prolong the injury of this event to those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s cell-based lawyers have previously asked prosecutors not to issue the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say Nigel Farage should take responsibility for negotiating Brexit
Nigel Farage said he would "move the people" in a protest at a conservative party summit.
Former Ukip leader said politicians had to “feel the heat” of those who are in doubt about European terrorism – as one of Prime Minister Theresa May’s congressmen suggested he should be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
Conservative supporter Peter Bone said during a campaign in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "go out of the alliance" right now if Farage were Brexit minister.
But the challenge that Prime Minister May faces as she tries to reconcile the deep divide between conservative MPs, in support of the European Union’s stay, has taken part in a protest against Brexit.
The prime minister is squeezing things to keep a firm compromise plan between the attacks on Brexit supporters, the remainder of Brexit supporters and the European Union.
The Allies insisted she would push by trying to reach an agreement with Brussels despite a fierce reaction – and forcing Europeans and the Labour Party to choose between her plans and her “debate.”
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that he wanted to ‘oppose the Chequers’ plan.
He suggested Farage should be in the Senate and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, now we’re probably out of the alliance,” he said.
Senator Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit but we need to oppose the Chequers plan."
He expressed his opposition to the European Union: “We do not fight in world wars to subjugate others.
“We want to build our own law.”
Bone rejected the proposal that opinions had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay united is completely wrong.”
The Brexit supporter of the Conservative Party, Andrea Jenkyns, was also present at the demonstration, speaking to reporters: "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Not many people are contributing to the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for this plan, this usually does not happen to our party, our activists, who are willing to call for the support of the people and vote for us from the start.
Give up the Chequers plan and listen to the people.’
In a message sent to May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their chair when they keep their promises to the people.”
Farage said politicians had to take part in the protests to “feel the heat” if they changed the decision made during the 2016 referendum.
"This is a matter of faith between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
“They’re trying to give up Brexit and we’re here today to say ‘we’re not going to let you do that.’”
In a message to supporters, he added: “I want the political class, who are planning to change Brexit, to feel the warmth of the current situation.
“We are moving people who have brought Brexit to victory and we will never give up until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK,” he said.
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour demonstration in downtown Birmingham.
Some high-profile activists signify the Conservative Party against Brexit after launching the group this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis has made a joke to the Guardians about the security issues they are facing during the opening conference.
“These are people who have told us that they can control the IT system and all the technologies that Canada provides, including the issue of free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s totally a joke.
“Brexit is not a good thing,” he added.
Warren plans to 'elect' the presidential seat.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would decide to be "presidential" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about her future when she spoke at the Massachusetts City Hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is re-elected in November, in a race with GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who once co-chaired Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
People think she could take on Trump’s position in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the city hall since President Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her about the intention to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to get involved in politics to reform government and need a woman to lead.”
Arrested in the murder of LSU's Sims player
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., said a suspect had been arrested in the shooting of LSU baseball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man in the film.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the University of Southern campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in the head and was killed," police chief Murphy J. Paul said in a statement on sports channel 247.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene, possessing weapons and confessing to shooting the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was immediately arrested and detained at the East Baton Rouge Church Police Station.
As a 1.98m tall teenager and growing up at Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games with 10 in the official squad in the previous season with an average playing time of 17.4 minutes, winning 5.6 points and 2.9 tables.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins world championship after winning against Sebastian Vettel
Valtteri Bottas clearly had an advantage over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday as Mercedes remained a strong team in the season.
From the start, Bottas had a good start and continuously surpassed Hamilton to defend his position in the first two rounds and made Vettel have to fight his own teammates.
Vettel got into the first pit and left Hamilton when he got back on the race track, a decisive move.
The Mercedes entered the pit behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead because the rider on the Ferrari had to slow down to avoid risk after two stints to defend third place.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the race and to the seventh place when he finished one straight on his 21st birthday.
He then led throughout the race without changing tyres to a quick goal and overtook Kimi Raikkonen to win fourth place.
He finally got into the pit in the 44th lap but couldn't speed up in the remaining eight laps when Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a gay race because Valtteri had a very good race over the weekend and it was really a cool racer.
The team finally had an excellent race to win the number one and number two positions," Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday’s election campaign as she insisted that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford on the Supreme Court’s allegation of sexual assault in Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking during the election campaign on the West Bank of Virginia, the president did not directly target the announcement Ford made before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "unintentional and unintended."
"There's been a story going on and what's going on in the last few days in the Senate is amazing, you can feel anger, you can see people angry, bad and unpleasant and dishonest," he said.
“When they saw the papers and read the news leaked, they said, ‘Oh, I’m not the one who did that.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked the news, right?
Remember her answer... she leaked the paperwork, didn't she? "God, what's going on?
No, no, no, no.
I didn't run away."
Come on, wait a minute.
We leaked... No, we don’t do that,” the president repeated the senator’s words.
Feinstein sent Ford a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July and information leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that her office was leaking information.
“I don’t hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I don’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep a secret and I kept a secret as she asked.”
But the president seems dissatisfied with her refusal behavior and he commented in the election campaign on Saturday night: “I’ll tell you about it, it’s really a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to protect the Supreme Court’s nominee, who has been charged with sexual abuse by three women, the president says the Democratic Party is using the allegations for its own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power in every way.
You’ll see meaning and discomfort because they don’t care who will hurt, they want power and control,” Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars win 5-3 against Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in the match against Dundee
The Dundee Stars offset the Belfast Giants on Friday in the Elite League with a 5-3 win in the return on Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had two goals early on with the scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie made a deal for the home team before Dwyer scored more points for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard went on to clear Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals to help the team win the final.
It was the third loss in the team's Elite League season led by Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee by 2-1 in the match that took place in Belfast on Friday evening.
It was the fourth touchdown between the two this season, and the Giants won in the previous three games.
Dwy's opening table in the fourth minute when the clock was only 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford also helped Beauvillier double the table separately four minutes later.
In the early minutes, Sullivan helped the home team shorten the number in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt became the player who helped Cownie beat the number in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the 1st round when he scored the second goal at the end of the round.
The home team agreed and Bouchard again scored with a stunning score at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the end of the second round and he scored fifth for his team in the final minutes of the match.
The Giants have lost four in the last five games, and are now resting to wait for the next match against Milton Keynes on Friday.
Aviation Control Staff Killed Their Lives to Save Hundreds of Passengers On Airplane Escape From Earthquake
Indonesian air traffic controllers are being hailed as a hero after their birth to ensure that the plane carries hundreds of passengers safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many disappeared after a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday caused a tsunami.
Strong protests continued in the area and many were trapped in the ravages in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to keep him alive, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower swirling because of the strong winds at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that the aircraft carrying Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the ice at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air-saving control tower because he thought it was collapsed.
And then he died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision had saved lives, according to Australia’s ABC News.
We were preparing a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he stopped breathing before the plane arrived at Palu.
“Our hearts are broken when we receive this news,” he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, a spokesman for the national disaster relief agency said it was difficult to access the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll continues to rise as many bodies remain trapped under the rubble and we have not yet reached many people," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
The six-metre-high waves have devastated Palu, where the funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military aircraft and commercial aircraft provide auxiliary supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute that passes, there are ambulances carrying the bodies.
Clean water is very rare.
Small markets are being plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is racing to support the survivors but we don’t know how the situation is there.
It’s a tragedy, but the situation can get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and spoke before the national army: “I wish you all will work day and night to complete all the missions related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini: Air Niugini says a man is missing after plane crashes at sea
The airline's flight operator, which crashed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, said a missing man was missing, after a previous speech that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the plane being sunk.
Air Niugini said in a press release that, until Saturday afternoon, we could not find a male passenger.
The airline said it had worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request to provide additional information about passengers, such as their age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events has not yet been identified.
The air force and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the debris just after leaving the track.
Some witnesses believe that the plane was missing the track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was at very low altitude.
"It's a good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others could sail through deep water to the swamp to reach the emergency evacuation doors on the plane that was sinking.
He said the flight attendants were shocked and screamed, and he was slightly injured in the head.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby while repairing the harbour also helped rescue by using a harbor to pick up people on board before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the airline’s security network showed that 111 people had died in an airline accident registered in the PNG network for the past two decades but there were no incidents related to Air Niugini.
Analysts say the girl's time at night has been burned alive.
Based on Saturday's records in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Defense analyst Paul Rowlett has testified in court for hours as an intelligence analyst.
He proved to the jury how to use mobile records to synthesize the movement of the accused Quinton Tellis, 21, and the victim Jessica Chambers, 19, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he had received location data from a number of cell phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous statement, Clarion Ledger reported.
The data show that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers's while he said he was with a friend named Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified in court on Saturday and certified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck is in Nashville."
Another contradictory detail is that Tellis says he knows Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for about a week.
Rowlett said that occasionally after Chambers' death, Tellis erased Chambers' messages, calls, and contacts from his phone.
“He’s got you out of his life,” Hale said.
Lawyers are expected to start a closed debate on Sunday.
The judge said he awaited the trial of the jury on that day.
High Breed Group: What is Active Hip Hop?
The three hip hop artists want to oppose the negative perceptions of the genre by putting the positive messages into their music.
The High Breed group, from Bristol, stated that hip hop no longer conveys political messages and addresses social issues.
The group wants to bring this category to the correct source and re-open the positive hip hop lineup.
Recently, artists such as Fugees and Common have gained more popularity in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
NY's sister sues her husband who fired her after a message of "racial discrimination"
A sister in New York Nanny sued a couple who fired her for discriminatory treatment after she missed a wrong message from her mother complaining she was "a black man."
Couples reject them as racially discriminatory, deeming the case to be a “money robbery.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when she discovered that her new sister, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman on her first day of employment in 2016.
“No, I don’t, I don’t know about the blacks,” Plasco-Flaxman told her husband.
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the confusion, Plasco-Flaxman "displeasedly" dismissed Maurice, she said her African breasts were about to quit their job and that she hoped to have a Filipino breast, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid a day’s wages and went home with Uber herself.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple to claim compensation for their dismissal behavior with a compensation of <0x24>350 a day for the six-month period for the job she was hired to receive the money even though they did not sign any contracts.
“I want to show them, look, you shouldn’t do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know that’s discrimination.”
The couple objected to the allegations that they were racially discriminatory, saying that Maurice's job termination was reasonable because they feared they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message that she wasn’t going to send.
She's not a racially differentiated person.
We are not racially differentiated people,” Joel Plasco, the husband, told the Post.
“But can you give your child to someone you’ve offended, even if it’s because of mistakes?
What about the newborn baby?
Let's talk."
When comparing the case to a “money laundering,” Plasco said his wife had a baby for two months and was in “very difficult circumstances.”
“How would you treat someone like that?
This is not something that should be done,” the investment banker added.
While the legal case was taking place, the residue’s comments were quickly tapping into the couple’s social media channels, citing their behavior and the logic of the story.
Publisher Paddington fears that readers will not care about the story of a bear who knows how to talk, the letter said.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was widely accepted by readers, revealing the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in someone else’s position when reading the book for the first time is published.
It’s great that we know now about Paddington’s great success.”
Speaking of his father, a filmmaker for the BBC before being inspired to write a book for children from a small toy bear, he still felt optimistic when his work was rejected, when she shared the following year’s “60th Anniversary”.
Speaking of Paddington, she described herself as "a very important member of our family," she added her father was always silently proud of her success.
"You're a pretty decent man, and you're not an explosive," she said.
“But because Paddington really exists with him, it’s almost like having a child and it’s got some successes: you’re proud of them even when they don’t really exist.
I think you've done Paddington that way.
Although it was the product of his creativity and imagination, he always won a certain place for Paddington."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye by phone.
As soon as her daughter landed, she was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life but was useless.
“I call Nad regularly to say that this is bad and she probably doesn’t have to,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“After that, I received a call from Nad saying that she would stop breathing in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll see you soon.
I will always be with you.
The doctors pumped cardiac aids and gradually pulled the tube out of the girl’s body.
She stopped breathing a few times and this was the last time.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was still not over.
I can’t cry or cry or cry or cry because I’m with my family and everyone else.
I must be the one who binds them.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now still saddened by the daughter’s departure, boarded a plane with the other passengers — faced with the challenge she would have to overcome.
"No one knows," she said.
“I bowed my head and cried all the time.
It was hard to explain, but when I was on the flight I felt sorry for Nad.
The boy needs my love and understanding.
I know how much I love her.”
The sad woman filed a postcard to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women who have lost free relatives are trying to stop others from robbing themselves of their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted these cards on the Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Davis's son, 13-year-old Tyler, suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to be in the feelings I have to experience every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, living in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a smiling smile.
“Everyone knows about it because of that laughter.
They often say the boy’s laughter lights up every room.”
However, she quit her job before committing suicide because she finds herself "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, also left as his own brother after his life ended.
Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that there will be a line-up reaction."
Ms. Davis designed the boards, "to let people know that there are always people for you to meet, chat, or even make friends.
Don’t live in silence – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, a friend born 15 years ago, not long after his mother’s death.
“He’s not talking about feeling bored or disappointed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed he was changing his attitude.
He was bored at school on Christmas Day - when the kids opened the gift and he didn't want to look at them or anything around."
She said that her husband’s death was a huge loss to them, but they still had to try to get through: “This has caused a huge gap in our family.
It destroys our hearts.
But we all continue to live and fight it.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is slipping when the FBI begins investigations.
Mr. Flake said on Saturday, "I think, if we can really get something like what he's asked for -- a time-limited, scope-limited investigation, we can pick up a little bit of the peasantry," he added that he feared that the peasants would "remain."
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their destiny is just a matter of time.
The midterm elections have been going on for five weeks, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans who are currently in very poor condition would be weaker in an effort to find the representatives they want to vote in the highest seats.
George W. Bush called Senators, acting in the corridor to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who was former White House assistant under President Bush, from which he could access his wife Ashley, who was formerly President Bush’s personal secretary.
What Happened After The FBI Announced The Reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there will be 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes from the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, who is now vice president, to remove the knot and confirm the candidate's position in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Koreans who fled 'strongly' under Kim's reign
The number of North Koreans has fallen sharply since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a lawmaker in South Korea said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Korean Unity, said there were 1,127 excavations last year - compared to 2,706 excavations in 2011.
Park said tightening control of the border between North Korea and China and the large proportion of traffickers arrested were key factors for this change.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.
Most of those who have fled North Korea are finally granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the refugees flee through China, the country with the longest common border with North Korea, and they can easily cross the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that is strictly protected between the two countries.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forces them to return to the country.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea - technically still in a state of war - have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the issue of denuclearization.
These moves took place following a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, both sides agreeing to expanded terms to advance North Korea’s non-nuclear hemisphere.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the U.S. sanctions that caused delays in the process.
“If there is no trust on the American side, there will be no trust on our national security issues, and in such a case, there is no other way that we will find a solution for our own congress,” Ri said in a speech at the New York General Assembly.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "too excited," and said he wasn't fit for a position in the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee for a position in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh was "too excited" and said he was temporarily inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help, but I think if a woman has done that, they'll call it 'too excited'," Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Justice Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh insisted on denying allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while both were young.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh expressed a lot of emotion, there were moments he was almost screaming and skeptical when talking about his family and five months of high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democratic Party before the committee, calling for the allegations against him to be an "assassination as planned" act angered by Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's statement proved that he was inappropriate for a position in the Supreme Court, as he clearly demonstrated anti-democracy behavior.
“I think you’ve eliminated your self-esteem when you make your statements and your way of dealing when you talk about the Clinton family and the Democratic Party,” she said.
Pelosi refused to ask if she was trying to accuse Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democratic Party won a majority in the House.
“I’ll say this—if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he’s not just going to be in the Supreme Court, but he’s going to have to go to court,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Prosecutor's Office.
Pelosi added, as a Democrat, she was interested in Kavanaugh's ability to make a ruling against the Health Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
During the interrogation, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he changed some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
“This isn’t a time for an over-excited person to sit in court and hopefully we’ll say, ‘This isn’t great,’” Pelosi said.
Women need to know how to take advantage.
This was really a heavy criticism, month after month, year after year, and she couldn’t get over it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me after 45 years.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, my friend.”
She continued, "I've been a woman who helped a lot, she's a senior director, she said she's also crying when she's angry but to make up a reaction when she's angry and start crying, she's going to tell the person she's just talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm upset.
I'm angry."
And you keep crying.
And I think this is great."
You are allowed to cry for this behavior to be part of the escape to anger because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my deepest memories of working at the first company was that it was a place for men only, I used to cry when there was an outburst of anger, that was when I was hit by an older woman - the cold manager who always made me feel scared - I was scared.
She said to me, “Never let them see you crying.”
“They didn’t know you were angry.
They think you’re sad and happy because they’re next to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, later a Democratic MP in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested on a ship called Monkey Business and left the race, Mrs. Schroeder was extremely disappointed, arguing that there was no reason why she could not stand in the presidential race on her own.
Thirty years later she laughed and said to me, "It's not a smart decision."
“There have been seven other candidates in the race, and they need another candidate.
Someone has called this race "The Snowman and the Seven Storms."
Due to her late participation in the campaign, she was lost in the fund-raising campaign, so she vowed that she would not participate in the campaign unless she raised <0x24>2 million.
The war has failed.
She found that some supporters gave her <0x24>250 instead of <0x24>1,000 to support the male candidate.
She asked herself, “Do they think I’m discounted?”
When she declared that she was not going to start an official campaign, she overcame the emotion – expressing gratitude to those who supported her, disappointed with the system that made the fund-raising process so difficult and targeted the voters more than the bully.
“You might think I’ve had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
“You thought Kleenex was the sponsor of my company.
I remember thinking about what they would put on my grave?
“Are you crying?”
The U.S.-China trade war could be a good signal for Beijing
Experts say that the initial bailouts for the US-China trade war have been stalled, and the war will continue, the crackdown between the two countries may be an advantage to Beijing.
Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning by taxing China’s main export items including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
The escalation has increased in recent weeks with a <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) tax rate affecting half of China’s imported goods into the United States.
Beijing has repaid by raising taxes from five to ten percent to <0x24>60 billion in U.S. commodities.
China is committed to retaliation corresponding to the actions of the US and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to be stagnated early.
Washington’s captivation is synonymous with Beijing’s having to make demands, but publicly losing to the U.S. is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing is able to put the right flags, the long-term pressure of the trade war with the US could be a positive signal for China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a political decision in Washington or Beijing could both start an economic relationship in one of the two countries and this is actually much more dangerous than previously acknowledged,” Abigail Grace, an Asian-focused research expert at the New Security Center, said in a statement.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, Foreign Minister Says <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Syria says it is ready to let refugees voluntarily return and is calling for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by the seven-year war.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are being improved.
“Today, the state has been more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore living conditions.
All the current conditions are ready for refugees to voluntarily return due to the fact that they have left the country because of terrorism and the economic conditions that affect their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still live in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept conditional aid or help from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States with a final rate of 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National in the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the championship when Danish team captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points in defeating the American team.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who has participated in most tournaments, threw his ball into the water at the third ball in the 16th hole, admitting he lost Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer’s hand, Molinari, lit up in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever won 5-0-0 since the current season began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with a 5 & 4 ratio by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
World-leading player Dustin Johnson, who lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, may have played the final Ryder Cup in his career.
A former Ryder Cup eight-season player, Spanish Sergio García has become the greatest champion of any tournament with a total score of 25.5.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop it.
It’s really been a tough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing and trusting me.
I am very happy to get the cup.
About my team, I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said of the feelings behind the European victory.
He handed the ball over to fellow player John Ram, who defeated the legendary American Tiger Woods with a number 2-1 in a singles game on Sunday.
"It's proud to be able to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up and admire him very much," Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup tournaments.
Statistics of one of the greatest players of all time show that he has won 14 major titles and is just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has tried their best to find tickets for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who are the top qualifiers of the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the players, they've fought very well.
This morning we were having a hard time because of the high temperatures in Europe.
We've been eliminated.
Thank you, Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 players in the team played very well.
We will focus on the team, I will play the PGA in the US and the Ryder Cup and we will continue to win the top of the table.
I love all 12 players and I’m proud to be a captain.
I would like to say hello to you guys.
We played very well."
