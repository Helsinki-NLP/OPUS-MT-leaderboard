Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech: Transfer to the last minute?
Anything is possible
Today is the last day you can skip the transfer window and make a big move.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, currently Chelsea’s substitute goalkeeper, is not currently sitting on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits at the NH Hotel in Smíchov, talks to Czech journalists and is preparing with the Czech team for the game general with the Americans and then also for the sharp start of the qualification for Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea's new Premier League season, Thibaut Courtois is favored, and the Czechs have been replaced for the first time in ten years at the London club.
It was speculated a long time ago that the Czechs might be interested in Real Madrid.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup to Athletics at the start of the season and failed to enter the league season when he lost 2:4 to San Sebastián.
It also speculated about the interest of Paris SG.
On Sunday, St. Etienne scored 5–0 with two wins and two draws in the French league.
The boots of AS Monaco are relatively the most pressed.
He has a 1-1-2 balance in the league so far and broke away with Lille peacefully 1-1 on the weekend.
There are rumors that the Czechs may want to join the Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, Chech's departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet scored a 4:1 on him.
Peter, is it possible that you will change your shirt in the next few hours?
I'm not counting on it, but there's never a hundred percent difference in football.
For example, during the day there will be an offer that will not be rejected.
What would such an offer look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know yet what an offer like that, which can't be rejected, actually looks like.
First of all, it would depend on Chelsea’s position to decide whether the club’s possible offer would be resolved or not.
Is it technically feasible to make such a move now that you are in Prague?
Wouldn’t it be necessary to sign a new contract somewhere in the new office?
So I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation, there are a lot of players today, all of them are somewhere in the squad, and there are certainly a lot of moves going on today.
So it would be somehow feasible.
How many clubs on the planet could afford you?
I really don't know.
So you're not pushing to leave?
The situation where I didn’t win the first three games of the new season is a new one for me after fifteen years of career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack and go somewhere.
“I want to continue to fight for Chelsea’s position and he’s on the coach he’s going to choose what decision he will make in the coming weeks.
What role does family play in your decision-making?
I take all the factors into account.
Of course, the sporting point of view is important to me, but I also look at it from a personal point of view, which of course belongs to the needs of the family.
Is it possible that you would catch for another club in England?
That's the question that I thought would never concern me.
In football, anything is possible.
I don't want to exclude anything.
I don't know the answer.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan to meet in Tokyo
India’s new Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Tokyo to meet his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abem and discuss economic and security commitments on his first major visit since the May election victory.
Modi is on a five-day journey to Japan to establish economic ties with the world’s third largest economy.
The list includes, first and foremost, plans for broader cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
According to reporters, India also hopes that both nations will agree to cooperate on defence issues.
Police arrested a 20-year-old man in Karrata after a motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was stopped after the maximum permitted 70 km/h zone crashed 125 km/h and entered the bush to escape the police.
Traffic guards in Karrata in the morning tried to stop the blue motorcycle by the border when they noticed that it was 125 km/h when leaving the station on Bathgate Road.
According to police, the driver did not stop and continued along Burgess Road and then drove into the bush, so the police lost him out of sight.
The motorcycle and the person who responded to the driver's description were then spotted at the house in Walcott Way, Bulgaria.
Karrath police have accused a 20-year-old boy of disobeying a call for arrest and negligence.
The trial in Karrata will take place on September 23.
The motorcycle was seized for three months.
George Webster accused of rape in hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
The man will be prosecuted on charges of rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was found guilty during a hearing at the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
On June 7, 2013, he allegedly raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire.
Webster claimed to have attacked her while she was “not conscious, asleep, and unable to give her consent.”
Webster is also prosecuted for rape of another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scotland on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date of the trial for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Renewing the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights at the same time
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law that aims to protect trade unions as civil law.
“According to how trade unions work, jobs for the middle class work,” said Ellison, a Minnesota Democratic Senator who co-chairs the Congressional Committee.
That is why I am so proud to be able to present, together with John Lewis, a model of occasional rights, a law that strengthens the status of employees.
This breakthrough legislation gives workers the same legal opportunity to fight discrimination in the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and will stop anti-Council forces
To amend the Labour Relations Act so as to allow all employees who are discriminated against if they want to engage in trade unions, be tried in a civil court - and judge compensation or damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative – at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other lawmakers are proposing is to reconnect to the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states – Americans once supported countries around the world to embrace, expand and respect labor rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them, when the countries once again promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Toja's military autocracy would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their trade unions played a role in the formation of a new Japan, included language in them, and openly acknowledged that “the right of employees to gather, negotiate and act collectively is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers challenged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to be organised and promoted in the new nation, and therefore included a clause that openly states: “The right to form associations that will ensure and improve the working and economic conditions of every profession or profession.
Agreements that will limit this right or endeavour to damage it will be cancelled. Measures leading to the fulfilment of such a purpose are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, it included the drafters of the law and the "supervisors of the law" in the "Roosevelt Garage"
Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When the country worked with other countries to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create labor unions – and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as equal partners – must be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the trade unions have not reduced the strength of the nation, but expanded it.
They have increased the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and raised production to an unprecedented level.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn’t forget, and we shouldn’t.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - has a great delay.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have raised America and made it a real promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana
The federal judge temporarily blocked Louisiana law on Sunday, which, according to lawyers, is likely to shut down all five clinics in the state.
A decree signed by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is due to enter into force on September 1, would require doctors who carry out treatments to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge’s decision means that doctors may temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions and, in the meantime, have to obtain this authorization.
“The proposing party will be able to legally carry out its activities and in the meantime get permission,” said federal judge John deGravellese.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a permanent resolution on the law.
Activists for abortion rights, the latest in a series of similar measures, welcomed the resolution and said it would give doctors more time to get permission.
“Today’s decision ensures that women in Louisiana are safe from a fake law to prepare them for their health and their rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who, in the name of three of the five clinics, went to jail.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also concerns doctors from two clinics that were not among the complainants, and they are also applying for this authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures unconstitutional.
Key parts of Texas law that would shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state would be blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for women’s rights to abortion, together with the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, claim that the need to have this permission puts on doctors demands that are medically unnecessary.
Opponents of abortions have argued that the measures are aimed at protecting women’s health, and some have also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed as a result of the measures.
According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, only one doctor in Louisiana is allowed to perform abortions.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop carrying out abortions, the doctor would also stop carrying out the procedure out of fear of his safety, the group said.
In response, Louisiana authorities said they would not punish doctors who carry out abortions while awaiting the settlement of a lawsuit.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment kills ovarian cancer more often in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video with a hold of her deceased mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their peers in the city.
The researchers analyzed medical records of more than 1,100 Australians diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived five years after the diagnosis.
Researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
MANY STUDY: New medications may slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers monitored the woman over the course of seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival were influenced by the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, another existing disease, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in older women who had been diagnosed with cancer at an advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that factors can be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
“The disease is best treated by gynecologists who usually live in larger cities,” she said.
Despite improvements in distance medical services to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transport services that will allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are being treated away from their parents and their families.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of their geographical location, emphasizing the need for better treatment and preventive programs.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer today published the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret the reduction in the number of homeowners
According to an HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary loss of homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to a young generation of consumers reaching “the main age group of gardeners,” one hundred gardeners, and a million-dollar garden centers.
According to the report, people renting homes will spend 55 per cent on average of the amount spent by people living in their own gardens.
As another risk factor for the sector, which is estimated to earn <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion a year, the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas where there are no gardens, the preference for irrigation instead of gardens used as a parking space, and the declining size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where the share of owned homes fell from 61% to 43% in six years, one household has the lowest expenditure on gardening products in the UK.
HTA and the Royal Garden Company stated that living in rent or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardener advisor for the RHS, said: “In tenants, growing plants in flowerpots is very popular – when they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
Also for this year it predicted a higher takeover due to better weather, which came after unfavorable conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin saved his youth organization, which reminds me most of all of Hitler’s youth, with atomic weapons and essentially made it clear to everyone that their views were stolen from him, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have such a feeling that the current regime in Russia exhibits many features of a fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is, that they can be controlled by both shattered nationalism and that the complex of minorities can be transformed into imperialist cradles.
The weather seems to be different in the east than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of war for dominance over Europe was long gone, in the East, on the contrary, it thinks that they have been neglected for a long time and it is necessary to regain their international position.
Such mood and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930s, shortly before the Nazis took power, and then the explosion of nationalism followed the unprecedented situation in Russia today.
And then the very same cult of a strong leader, the stalking of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, is indeed quite similar.
Vladimir Putin and certainly a large part of the Russians are probably missing from the time when Russia ruled half the world and the second part trembled before them.
Probably the Western politicians blamed it on themselves, maybe a little Vladimir was crying on his shoulder, maybe they didn’t invite him where he wanted, and maybe they started to underestimate him, and he just behaved like a typical Russian man.
He made an order at home, pretending he didn't want to go anywhere, and grinding his knives at home.
Now he decides to take back the lost position.
It starts slowly, I have time.
He's a leader for life, so where would he hurry?
He killed the Caucasians, now he killed the Ukrainians, then there are the monkeys from the Baltics.
Those Russian bears have been stinging in their skin for a long time.
I’m sure China will notice this as well, which is kind of jumping too far and is certainly making a bump into the Far East.
And the Germans of that Vladimir are pretty good at how well they're doing, and I put it on their ass at 45.
How about a new Novorosija in Karlovy Vary?
It would be a base and there are a lot of ours there, and as they push them out there and the roof they already wanted to take down a lessoner from them.
Our veterans still remember how they were in that Czechoslovakia.
Well, their Prime Minister, Mr. Sobotka, who is so soft, can be stolen like onions and I eat the whole of their EU.
That would be the way to jump on the big Russia.
They need to be reminded of where their place is.
And as explosives, we're going to use our co-workers who live in their territory.
The Russians are everywhere, and if they say they're pushing them out there, they're just pushing them out there, and we're not going to leave it that way, we're going to protect them.
And again, the Russians will rule, for what else is born.
After all, Europe is only good as a template, on which the proud Ivan can dance a cockerel.
Turkey summoned U.S. diplomat for espionage report
Turkey's foreign minister called on the country's highest-ranking U.S. diplomat to explain the report on U.S. and British espionage activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. charge d'affaires and Turkish state officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept said that according to documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analysts, Turkey was a priority target of U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media outlets, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underestimated the importance of the report and said that all major states are monitoring each other.
An older report, according to which the German intelligence service also targeted Ankara, sparked a more outrageous reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones series introduces other tricks of the fourth row
The creators of the Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth row of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted of how the tricks of the fourth row were formed.
The most visible are computer editing of the serial environment and mass scenes, when from the depths of the soldiers becomes a giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf Police Director Accused of Corruption
Complainants on Friday submitted evidence of extortion by police and state officials of the town hall in the self-governing district of Calvia to the Mallorcan public prosecutor’s office.
A police officer in Calvia, on the holiday island of Mallorca, was arrested on charges of high-ranking businessmen and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after he was charged with corruption by several entrepreneurs from Punta Ballena, the street in which most of the bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located.
According to the online Mallorca Diario on Friday, complainants submitted evidence of extortion by police and state officials of the municipality in the self-governing district of Calvia to the prosecutor’s office for the fight against corruption.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish state police for links to the corruption charge and will be heard by the judge along with Navarre.
The Spanish national newspaper ABC quoted dissatisfied owners of night-businesses as saying that the benefit from public actors has a serious impact on their business.
“It’s not about making money for a long time, it’s about surviving,” one of the businessmen told the court.
Don't play with our lives.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf got to the main page of magazines around the world after a video of 18-year-old British tourists who gave oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to oversee drunk and smugglers in the ranks of participants of holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of unfamiliar alcohol tours around bars.
In addition, Playhouse, where the event took place with the provision of oral sex, was forced to close for a year and together with the tour organizers of Carnage bars paid a fine of 55,000 euros (<0x24>73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is popular among the British, has also witnessed many alcohol-induced accidents, including a fashionable wave known as "balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day marked by rain and storms that impacted the flight at Adelaide Airport
JARO brought southern South Australia an ice surprise, came with heavy rain and strong winds that severely hit Adelaide airports.
Another 5 mm precipitation is expected to occur in the city until 9 p.m. and another 6.6 mm will occur overnight on Sunday.
The last rain was introduced along with a few short overlaps associated with the storm and windstorms, which began before eight o'clock in the evening and in about ten minutes brought almost 4 mm of precipitation.
After several early spring doses came after the winter last week, on Monday the temperatures in the city again dropped to just 15.8 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
It is believed that the stormy weather contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane had to land shortly after 19:30, but for a short distance it was hit by a change in speed or wind direction and was forced to postpone the landing.
Wind gusts at Adelaide airport reached a speed of about 50 km/h on the ground at that time.
Flight data showed that the plane had to drop off from the second landing and finally arrived at about 20:40.
The delay in the flight resulted in delays in other flights including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
According to forecasts, the temperature in Adelaide will reach a maximum of 16 <0xC2><0xB0>C on Tuesday and one or two excesses may appear.
Israeli Children Return to School After Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending summers in anti-bomb covers, while during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, they attacked their homes with rockets and minometry, but the schools in Gaza are being attacked.
The beginning of the school brought to communities in the south of Israel noted attacks a sense of joy and excitement, but signs of fighting are still visible.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, the staff of the school that hit the rocket removed the remains from the walls after the mounds and slowly awaiting the return of the children.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re looking forward to it,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibuc Saad and an English teacher at a local school.
Many children in this area already really need to go back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was “a little strange” to go to school all of a sudden.
“We’ve had some difficult moments and we haven’t left the house at all,” she said.
Kibuc, located near the border with Gaza, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the people.
Until the ceasefire last week ended the war, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad remained inside their homes or their homes and fled to safer areas further away from Gaza to escape missiles and mines.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village near the border with Gaza, in which she shot from a Palestinian mining machine killed a four-year-old boy, with the return of the heaviness.
The Minister of Education said about 12 families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in alternate schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza that was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently, adding: “We will provide you with education and security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite peace agreement on Tuesday.
While the ceasefire led to an immediate cessation of fighting, it did not solve key issues such as Hamas’ demand for the end of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers who were killed in the war.
The new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates by Palestinians and the United Nations, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, of which three quarters were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel doubts these figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were radical, although there is no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and minoen fire in Israeli cities in the south of the country.
The Israeli military has carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have been hiding in a hundred UN schools that have turned into temporary shelters.
Due to tens of thousands of people still in hiding, and due to ongoing fighting last week, school officials postponed the start of the school year.
“I hope the school will open soon so that we can complete our education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from the school in Gaza’s largest city.
I'm behind the veil: I'm behind the veil.
Lafatu is suffering from temperatures
The Czech football team met this afternoon in Prague before Wednesday’s preparatory match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualifier against the Netherlands.
From the twenty-three-member squad, the Spartan assailant David Lafata is in trouble, who is suffering from temperatures.
David is not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, there were more players, and David still has some problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"If it's two or three days, or if it's going to be fit tomorrow, it's going to be seen according to his state of health, which our doctor will decide," he added.
The other players are ok.
"Of course someone has some kind of pain, but it's not like they couldn't train or participate in the game on Wednesday with the United States," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called as the last player of Spartan backer Lukas Vách.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, other middle-polarists were also considered.
I have decided on the basis that Lukas is a prospective player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I stand behind it," Vrba said to Vách.
What about <0xC5><0xA0>ural?
We'll see what happens to Lata.
It is not excluded that in the event of health problems, the nomination could still be changed.
For example, on the weekend, the Liberian Josef <0xC5><0xA0>ural, who gave the hattrick, sparked a great performance.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
Let's see how David Lafat will do it.
In the event that there will be no power available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot nominate any of the players who participated in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon there will be a representative training at Strahov, then on Tuesday the classic pre-match training before the USA duel at the Summer Olympics, which will be open to fans and will be followed by an autograph.
The game against the Americans will be played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team will be striving to win the premiere under Vrbo.
In the previous three games, he played two draws and lost one.
The qualifying match against the Netherlands is scheduled for 9 September from 20:45.
A pedestrian goes to the Netherlands to Italy
The wrist is glad that unlike the previous collisions, he has more time for training.
It’s an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice with them certain things that we might not have had as much time before.
Now we will be able to focus only on getting the best possible preparation for the Netherlands,” Vrba said.
The Dutch will be present in Italy on Thursday before the match in Prague and the duel will be followed by former temporary coach Josef Pe<0xC5><0xA1>ice.
He'll give us the information they're from the match.
But it's not just about him, we're going to have a match and shoot and we're going to talk about it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we'll see what changes there will be," Vrba told the bronze medalists of the recent World Championship.
According to highly monitored statistics, the price of apartments in the winter period has risen the most in the last seven years.
According to the housing value index in Australia’s capital RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose by 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to a total increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase rose to 10.9 %, more than doubled for one year by August 2013, but profits were not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless said that Sydney and Melbourne are leading the market.
RP Data shows that apartment prices in Sydney increased by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne by 11.7%.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with an average price increase of between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale was Canberra, which was damaged by state-ordered spending cuts and where prices increased only by 1,4 % during the year.
Lawless said that when spring begins, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the continued high rate of auction sales, the overall high sales rate and the low interest rate, it is likely that the value of housing will increase further over the next three months,” he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never kissed me.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked at the factory, they had a cooler relationship.
Henry tries the comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary interview with his father and is part of the Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and melody is optimistic.
Henry, however, had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After the death of his mother, Henry has undergone "deep" therapy and now thinks about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You’ve never seen his face, you just heard his voice: “Stop with that frame.
Leave the nurse alone.
Get out!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton — when I was a child, they were already adults — went to the bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a glass of beer or the beauty of a cricket hit.
I've never spoken to him like that.
For most of my life, he was a serious guy in the corner who reads newspapers.
Recently, Henry visited Dudley, and although the conditions were better than in his father's time, he looked at what life must have been like for him.
Today there is a little more light, but it's still a dark, smokey, cloudy labyrinth, where flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and smoke.
Dad always went into the bathtub and just lay there, then he could hear how slowly he began to sing for himself, because he was washing the sink from himself.
As I walked around, I realized that he was doing this for years to enjoy the family, and I started to appreciate him more.
Henry, however, had a childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't kiss anyone, he didn't say, "I love you."
When my mother was sick and died, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom
With Frances, who has been married for 25 years, they are still good friends.
Dawn's nice.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of overweight and began to manifest symptoms of diabetes, the doctor said to me, “You have to make a radical change.”
So I started going to a great fitness center and also I had to stick to a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And tired.
No one wants to eat carrots themselves.
The change in Henry’s career may be reflected in his stylish, short-cut beard.
After receiving recognition from critics for his Othello, he plunged into the theater.
It was followed by a comedy full of mistakes and the plots of August Wilson.
It’s a different experience than sitcoms and comedies that have filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him on stage as he was dating someone, and wrote about him in the talent contest New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: “For a long time I was the only black imitator/comic on television.”
He learned to walk.
In addition to being noticed by the public, I also had to learn how to make fun of jokes between 1975 and 1985, to be a star and to perform on TV, and it was really hard.
Lenny v New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors disguised themselves as blacks, Henry eventually performed in it with his comedy for five years.
That's why my family's been awkward.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big stages and learned how to work with the crowd.
What has been “the award-winning main product of British television for years,” but at the same time has also been “a large-scale parody of blacks.”
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters that at the same time ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began broadcast in 1984 and in the 1990s was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Over the next decade, he was taken by advertisements, documents, TV series, and roles in films, but after broadcasting his LennyHenry.tv series on the BBC in 2008, he said, “So what you’re going to do now, Len, it seems a little bit like you’re stuck in one place, or a little bit off.”
Next in the series was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was seriously allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really teach him in school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't dare to do that if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented for the document twenty lines from Othello's final speech and already went into it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It was as if it gave me courage.
“It’s about it. It’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the trial was tough and I've been reading the game for months and months before.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be waiting for trouble, which didn't happen.
Soon he started playing in comedy full of mistakes.
All of a sudden, I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
For a moment, I thought, “You’ve changed.”
There was a technical failure, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for capturing the audience.
“The message in my head said, ‘Before the computer does, you have to play it for ten minutes now.’”
Instead, the theatrical director announced that the show will continue as soon as the problem is resolved.
I walked out of the stage and something inside me said, "Hmm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve this for me.
“You play, so stay in the role.”
Henry v Plotech v Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of the plots was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it’s like a divine sign that says, “This is what you should do.”
Of course, it says it with a strange voice.
So I'm staying with that.
I really like it.
I'm happy in the test room.
Henry, however, remains a comedian’s brain – our conversation is interrupted all the time by humorous performances when he enters and exits the role of an imitator.
I decided not to do stand-ups because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I would say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into a blind alley.
Sometimes, when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I don't like it anymore.
I was wondering if he'd ever be organizing a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with the director who helps to give the outline of the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey - I don't think I'd ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm enjoying acting.
It's fun.
You're still telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers state officials to cure non-existent employees
Kenya has started with the biometric registration of all its state officials to try to remove the government’s non-existent employees from the payroll.
According to the government's statement, employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer receive pay.
The government believes that thousands of people receive a salary even after they have left state service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to avoid corruption in the state administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state loses at least <0x24>1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) a month on the salary of non-existent employees and further abuse of official power.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts even after the employee has died or after the employee leaves the government, BBC reporter Wanyama Chebusiri, the capital of Nairobi, said.
All state officials must go to the identification centres within the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, the government said in a statement.
It also says that anyone who does not get up without sufficient excuses will be excluded from the paycheck.
“By decreasing real public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its economy and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of the government, thereby solving the problem of non-existent employees,” said Anne Waiguru, secretary of intelligence.
Dozens of Turkish policemen arrested for “spiking” against the government
According to local media, 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of “spiking against the government”.
Police have yet to comment on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, 14 high-ranking officials were among the detainees.
Some of them were involved in a December investigation into corruption, which targeted government officials including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and telephone interrogation.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister Erdogan) described their actions as part of the action of Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children in Ukraine have returned to school.
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yace<0xC5><0x88>uk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told reporters that not all schools have reopened, but that he is determined to defend the country for the next generation:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony on 1 September.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk, visited by Jacenukov's daughter, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain the knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated so that children wear embroidered shirts, bring balloons and give flowers to teachers.
In Rhone, the BBC may have found a boss for difficult times.
It brings with it a cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal conclaves of the conservative party.
She has experience from the front lines.
She started her career in consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and into the media world of Pearsons.
For seven years, she served as Executive Director of the Financial Times, resigning when her younger colleague, Pearson's, held the senior position in the parent company.
It is said that her retirement was close to a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former CEO of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise at Whitehall: she became an advisor to the government office.
Her husband is a former member of the City Council.
In May, I described the work of the director as a kalich with a poison.
Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inside the top layer of the BBC’s own leadership hierarchy, but also outside the voice of the public in times of turmoil when things don’t work.
It is an almost unsustainable monopoly that demands a thorough reform.
However, a director would risk coming into a complex company like the Chinese dynasty, dismantling it and thus preparing himself for work.
It's a tough challenge.
If it weren’t so hard, many people would like to see the BBC shrinking – its power, its finances – and how its status is revised.
With the expansion of the scope of competition and the new technology questioning old certainties, the immediate negotiation of concessionary fees for the BBC poses a great danger.
For a modest amount of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public buys a share in something that is probably the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households and costs only 40 pence a day.
In addition, the BBC’s popularity is apparently rising: to 53% of supporters compared to 31% ten years ago.
Models of use of BBC services have changed: Today my newspaper headlines appear on my mobile phone and the shows I missed can be viewed on the iPlayer.
But the BBC continues to be a very beloved and amazing institution.
He needs an amazing director - I hope he found one.
Texas Governor Perry Says Offensive Tweet Has Not Approved
A tweet from Texas governor Rick Perry's official Twitter account, which was released on Sunday, contained an insulting image of a democratic prosecutor who initiated Perry's criminal charge of abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and another one was posted on Perry’s account, which distanced itself from the previous one.
There was a tweet that was not authorised from my account.
“I disagree with the tweet and I pulled it out,” he said in a post.
Perry's assistants did not respond to the queries immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry’s official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet posted an unpleasant, humorous picture of Travis County Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of driving drunk in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay out funds for her office, bringing Perry, a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election, to a grand jury in Austin this month.
“I don’t always drive with three times the limit of alcohol in my blood... but if so, I’m complaining to Governor Perry that I’m being held accountable for it.”
I'm the worst Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry has not been conducted by the Lehmberg office.
Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed by the Republican judge, was in charge of him.
Perry was found innocent and called the charges a tactical, political maneuver.
His skilled legal team has asked the case supervisor’s judge to reject the charge because the use of laws to prosecute the longest serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry suspended the <0x24>7.5 million payout from the state-owned public interest fund, which is headquartered in Travis County and is prosecuting corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection caused a formal complaint from a left-wing group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it's celebrated.
After ending in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign in fifth place on his party committee, Perry responded to speculation that he might have already ended, tweeting with his own photo of how he runs near the lake, saying, “Here I am, South Kairo!”
According to Berkeley, the housing market returns to “normal”
One of London’s most prominent developers warned that the housing market in southeastern England had “returned” to a normal level of activity.
Housing in the capital was the subject of high demand and rising prices and widespread fears of the credit bubble led the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the Berkeley Developer Company for demanding clients, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned from a peak in 2013 to a normal level of transactions.”
The London housing market prospered during the decline, as the capital was flooded by buyers from overseas.
According to the catastrophic authorities, prices in the city jumped 18.5% last year alone, far ahead of the average of 6.7% in England and throughout Wales.
The average sales price of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year and rose to <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, due to the increasing pounds in recent months, London’s property has not been so attractive to foreign buyers – some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and talks about possible “situation taxes” that politicians have come up with before parliamentary elections.
The London real estate firm Foxtons warned last week that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter loan rules, would also slow the market's growth in real estate sales and prices during the second half of the year.
The new Bank of England data on Monday showed a decline in the number of mortgages approved for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has cut its forecast for London real estate prices to 3% for 2015 on the grounds that home prices have already begun to fall.
According to real estate firm WA Ellis, the volume of transactions in London’s most expensive quarters, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has declined by a quarter each year.
Yet the demand for housing in the capital city of Berkeley was a blessing as it increased cash for forward sales to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “Demand for the right, well-looking housing in a good location has remained the same and as a result, forward sales have maintained.”
In June, the company announced that from the beginning of the year to the end of April it sold 3,742 properties, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
Annual profit before tax increased by 40% to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, revenue by 18% to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
On Monday, ahead of Pidgley’s annual meeting, he said Berkeley’s annual returns are expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley's shares on the London Stock Exchange stood at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96.
Hacker Posts Photos of Jennifer Lawrenc Naked
Jennifer Lawren will be attending the 85th Academy Awards.
The photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrenc fled the internet because of a hacker who claimed to have a “list” of photos of hundreds of other beginner actresses.
A spokesman for the Hunger Games movies confirmed that Lawrence’s photos were real and criticized the hacker for “obviously violating privacy.”
The authorities have already been contacted and will be prosecuting anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker's photos, originally published on the 4chan image sharing server, were allegedly obtained thanks to a gap in the Internet storage system of the iCloud app. The alleged list of photos of the hacked victims by BuzzFeed includes the names of Mary-Senna, Mary-Senna, Winth-Senna,Karshi-Senna,Karsh-Senna.
It is unclear how many pictures are authentic, but the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim vs. the Rest of the World" Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope those of you who are viewing photos that my husband and I took in a private home years ago are happy with each other," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from the cable television series "iCarly" and "Victoriaous", however, denied that the photos would be true. On Twitter, she said, "These alleged naked photos of me are PODVRH, people."
It's better to put it in a row. *determined vocabulary*
Buzzfeed on Sunday night announced that spokesman Arianna Grande denied that the alleged photographs were true.
Extraordinary Exhibition from Howard Jacobson's Glorious New Novel About Love and the Letter "J"
They disbanded, this is the best way to describe it, gradually disbanded like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
From time to time, a woman told him that he was too serious, too complex, too sharp, isolated, and perhaps a little sluggish.
And then she shook his hand.
He freely admitted it.
He could kick like a jackass, yes.
The last sacrifice of his ability was a beginning of love, which more than usual promised to ease him from the lonely boredom of life and perhaps even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild gray hair and a flying heart from a village on the northern island, which was even farther and more inhabited than Port Reuben.
She came to the south by an older companion, who Kevern thought was her aunt, who inherited the property in a wet but beautiful valley called, appropriately, Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for years.
The tubes sank, the spiders were dead in the bathtubs, the slimes slipped to the windows, as if they thought it belonged to them, the garden was grazed, and the grass resembled the huge heads of cabbage.
The house looked like a child's storyteller, scary and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
A narrower selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn were sitting on the folding chairs in the long grass, holding their hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, in the absence of a public station, which was supplying the region with comfy music and calming messages, squeezing the old man's navels behind his shoulders, squeezing them behind his back.
You have too big legs.
Because of their natural aggression, they no longer played such songs on the radio.
They weren't banned - they weren't really banned - they just didn't play.
They helped them to get to the deceute, as well as the word deceutetudo itself.
The taste of the people has proven what would never be able to do by regulations and positions outside the law, and just as people choose memoirs in which a poor man becomes rich, cooks and love novels, so ballads are chosen in music.
Cavern made his way down and began playing the imaginary piano and sang the serenade to Aillin's big feet with a rough, comical voice.
The family didn't understand.
"It was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said, automatically attaching two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter "j" before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him he was playing the game with his father.
When you think of the words that started with "j" and didn't put two fingers in front of the kiss, it cost you a penny.
It wasn’t funny at the time, and it wasn’t funny now.
He just knew it was expected from him, it was all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn never heard of anyone.
Even jazz, even if it wasn't built out of the law, they didn't play.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There was only one “if” in life.
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where she would end up.
It's the same with humor.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a humorous song.
Although he hadn't heard of Sammy Davis Junior for ten years, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Due to her age, she could not remember a time when the favorite singers were not black.
Also without laws or pressure.
A relaxed society is one in which every part of it with gratitude - with gratitude of those who were happy savings by chance - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent with temperament and constitution were well suited for entertainment and athletics, singing and running.
People from the Indian subcontinent, like nature-driven electronics, have assumed responsibility for not having a family without a functional phone.
The Poles left behind were the installers, the Greeks left, washed the dishes.
Those of the Persian Gulf and Levant states, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, while it was what happened, when it happened - they were afraid to blame them for putting them in the fire, in fact, they were afraid that the fire was not going to burn them, and the next time they were going to burn them, they were going to burn them.
Everybody according to their talent.
Since she listened only to ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how the simple words that Kavern had just sung to her could make music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really loose," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden provided an illusion of security.
A word could not escape outside the soundproof sheets.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he hesitated to put two fingers to his mouth again in her presence.
You already thought he was weird.
“It seemed funny,” he said in the end.
She shook her head incredulously and blurted Kevern’s view.
There was nothing else to be seen in the whole world except the rubbish of her velvety hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you think so," she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really pissed.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
She didn't walk at all.
Maybe some ankles...
You're saying you hate me because I have too big ankles?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you" to her, but it was too early.
“Your thick ankles are just attracting me,” he tried.
I'm a little biased.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often put him in trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the charm necessary to be able to crush the cruelty that was in his jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel intentionally.
Maybe the Cavern was deliberately cruel.
In spite of my kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons shrugged and got up from the bed, picked up the radio, and poured out the unsweetened wine.
Wine without zinc, so drinking could not be for it.
She seemed to tremble in her agitation like palm leaves in a storm.
"I'm totally attracted to being an idiot," she said.
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her unpleasant words and for the fear she had in her eyes at the time she stood up against him.
You thought she'd be kicked?
She didn’t talk to him about life on the cold northern hemisphere where she grew up, but she didn’t doubt that it was basically the same as here.
The same wide and ice-cold ocean shook over them.
The same confusion of men, then, what has become, even more reckless and resentful than their predecessors, smugglers and smugglers, furiously bloomed from house to house, ready to stretch out their hand on any woman who would dare to refuse or refuse them.
Idiot?
If she doesn't pay attention, they'll show her their fingers!
First to anoint her - to anoint herself became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antidote to the soft ballads of love that radio roared - first to anoint her, then to kill her one.
In Kever’s view, too much cultivation, because rape itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons implied him nonverbally to leave.
He got up from his bed like an old man.
She felt frozen, but the weight of her sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave – as if watching him from the window on the ground floor – the man he had picked up what he had caused himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart was swollen for him and for all the men in general, no matter how many of them fell to her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders swollen, embarrassed, defeated, all the fighting left him—why did it seem to her that she knew this look well, even though she could not equip herself for a single moment until today, if she had ever seen it?
Ailinn Solomons, once again, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic twenty-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, the non-statistical monitoring system of Public mood, has prepared a short article on the persistence of the most light and medium-sized, the most powerful, the most powerful, the most powerful and the most powerful.
“A lot has been done, and a lot has to be done,” she wrote, “to calm the innate aggression of people who fought in many battles, and most of them won, especially in the deserted, hard-to-reach areas of the land, where people’s livelihoods have gone from the tops of the hills to the tops of the hills.”
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It may seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the puddles.
The inhabitants breathe over the sentimental ballads, hurl unhappy stories, and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas, old brutality holds up as hard as in urban agglomerations, sports, and domestic violence, but that it proves it.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too maiden-style," her boss said.
I would suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum leaned her head.
I have to ask myself, are you an atheist?
“I feel like I don’t have to answer that,” Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
We have re-established our right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
“I don’t ask,” said Rabinowitz, “that I should have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We have no prejudice at this workplace.
We serve an unrelated company.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is completely acceptable and praiseworthy, can sometimes distort judgment as you have shown it.
Obviously, you yourself are inclined towards the Church – things you call “crude” and “brutal” could also be interpreted as an expression of natural force and energy.
To continue to solve what has happened, WHEN it has happened, as if it had happened, yesterday, preparing the earth with its basic vital force.
While Rabinowitz was talking, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head on the light table flashed a pink recommendation that Ofnow had sent to the world for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
It is better to speak than to keep silence; a songed word is better than a written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I fully understand your reservations," replied Esme Nussbaum, quietly, as she was sure that her superior was finished, "and I no longer say that the wound did not heal as we pretend to have healed.
My concern, above all, is that if we are not warned in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what happened, WHEN it happened.
This time, however, we will not vent anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz put his fingertips together.
It should have meant infinite patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “when you describe the steps that your grandparents may and may not have made as mistakes.
You’re too far away from talking about venting your “strength” and “distrust” to “others.”
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and protecting the present we are not talking about “us” and “us.”
There were no “we” and there were no “them.”
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
“In the course of which, if we are honest with each other,” Esme took courage, “no one is innocent.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was fair or not what happened, it happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add to - we agree on this together.
And just as there is no guilt that would be put on someone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the correction was appropriate and possible.
But what is the past for, other than to learn from it--
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If there's anything I can add to that--
Luther Rabinowitz broke his fingertips.
"I'll take your report into account," he said and let it go.
The day after she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hired her on a pedestrian in a way that they described as "brutal and angry."
Coincidences happen.
The Army of the Kingdom of Lesotho says no coup plans - Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers from the Kingdom of Lesotho have denied organizing a coup to overthrow the government, claiming to have acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and said the army had surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
After declaring that he was threatened with death, the Prime Minister and his family went to the neighboring South African Republic.
Army spokesman Major Ntle Ntoi said it was not actually a coup, but the army’s response to the threat of “political fanatics” that police were trying to disarm.
"This morning, the command of the defense units of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after receiving several reports from the intelligence service that there are several groups in the police ranks that are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were going to make them in the country," he said.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has declared that the government has seized power by force, the actions of the Forest Defence Forces seem to bear the mark of a coup d'état," he said.
Military officials of the Kingdom of Lesotho said the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and there was peace in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjo Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said in his view that it is the target of the attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to internal disputes, tensions have prevailed in Lesotho.
He said that despite the opposite allegations, he did not undermine his government's actions.
Production in the euro area is at a 13-month minimum
Production growth slowed to a minimum of thirteen months, according to a carefully monitored survey in August in the euro area.
The final index of purchasing managers in the euro area (PMI) fell from June 51.8 in August to 50.7.
A number greater than 50 is an expansion.
New orders were placed and the factory was damaged by rising tensions between the EU and Russia due to Ukraine.
The figures come from the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the euro area’s remote recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB director Mario Draghi may have suggested this week that he is considering quantitative releasing the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom and the United States were accustomed to during the financial crisis.
“While at least some growth is better than any growth, the brake effect of the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is increasingly visible,” said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
Germany’s manufacturing PMI, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to a minimum of 51.4 months.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has again moved from expansion to stagnation.
Signs of a disappearance of the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands are also not very reassuring,” Dobson said.
Industry slowdowns are likely to fuel analysts awaiting the implementation of additional monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the production overview of purchasing managers in August is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “Producers in the eurozone are currently living a very complex life because the increasing geopolitical tensions – especially between Russia and Ukraine – add even more uncertainty to the increasingly demanding conditions in many countries.
This growing uncertainty has clearly affected the trade - and especially the confidence of consumers, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even canceled, especially those costly.
He said it was “even more likely” that the ECB would eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative releasing, “although we expect it to be only limited.”
10 Years of Hell of Beslan Survivors: 10 Years of Horrors from Occupied School Children Still Suffer
Ten years ago, 1,000 people were held hostage by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
During the suffering that lasted three days and shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death during the school mob.
Exactly 10 years after the terrifying occupation of a school in Beslan, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, last night, survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it seemed like the deepest depth of hell.
The resistance to the tragedy was linked by the East and the West, which in this catastrophic disaster led to action and the future.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan, in southern Russia, to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the school mob.
We have found amazing young people who have endured disasters, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists in them will live on.
What is their greatest wish?
So that the war that is now destroying Ukraine – and in which children are dying as they were – is over.
Girl trying to get back in the ruined school gymnasium
It was captured by Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov as he attempted to get back into the school gym after a bomb exploded in his underwear.
Confused Aida was desperately looking for her mother Larissa, who is now 40.
They feared they were both dead, but they actually survived.
“Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
I had legs from blood.
I got up and pulled back to find my mom.
She was rescued by a soldier.
After a few surgeries, she thought she had recovered completely, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm going to have another operation.
There were a few sparks left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people the way doctors helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn’t destroy it,” she said decisively.
“It just happened to me and it can’t change.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to friends about it.
This pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Jer Gapoev was killed there.
As a child, we played together and imagined how we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten about her arrest, but every year the memories are a little blurry.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture on the Internet, lying down the school window, I think that a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster, and prevent it from repeating itself.
A boy who escaped with rain bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia children start school at the age of seven) and he survived the three-day school siege in the hug of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, “My mother told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the ground and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
He was afraid she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the way, he grabbed the child by the hand and ran with a shower of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, “Damir told me his mother is dead.”
She said, “I couldn’t save her.”
In fact, Tamara was on her way to freedom, lying in the hospital with her wounded leg, and on the contrary, she thought her son was dead.
After seeing each other again, she said, “I was crying with luck.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the disappeared News of the World), where then-premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie were declared winners of Bernardo's Children.
“The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it,” he said.
But I can say that the memories are fading.
I remember right after that I dropped all my guns to play.
But today I can play computer games in which he shoots, and I have no problem with that.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard and they didn't get out.
We'll never say they killed them or they died.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember well on my trip to London, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted in the toy shop, and how I used to ride a convertible.
Now, however, he is concerned about places like Ukraine, where he suffers as much as he and his friends suffer from the war.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it
“I am very sorry for anyone who has to go through such a horror,” said Damir, who took part in volunteering at the monastery last week.
I want a lot of help.
One day I want to work for the police and hopefully I will be accepted to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, there were no kids screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
She remembers the trip with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even though it’s been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember how Damir had a taste for bor<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>, and so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot them with a water gun, and they ran and played with him.
And it's only been a month since that horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world hasn’t changed for the better in ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been and will be killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something in the news that they listen to when bored or while doing something else.
I know what these people are experiencing, what horror it is.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a nice and quiet boy from him, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care at all.
I know she doesn't like to remember it, but she's very close to six colleagues and she goes to the gym from time to time and lights candles there.
When he was younger, he had problems with it - I remember how he sometimes lay on a couch with a face away from us and sometimes lay for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember he threw all his guns or other weapons in the game. Damir is 17 today, he's taller than me, nice, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I woke up after the explosion and stood on my feet, I looked around and saw hell, there were pieces of human bodies everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
“I remember screaming, ‘Damire, run, run!’ but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives are different from the others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy whose photo taken after the attack became a symbol of terror in Beslan
Consolation: Survivor of Beslan Grigori Ilyin with his mother Fatimo after the attack in 2004, right Grigori today
When he fled for a life after a Chechen terrorist shot his comrades, there was a fear thrown into his bloody face.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of the monster in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, put him on his first day at school and hurried to take her eldest son Vladimir to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the court, so my boy stayed there for three days alone,” she recalled.
Not entirely alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Gregory survived.
As the date approaches, it becomes more and more difficult to think and talk about it.
Not a single day will pass before we remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem to us that it's happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are always coming back to me.
I promise that no one will ever forget.
Constantly returning memories: Photo of Grigorie (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was illuminated as a statue (right)
I remember the day when Grigori was so excited to go to school, he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
That he's alive, I found out when I saw him on TV.
There is even a statue of Grigori crying in San Marino.
Gregory doesn't like to look at this picture and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I understand that, but I also think that with this picture, people all over the world know what pain we feel.
Today, Grigori says, “It is important that this does not happen again.
“I doubt we’ll ever find out the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they're investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what was the cause?
This world awaits something very bad.
“I don’t understand why it’s happening, because when you ask people, no one wants war, so how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To at least forget a little, it takes decades.
It had an impact on my health, I still feel it.
I was three or four years old because of a nightmare attack, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was frightened every day.
I was thinking of my friends and colleagues who killed me.
So when September 1st is approaching, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is the past.
I won't forget that, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
This year I graduated from school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiac surgeon.
First, I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't work.
Grogorij Fariyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being held at the foot of a murderous terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farinev was held at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the attack, yet he managed to survive
When the attack was in full force, he was captured trapped in the gym sitting next to the bomb at the foot of the assassin terrorist.
It's a real miracle that he survived.
“It seems to us as if it was yesterday,” Gregory said, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service agent, but could not because of the injuries he suffered during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I've been thinking about.
Now I'm older and it's said that children with bad experiences can cope better - I have to say, that's not true.
“In 2006 I went to a psychologist and then I was a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - it was the first and last time I got back into the gym.
I've missed it.
I'll never go there again, and don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting on that well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on a notebook with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know that I don’t like to think or talk about it, and they never ask me for it in school.
As for physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful of my knees, which I wound myself, but I'm already walking normally.
But still, because of my health, I couldn’t attend and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they told me that this was not possible.
My other favorite are animals, so I went to the veterinarian.
I finished the second year there.
They learn how to treat all animals from “cats to cows”.
He said, “I know I will never tell my children about it.
It’s not something children should know about, and it’s not something they should experience at all.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “This pain will always be here.
It's inside, and it's getting worse with the anniversary approaching.
I will attend the commemorative ceremonies.
I know Grigori won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregory is an adult today, but the horror continues.
It’s hard to accept when something so terrible happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He has undergone several operations, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say that 50 percent have already overcome the horror, but to overcome it completely and forget it can't.
This terrible experience with us will always be.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors were killed and the pain only worsens.
I lost a lot of people that I loved and that were close to me.
My son is with me and this is the greatest gift that God could have given me, but I suffer the loss of the dead.
I know families in which other children were born, but also widows who have not remarried.
It’s hard to assume that life goes on even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him at the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world - wars elsewhere.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed.
If we could take all the rebels and throw them away... as far as possible.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The child who brought a special command to safety
Saved: Alyon Tskaev is taken to the safe Russian special command (left).
Now she is ten (right) and she does not remember the tragedy at all.
The world was caught breathing in 2004 when a Russian policeman took the little Alyon out of the Belgian detention.
The terrorists released her, but kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristin and her brother Makhara in the school gym.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and they have a daughter named Kristina after her deceased daughter, Svetlana.
Neighbors say that Alyona, now ten, does not remember the attack at all, and she grew up with a clever and happy little girl.
A close friend said, “It’s a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids.”
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep children away from memories that remind us of the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.

4 tips on how to get better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in shooting or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is a compact such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera like the GoPro Hero3<0x2B> Silver Edition, which costs around <0x24>300.
I took these photos at a family celebration with a few cameras, all costing less than <0x24>350.
It doesn’t matter what equipment you use, but there are a few rules to achieve the best results.
Check out the equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
Next, set the camera according to the type of photos or videos you will take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a stage or shooting mode that optimizes exposure to a dark underwater environment.
And before you get into it, find out how deeply you can dive into your equipment.
Some cameras are designed for only 5 feet, others for 50 to 60 feet.
Read our guide on the purchase and evaluation of digital cameras in both standard and waterproof designs.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them won't come out.
Compact cameras have an LCD that will help you with the composition of photos, but outdoors do not have it.
Even if you have an LCD, underwater will be poorly seen and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So, always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with slightly different exposure dispersion, use it.
Stay close to the level.
With a deeper immersion, the light decreases dramatically.
If possible, stay close to the level when shooting in the pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to capture more light in photos - the deeper you sink, the fewer colors you will see.
Get close to the photographed object.
This is great advice if you are photographing on land, but under water is even more important because of darker light.
This is especially important when shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a solid and wide angle of the lens, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose personality strength was able to change things even in a huge organization like the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to relieving patients from pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of the torture that froze him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disease, treated patients in the vast majority are interested in something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was he who began to suffer.
“I don’t feel in my skin,” he wrote in May of that year.
I felt powerless.
He struggled with the flu symptoms and found that he was impatient and his wife Juliet included rashes.
He said, “I want everything to be done sooner than later.”
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
There's something wrong.
A colleague made an X-ray of his chest.
He skied in the French Alps two weeks earlier.
X-ray results have arrived.
He had mesotelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the spinal cord or lung excretion.
For most types of cancer, it is difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
The mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, it is the cause of exposure to asbestos - a building fiber material that was formerly called "miracle", but today it is known to be deadly.
For most of us, it was not a difficult mesotelioma to ignore.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into force.
Even at the time when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, for example, insulation shearers, builders, carpenters and workers in shipyards.
Toxins used in the industry in another era today are hardly seen as a cause for concern.
Such selfishness is not in place.
As it turns out, a mesothelioma epidemic peaks in Britain today.
The number of mesothelioma deaths here is higher than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths to this disease per year is twice as many as the number of fatalities in car accidents.
Number of mesothelioma deaths per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason why we only feel its effects right now, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were finally banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades to develop mesotelioma.
The disaster in the form of mesotelioma does not concern only the veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases is still, present in the homes where we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops where we shop.
The mesothelioma therefore does not respect the social layer, wealth, profession or age.
Privileged gardens from London business houses to public schools are no hiding place.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals where we should be treated are the repository of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He didn't even believe in isolation.
He was trying to find out where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
“It’s possible that a lot of asbestos was in the underground corridors of Guy’s Hospital, where I spent six years practicing,” he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - used corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question he was able to answer in part.
“Of the four doctors who were at Guy’s Hospital and who had mesothelioma in the last five years,” he wrote in a letter in 2010, “I’m the only one still alive.”
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, he was 55 years old.
Surviving this diagnosis for so long is not common.
55% of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of being diagnosed.
The disease is always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us are sick with the same disease?”
According to leading British expert on the mesothelioma of Professor Julian Pet, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic takes place in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Nowadays, most of them have no idea that they will die in this way.
Asbestos Mine in Quebec, Canada
A regular look at the records from the court archives, to which the disabilities often turn and require compensation, shows how much the mesoteliomic disaster has spread.
Marks & Spencer, for example, admitted in June that it exhibited asbestos to Janice Allen.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised two clothing stores - one of the locations was the company's flagship, a store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today he has two children who are over 20.
“Before it happened,” she says, “I’ve never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never thought in a dream that it would affect me in any way.
Not a lot of people know about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
It is named for its fibrous structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Three of the six minerals were used in construction.
Most often today, it is possible to find chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos in buildings.
It has been used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even brake lining.
It is not as lethal as other forms of asbestos, but the EU and WHO still consider it a “great health risk” that can cause death.
The most dangerous are brown asbestos (mosite) and blue asbestos (crokydolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts claim that "there is convincing but indirect evidence that it was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesotelioma [in the United Kingdom]."
Marsk & Spencer employees exhibited asbestos at a flagship store on Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical victim of mesothelioma, but the work of Julian Pete suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients claims that “a substantial proportion of cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
Much of this exposure is due to the “common use and ventilation” of buildings.
Looks like no one can be sure he's safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government may not have a clue that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that the service elevators and pipes behind the parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fiber of which could be broken by something as harmless as “a strong air stream.”
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case it may be the opposite of the truth.
Although the Directorate of Parliament's Services insisted on Westminster Palace getting "positive medical certificates", it is now expected that one million pounds and several years of work will be needed to be thoroughly reviewed by the Parliament for the Algerian census, to modernize the electricity industry in 2015, and to modernize the Westminster census and census.
The Goddard report says that “the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations.”
It is not possible to say whether this inconsistency will cost lives.
Everyone can just wait now.
One of the people who were never able to determine when they were exposed to asbestos was Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Just like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, is suspected of being exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was proven,” she says, “but in my case I can’t prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But he remembers the day in early December 2009, when something like a cold hit him down.
He was 45, he was in the evening, and he was just in the middle of surgery.
All of a sudden, I shook.
It came all of a sudden.
I was awful.
I didn't think I was going home by car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain originated from the spinal cord, swelling around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe that this was a mesotelioma.
He finally spent a month at home.
Confused doctors made an X-ray of his chest and introduced a thoracic catheter to remove fluid from his lungs, which they sent for examination.
They did not make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after exercising and breathing.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to the operating room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and at work got into direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor consulted his CT and X-rays with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the space between the chest cavity and the lung cavity.
I'm optimistic.
I tend not to take too much,” she says.
To be honest, I didn't worry too much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, you were worried.
The results of the biopsy came between Christmas and the New Year: “They told me it was a mesotelioma.”
Graham Abbott diagnosed with Mesothelioma
Abbott began to meet with the sisters of the Macmillan charitable organization and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in pipelines,” he says.
In people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, the disease is now beginning to manifest.
Thus, mesothelioma is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have a risky profession.
The most dangerous asbestos insulated tubes in hospitals were located in the basement, so it was unlikely that they would endanger patients.
However, staff members who passed through subterranean corridors between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in subterranean dining rooms (such as Graham Abbott often) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it turns out now, decades after the war, the hospital was a place where patients could save their lives, but also a place that could put the lives of doctors who treated them at risk.
Asbestos is removed to this day.
Students build Bunsen’s kahan on asbestos pads
It's not just about the hospital.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its excellent insulating and non-combustible properties.
In schools, too.
In fact, many people have been exposed to asbestos already in school.
Somewhere in countless hours, students of chemistry built Bunsen's cahan on an asbestos pad.
A website has been created dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools.
Innocuous items such as floor tiles or roofing tools in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison built into a large number of homes," said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesotelioma could remember was in the 1970s when she drilled a garden house.
So pay attention to how you handle the garden cottage.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is enormous.
“It takes a while for you to get it done,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found that I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't have another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient.
As an innumerable number of patients before him, he also remembers how he felt confused by the amount of information he had to deal with.
“It was hard to understand that,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have left?’
I was told it was 12 months ago.
I remember when I said, “Well, I’m not going to have another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills us.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers breathe, they can settle in the stool, lung discharge.
Asbestos fibers irritate the spinal cord and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem is inhaled asbestos fibers in the shape of needles,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac surgeon who attended Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is paradoxically the leading center in mesothelioma treatment.
Treasure Lawson also knew and treated other patients who were likely exposed to asbestos during hospital practice.
Asbestos needles get into the tissue of the lungs, Treasure says, and “breathing alone pushes them to the edge where the swelling is located.
Its character is invasive from the very beginning.
Mesothelioma does not take as much of the usual treatment options used for other types of cancer.
For example, there is a lot of discussion about the effectiveness of the operation.
Some say it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the stool," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer “does not respond too much to chemotherapy” which, although “has some effect”, does not cure.
“Sometimes someone survives lung cancer,” Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live far longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years since his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After discovering mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and counselor for equally affected people.
When they called, he was happy to introduce himself, “Good morning, you called to the cancer center.”
“It was very positive,” Abbott says.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and was still very active.
At first, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and probably only extended his life by a month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, “was able to show things in a more optimistic light.”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski of the Breast Surgery Department at Guy's Hospital.
“I had the advantage that I didn’t have to wait until I was sent to him, but I just called there and they looked at me,” admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to get the application and they would have to approve it.
In order to get the best available treatment, money is a key issue for patients with mesotelioma.
But when different treatments end up inevitably failing, many patients face further financial concerns - about the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgana of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health,” says Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we meet the negligence of the company.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually equated, but according to Morgan, it was not a "full equilibrium" because Lawson could not definitively prove that the mesothelioma was the result of asbestos exposure at Guy's Hospital.
However, after investigating the case, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that "asbestos in the incriminated subterranean part was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Cheating the exposure of deadly asbestos to one company or place of work – usually decades after that happened – proved to be a huge problem for patients with mesotelioma seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces have changed owners or collapsed.
Evidence of insurance is lost.
And those who are now prosecuted have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly do not.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation was approved this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek compensation, even if it is not possible to monitor their former employer.
The law created a <0x24>350 million financial reserve, which is paid by insurance companies and is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, disabilities will receive 80% of the amount that would normally be attributed to them by the court as compensation – about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Each year, 300 applications are expected to be successfully processed.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelioma, believes that 350 million pounds is “good work.”
“It’s an agreement written by the insurers for the insurance companies,” he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what the insurers would have to pay if the time did not fall and people with mesothelioma would be able to find former employers and normalize them.
Even Mike Penning, the former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law “had gaps.”
But Penning and Morgan admit that due to the seven deaths each year, quick action was needed.
“People are suffering too much and they need help right away,” Penning said during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Act in December last year.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdun for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasury, he thought had a positive effect.
After the operation, radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed - a triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski can boast a five-year survival rate in up to 40% of patients.
Abbott reinforced it.
“Of course, that’s not the most important thing,” Abbott says.
You still see it in patients.
There's something that drives you.
When you give up, your condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
The check-ups showed no symptoms of the disease.
I went to another check-up in March [2014].
I had a few spots [cancers] in my chest.
My fiftieth birthday is approaching.
It's not life-threatening.
Take it.
Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy again.
Currently, there are no traces of tumors in his body.
It is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about the practical things - about financial security when I die, or about showing a woman how a boiler alarm works.
When you hear the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
Like Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it’s not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition means I'll never be old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends and all of a sudden a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more resilient.
She didn't say much.
Such interviews must be faced by all cancer patients.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not relieved by hope or merely a sign of a chance of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brings Stephen Jay Gould) unpleasant certainty.
As Andrew Morgan said, “It does not endanger life for the poor.”

China refuses to give Hong Kong power to choose leadership – protesters promise revenge
The Chinese parliament on Sunday refused to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election despite growing debates over democratic reform.
It is likely that this move will spark long-promised protests in the Hong Kong business district, as the activists began to organize and prepare just hours after this announcement.
China’s People’s Congress essentially allows communist leaders to exclude any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
“We weren’t surprised, but we were upset,” said Emily Lau, the Democratic Party’s president.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong lie.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
To defend China's decision, Deputy Secretary-General of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress Li Fei said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's leadership elections would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom returned China to Hong Kong, Beijing has promised that from 2017 onwards its people will be able to vote for executive power.
China’s leaders presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong is allowing direct voting, but the decision also makes it clear that China’s leaders are holding firmly in their hands the nomination process of a committee that is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded one of the biggest and most watched protests in Hong Kong in several years.
The majority of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong stand behind the Occupation Center movement with love and peace, whose organizers threatened to close the financial district if Beijing did not grant them general voting rights.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupation movement gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement is entering a new stage of civil disobedience and that waves of protests will begin in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement "considered the occupying of the Central only as a last step if all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and no other choice is made.
We must announce with regret that today all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the occupation of the Central is inevitable.
Officials in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement all day and on Sunday strengthened the protection of government headquarters and deployed police and barricades.
Stimulating riots is, according to many Hong Kongers, a sign that they are slowly losing control of the city.
The arrival of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of products and services.
There is also growing concern that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are bent with increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Central Occupation Movement and say their demonstrations are threatening the trade – the Hong Kong rescue boat.
“The protest they’re talking about could cause much more economic damage depending on how many people are involved and for how long,” says politician Regina Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We do not want the fear of Hong Kong getting out of control.
Such perceptions could damage investments.
China’s state media has also in recent days come up with reports depicting democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by the West.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which attracted 780,000 voters – more than a fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
Pre-election Agitka?
The League in Jihlava is named after the political movement
In the regional town of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, there are approximately 1,600 amateur athletes playing a small dungeon.
And their highest competition is renamed Together for the Jihlava League.
It was named after one of the movements that went to the October municipal elections.
In addition, the tenth of his candidate is Jan Mráka, a small dig in Jihlava.
"There was a general assembly where there was no problem with that," Mrak said.
The situation around the first league of small diggers was already handled by the lawyers of the Jihlava City Council and recommended to change the system of distribution of grants.
Last year, the small mining site of the city received about a million crowns.
This year, it is worth hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure is not small digging in contravention of either the law or the directives of the magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for the allocation of grants and grants," said spokesman for the magistrate Radek Tulis.
Taking subsidy from the city and at the same time expressing as a little digging support in the elections of one political party, it probably won’t work anymore.
A similar demand from politicians has not yet been made on high-level "big" football.
That the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD regional intersection, ODS division or KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL 1 might have been formed.
What about class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be in favor.
On the contrary, I would like to be contacted by sponsors from a number of companies," said Miroslav Vrzá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, president of the regional football association.
The head of the small football of the other side and the movement in the name of the league will not leave
According to the players, small diggers in Jihlava would deserve this sport to own an area with six playgrounds, dressing rooms and social facilities.
"For example, the playground in Na Stoupách is not ours, we are rented there," said Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Lape<0xC5><0xA1> from Starlet Jihlava.
The most suitable location would be the Czech mill.
But there will be, in my opinion, a nonsensical terrain for skaters, who are about fifty in Jihlava," Mráka warned.
Mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vyzazal (ODS) responded that a small excavator uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Ro<0xC5><0xA1>ické and Na Stoupách, which are owned by the city.
We want to build playgrounds that have the maximum use.
We are going to modernize or build sports grounds at schools, which will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think there has been a huge progress in the last few years for the small digging,” he added.
Other political parties in the league titles will not appear, according to Jan Mráka.
We have limitations.
If someone from one sector enters into a partnership with us, we don’t give the other there anymore,” he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league is at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Voldán, a member of the Sports Council.
"But whether the voters will assess whether Mr. Mráka is using the Little Drowned Jihlava Association and the city's grants for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition breaks into university life - the first to fly a jet plane
We are happy to be able to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in the UK.
In order to give the best impression when arriving at the university, the company also offers transportation options including a private syringe or cars such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also said that the service also has its own security side.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to train their stuff across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
With our VIF (very important fresher) variants this year, we are looking forward to ensuring that students arrive at the university with minimal nervousness and maximum luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that as the services have just started, they have no bookings yet, but added: “Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks.”
The company also said that although students pay an annual tuition of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today’s students are different in terms of expectations and desires – it’s more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve it.
The National Union of Students, however, criticized the service as unavailable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, said: “For most students, such a project is inaccessible.
Many students who attend university this month must face a financial crisis before they throw thousands of pounds for something as simple as getting to college, because available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with rising costs.
Feminists fight against racism and police behavior after Ferguson events
Earlier this month, an unarmed young man was killed by a policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
Attendees waiting for the funeral with their hands up: "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the shooting of unarmed young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noted a shift in online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer sex to race.
With the rising tension in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the nationwide press, Perez noted that the reaction of the whites is 100% concentrated on the race.
Compared to the reactions of blacks shortly after the August 9 shooting, personal articles with titles such as "the idea of whites over Ferguson" or "feminism is not just about suppressing women" appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, this is an important change.
“I think there aren’t a lot of people in the feminist movement who would talk about race and privilege at this level,” she said.
People felt that what had happened had to be expressed.
This is characteristic of the crisis we are facing, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially defended that they had to warn it.
According to a professor of English at Ohio State University, Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson highlighted the problems that African-Americans face every day and that are not perceived as “women’s issues” in the cultural sphere.
“I can post funny life stories on Facebook with my partner and get 150 characters from people from all over the world,” Mitchell said.
When I write something about the colors being trapped in their own country, it's a shameless silence.
“How is it possible that a woman can talk publicly about relationships, but not about safety in public spaces?” she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, who have dealt with race, gender, and sexuality issues in American history, there is no difference between race and gender issues of dichotomy.
In her opinion, black women could not afford luxury to clearly divide these problems: they live every day in this mixed reality.
Although white women today combine race and gender issues in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s question and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessor did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched and the reason for the rape of whites was almost all cases,” said Hattery.
To justify the lynching, you needed the cooperation of the whites.
According to Hattery, the split between whites and blacks came when campaigners like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or blacks - could have the right to vote.
“They decided to bet cards on the right to vote for women and the right to focus on blacks later,” said Hattery.
When we realize this, we'll get an important insight into why colored women don't believe whites.
We didn't do a good job.
We've never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for them to start organizing against lynching in the Association of Southern Women to Prevent lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after the Blacks first told themselves about the help.
According to Mitchell, the rise of white feminists’ reactions to questions brought about in Ferguson—the question of police behaviour, racial discrimination—reflects the time when white feminists had to “follow” the questions that black women faced for generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if activists in these areas [of traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?”
The second wave of feminists, who have made a career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraception, now find out what that means.
Major feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown by a Facebook attack, where they published a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian, which demanded that white Americans protest more vigorously against racism.
“I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society – and racial opinions that differ significantly in public opinion polls – will strive for change,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates intersectional feminism, which includes questions of race and gender, her comments on the issue of race in America are confused by some people.
Expert at the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of “Who Stole Feminism?”, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are “much more vulnerable than their sisters,” but notes by Steinen’s side that Ferguson faces.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program called My Brother's Keeper, which was intended to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it triggered a furious reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police’s relationship with the Black community is not the only problem that comes at the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. Border Police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied youth in the country this year, the issue of immigration law reform once again raised – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercadová, co-chair of We Belong Together, a women’s movement to reform immigration laws, said that in order to be able to present the question as a necessary issue for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
“They speak for themselves,” says Mercado.
Because most of the work permits are granted to men, women who come with them find themselves in a position when they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
“These stories have a reputation in women’s organizations,” she said.
Pig residence in Ipswich for sale
The real estate office removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, a pig rested on it in the living room.
One-bedroom detached house, which is for sale for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
Information photographs included a picture of the living room in which he rests with his head on a pig's couch.
Connells real estate agency said that the pig in the photo is the pet of the owners.
“The footage was mistaken there, and therefore it has already been removed,” a spokesman told the office.
In the property information, the Connells real estate office described the former prayer hall as "a separate one-bedroom house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social networks, where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey in the southwest has a fresh millionaire
The lottery player in Harvey will win a million.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in southeast Perth, one lucky man will take <0x24>1.1 million from Saturday's lottery draw home.
Traffic in Harvey was the second time in five years, the last time it was a <0x24>1 million win in November 2009.
However, the winner only has to sign up.
Store owner Steve Forward said the whole town in southwestern Perth was talking about winning.
This is the main topic and everyone is upset.
We thought a similar win was a touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia won a single win last month, ending a couple of happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player at Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires and just a few weeks earlier in Belmont won an incredible <0x24>7.5 million.
The winning couple had been betting for twenty years and said that the win would allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of <0x24>85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains will not leave in the evening.
Engineers want higher salaries.
In a press release, the GDL called the protest a warning strike, for which it approvedly chose time outside the traffic tip.
At the selected time of the strike, the GDL takes into account many people who return to the railroad from the weekend until the first working day.
At the same time, we also think of people who go to work during the day," the union said in a press release on Monday morning to declare the strike.
"Our first strike should affect primarily freight transport, less passengers," GDL added.
The DB has not yet published an official response to the strike announcement.
It is also unclear how the protests will affect international railway connections, among others with the Czech Republic.
Trade unions are calling for a five percent increase in drivers’ wages and a two-hour reduction in working hours per week.
Currently, the average salary of drivers varies from 36,000 to 46,000 euros (998,000 to 1.27 million kroner) per year, depending on the years worked.
Engineers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DBs refuse to accede to wage increases by shortening working hours.
At the same time, they stress that the salary assessments of drivers must be developed as well as that of other railway personnel, for whom the DB does not count as a shortening of the working week.
There was a threat that Krist's car would start to burn.
That's why the Barum rally is over.
What exactly happened?
It was a defective material.
The car was completely new, so I didn’t even think something like that could happen.
Was the exhaust not temporarily repaired and continued at a slower rate to the service, where the mechanic would replace it?
If we were to go straight there, yes.
But we had two more erections waiting and it didn’t work out.
There is a high temperature in it and the risk of the car starting to burn was great.
I can't afford that.
At full speed, you've been able to pass five speed tests.
Which one of them did you feel?
Very good.
I felt like a young man.
We were fast, but I didn't win.
All of this was due to the fact that we’ve dumped the car for more than half a year to be at some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You broke it so that you could really think of winning.
I made myself and the car so that we really had to win.
The job didn't come in.
On the other hand, the result that we could think about did not come.
But that's Barumka.
The technician said no.
You weren't the only one of the tip that retired prematurely from the championship fight.
His favourites were Breen, Abbring and Lappi.
Are you surprised that so many favorites have resigned?
Yes, I do.
It was a pity, especially for the audience, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus has been on the tip for a long time, which you are about to drive.
But he paid to get out of the line and picked up a nearly two-minute shortage.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's a shame, because he could repeat the stages of the winners.
After all, he went the first two times.
But Mira also confirmed that we prepared the car well.
He went very fast.
Just a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you showed up at the start of the Barum rally.
Can you feel good about driving again to become a regular participant in rally races?
Definitely not at the moment.
Last year I said that Barumka was my last race and I didn’t keep it.
I decided to take her back.
It was my nineteenth start here, and if there's a chance in a year, I'll probably go into it.
But I'm not thinking about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just because of you.
Did it please you?
To a certain extent, it was because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, were constantly asking if they would go.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barum?
That's going on.
Next week we will go to Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
In addition to this race, he wants to borrow from us the fable of Honza Sykora.
With Miru, we will have a European doubles event in Switzerland and Corsica.
We'll have to get things ready for next year.
Is there anything you can suggest?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsican Rally was part of the World Championships, you reached the fifth place in the series.
Aren't you excited to try the trail again?
Don't be afraid.
Oral agreement with an employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you are not allowed to issue a medical certificate of incapacity that serves as proof for the organization that you are unable to perform work duties for health reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify the employer of the absence.
While it was subsequently agreed that those days would be recorded as holidays, the agreement was only oral.
Although the Labour Code does not have an obligation to confirm the consent of the employer to take the leave in writing, in practice this procedure has been proven.
If there is only an oral hearing, you do not have a confirmation of the agreement.
Subsequently, the alleged consent to take a leave, as in your case, may be deemed to be refused and absent from work as a long-term unexcused absence, hence the reason for the immediate termination of the employment relationship according to <0xC2><0xA7> 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a legal dispute with the employer, you will be lacking evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been cancelled in accordance with <0xC2><0xA7> 53, you only have those days listed in the financial statement as an unforgivable absence.
An unexcused absence in the financial statement does not have the same consequences as <0xC2><0xA7> 53 (e.g., the impossibility of obtaining material unemployment insurance), but this makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you re-visit the doctor and let yourself in writing confirm that there was actually an accident, as a result of which you were unable to work (it is not a so-called "incompetence", it is only a doctor's document).
If you are looking for a new job, you can submit the above-mentioned document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the issuance of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, the early notification to the employer or the request for written consent to taking a leave.
This way, you can avoid possible complications.
Tony Stewart's accident when he returned to the track
Tony Stewart’s return to the track ended just halfway through the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the playground for the second time after his right front tyre crashed in the 172nd round, and the race for him was over.
Stewart took the damaged car into the garage, didn't show up to reporters and left.
His team boss Chad Johnston said the 14th car team is disappointed, but will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, next weekend.
“I would like to have a better performance and a better conclusion,” Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and we're hoping there's more to be done.
Stewart crashed into the playoffs for the first time in a Sunday evening race after a collision with Kyle Bush, demanding a right-hand side repair of his car.
"We put hope in today's race for a good finish," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart’s car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York City, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the Atlanta race or the next race in Richmond to take the place in the table.
He returned to the race during an investigation into a tragic accident in which 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who took Stewart on the road, died.
Authorities said the investigation into the cause of the accident would take at least another two weeks.
So far, it has not been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
A three-time champion was warmly encouraged before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the start of the race he worked on 10th, and then even 4th.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, Busch's car no.
18 got out of control, went out of the second lap and hit Stewart, sending both cars to play.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st place.
Prague chooses new taxi station manager, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection process for the new taxi service operator.
For 103 parking spaces, it will earn approximately 12.3 million kroner a year.
Until recently, the same places for taxi drivers have collected <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 a year.
This was reported by Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Manhart (TOP 09).
In the past, the city used lottery when selecting administrators.
The winner then got the rent for a fixed amount of 1000 kroner per year.
But the rules have changed.
Currently, the higher bid is decided.
"A year after the cancellation of the original lease agreements and the initiation of the tendering procedures, it has proved that the new lease system is far more advantageous and overall fair for Prague," says the councillor.
The most expensive spot is Na Per<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>na
The highest price offered by visitors for a place in Na Per<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n<0xC4><0x9B> street.
He will pay 2.1 million kroner a year.
Approximately 1.5 million SEK have been paid by the new administrators for the seats in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for the leasing of taxi stations were adopted by the council in the fall of 2012 and cancelled the original leasing contracts in the summer of last year.
The selection process took place in four waves and the new administrator found 29 seats.
For the second time this year, we had to clean the well.
We released it all the time, creating practically a second pond around the cottage.
Then we put Savo there.
Unbelievable punch!
Our well in the basement always had enough scented water.
And it wasn't a professionally crafted pig, Grandpa stabbed her with self-help.
A long time ago.
She was only on three turns and totally unique, like everything else in the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Up to the airfield.
When we started the season, of course, we exhausted the water.
When she was there for a number of months, she deserved it.
But then again, we thought the water didn’t smell.
We were wondering if there was anything wrong.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible with a little bit of dirt, there the board did not quite stand, so the opening was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
There was nothing else in the water, and we lighted it up to the bottom.
So we released it again and cleaned it up.
Of course, we have improved the improvised sealing around the pump pipe.
We noticed strange things in the basement.
There was a slick packet on the ground with some bones.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further.
Now it looked like an octopus mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where there are ducts, grandfather's invention, there were fish remains!
It's hard to eat!
Our basement is also unique.
Some would say that Grandpa briefly buried the cottage.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
Walls and floors are only suffocated sand, only the ceiling is submerged.
There are mainly ships.
A car.
The bed on the beach.
The door with wide gaps was usually open, as someone walked there in one piece.
At the ceiling of several of the already mentioned passages.
Without a net, so there are usually birds flying there and they build a nest on the ropes.
It is unnecessary to mention the mice.
Grandpa wanted it to blow up, and that's it again.
But the air didn’t help either.
The whole cellar stinks.
We also cleaned the entire basement.
Especially the fish on the beam was nourishing!
We also threw away things around: boards, herald boards, and so on.
Our long-distance cottage welcomed the surrounding disinfection team.
We've been wondering who could have put those ugly remains there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometres from here in all.
She'd be hard to come to us.
My grandfather was attacked by a neighbor who is not quite well.
What if that Frenchman didn't blow us the dirt out of there?
He's been here practically all year, stupid ideas, that's what he has.
We decided to watch the basement and the well and check regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far only to wash and wash before the tests are finished, but it was good already.
Pulling water out of a wooded sink is nothing I would like to do for a long time.
We once heard a terrifying scary whistle of our feathers.
My mother looked from the balcony and saw a long strong black hose in the grass next to the veranda.
Reza whispered over her and pissed like crazy.
My mom invented it because she thought Réza had dug a waste hose out of the sink.
All of a sudden, however, the hose partly flew into the club and partly straightened.
There was a fire in the balcony.
Reza had a hysterical seizure.
We ran downstairs.
The skull, long over a meter and as thick as a bull, was about to swallow a huge skull, and Réza was defending her.
It was unclear whether she wanted to save the robbery or whether she wanted to eat it on her own, but that was irrelevant.
When she saw the force in the form of our whole family, she probably thought we should eat it when we were so warm, and she slipped elegantly into the basement.
We flew behind her.
Like a flash jumping to the well.
By the way, we've recorded another scented package on her board.
Smells like a fish.
She wasn't there last night!
Our new security around the pump was a bit shy.
We closed the cellar all day long.
I'd like to...
We went out and there we all went to one pass.
We didn't wait long.
It's fucked up behind the well.
First, there was a flat head with yellow moons on the neck.
Then the whole tape slipped into the well.
She wrestled around the pump and began to dig in.
An extorted employee took revenge, bought laptops at the firm and sold them.
After his release, a green employee bought a computer company and then sold it.
The money was spent before the police were detained.
In a short time, the man bought in twelve cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"He took the notebooks to Olomouc after taking over, where he sold them at the bazaars," said Chief Commissioner Rostislav Brückner.
The motive for fraud was to pay the employers for letting go and also to make money.
“In our hearing, he claimed that he used the money to pay off the loans,” Brückner said.
Police also found the scammer to be a pathological player who has been repeatedly treated in psychiatry.
Thus, the money could also end up in winning machines or in video lottery terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money with him," said the Commissioner.
A fraudster, who was once convicted of theft, is now in danger of being held in prison for a period of one year to five years.
Police have not yet announced whether the penalty is also threatening to the bazaars that have bought laptops at a lower price and continue to sell them.
"It is true that they have taken over entirely new goods, which is at least suspicious," the Commissioner said.
None of the bazaar owners have yet been charged.
Come on, a little more, you'll do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have made a few changes.
The biggest change was the route that brought the target to the pool, instead of taking it back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a bit from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers on the stand, where we took photos and filmed videos together.
In order to reach perfection my view from the other side, I took on the role of a personal guide.
Just before the start, my friend and I were obediently placed at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes.
We said goodbye to the friends who walked around us in the sector for faster runs.
There's not much time left.
A couple of leaps to warm up, turn on sportstesters, countdown and start!
The screams of the jassot, but instead of a quick start followed a cupping to the starting line.
After five minutes, we reach the gate, turn on the measurements, and run at a rate of ten hours.
We are surrounded by the yellow snake of runners who run their first race similar to Catha.
In the meantime, everyone looks fresh, the slowly setting sun in the sky provides a view of the Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad with almost a whirlwind of hope.
The pulsating meat stretching along the coast looks like the whole of Prague is running here.
On the shore between the Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad and the National Theatre, traditionally, it begins to show who has how much power.
A light dip on Palack<0xC3><0xBD> square forces many runners to slow down or to go for a walk.
Just before I go to the Theatre, I see a police escort and immediately after it Vítek Pavli<0xC5><0xA1>ta flies at an incredible pace to the destination.
I can hear the amazing breathing of the other runners.
I'm moving to the edge of the track, encouraging him, he's about to make fun of me, but just before that, my leg is rotting and our hands are tightly mined.
Walking the Theatre Street gives you the chance to have a short rest and relaxation.
I need to have places in front of me where I can breathe.
The island on the Manes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the sunset.
I can't breathe and my legs almost carry me alone.
There are moments of truth for the first snack.
During the crossing of the road Kát<0xC4><0x9B>, the slope of the slope will be laid and the jump will be shown.
I look if she doesn't need help, and I trigger a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and we continue on Ko<0xC5><0xBE>i street, it is one of the closest places of the track, at this stage of the race there is no such rush, but it is necessary to keep a close eye on the surroundings.
I still don't know if the concept of the narrowest place will gain its true meaning later on.
Behind the Powder Gate we are freneticly encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I try to squeeze with anyone who offers a hand, and I recommend it to Kat, because 10 squeezing with fans is like half an energy bar.
Actually it's working, we're accelerating again, and although we've had quite a significant crash, now the hunting ride has begun.
We run dozens of runners, when I have someone particularly tired, I try to encourage him a few words: "Come on, a little more, you can do it!"
After the last snack, no one's ahead of us, we're accelerating.
So far we've been running for an hour and a quarter, we add, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometres to the target will hurt, but you really need to squeeze.
The sun has slowly set and the end of the day symbolically slowly ends the race.
Last run on the bridge, turn and just a straight line to the goal.
The pace we're running, I wonder where that girl's going?
"Come on, let's go under three o'clock, macaque!" I call.
We try it, we sprint, and here's the goal.
Thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
The coach set an hour limit of 20.
So seven minutes under the schedule.
Which is a great result.
Right behind the target, the cat's legs are swelling, helping her to the chin where she rests for a while.
It can be seen on it exhaustion, but also luck from a well-run performance.
After a while, I slowly take her out of the target space.
Euphoria does not make us think of a printer in the passageways to the wardrobes.
Here it can be seen that Cow Street was not the narrowest place.
That's where the target of a flood, which is under the pressure of almost 10,000 runners, is inclined to burst.
If someone doesn't like the crowd, it's not the place for him.
I also lose my mind for a moment and wonder if the wonderful views and the more interesting route compared to the previous flights were worth what is happening at the destination.
From my own experience, I know that running a race is not a joke.
If ten thousand people are added to this, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire Prague centre for all transport, this is a huge challenge.
This year’s change of route showed the runners many interesting spots, but also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped out in the Yellow Spas was transferred between the runners and in the race itself.
The organizers around the track and random spectators staged it on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, the city runs through the historic centre with obstacles that cannot be removed, but the goal of the mass race in a place that is limited on one side by the wall and on the other by the river, I do not consider the best solution.
If I say to myself that the race has ended with a goal, I consider it very successful.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but in the end everything went well.
Write to us if you liked the route and what you say about the situation in the target.
Prison guards in Bulgaria organise protests
Hundreds of prison service workers across Bulgaria took part in a national protest assembly in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the resumption of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on the list of demands to be discussed with interim Minister of Justice Christo Ivanovi.
The supervisors of the month symbolically protested against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the prison guards’ unions and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
“Negotiations are still underway,” said Rosen Zhelyazkov, Head of the General Directorate of Prison Service.
Members of the Federation of Workers’ Trade Unions are also expected to join the protests of the prison service staff at the Ministry of the Interior.
Why the universe may have more dimensions and we don't see them
Physicists don't usually write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University made a black hit in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for the lay people to penetrate into the heap of problems that a number of theoretical physicists are dealing with today - an attempt to unite two perfectly functioning but incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that the search for a unified physical theory is not a boring story.
The basic physics problem between two key theories (in fact, at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has been solved and solved in such a way that it is worth recounting and laity.
In addition, Greene consulted with the complex material so fresh and convincing that it was impossible to calculate how much interesting he did not include in his book.
In addition, he corrected his "mistake" for the most part in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Apparently even the author would not object to the fact that his book would become obsolete faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years there will be only a little bit more alive in this area (e.g. because the LHC accelerator will finally go on "full gas"), so it's a good time to enter Green's non-violently open doors of the modern world.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may sound silly, fantastic, odd, or mystical.
However, it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us for a moment turn our eyes off the universe as a whole to something more ground-based, namely the long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine pulling a stometer garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the whole scenery from a distance of half a mile (as shown in the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you can easily record a long hose stretched horizontally, but if you do not suffer from blindness right now, you will hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Given its great distance from the hose, you would think that the ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can pass: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ants were at the moment, you answer them with only one data: the distance of the ants from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a distance of half a kilometer, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose is thick.
If we enlarge everything, we suddenly see a second dimension - in the form of a circle that wraps the hose.
In this enlarged view, it is obvious that the ants can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension of the length of the hose, but also in the "dimension in/against the direction of movement of the clock handles", i.e. the circle of the snake.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small ants you need to enter two numbers: how far is it from the end of the hose and where on the circle is the winding hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (Mr. Experts will notice that this chapter focuses purely on the disruptive theory of strings.
The non-violent aspects are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is depicted by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circuit, marked by a circular arrow, is short and curved.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
The dimension of the winding circuit of the hose is short, "winded" and worse noticeable.
To realize the existence of the circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with much better resolution.
The above-mentioned example illustrates an important property of spatial dimensions.
They are divided into two groups.
They can be large, wide, and therefore directly visible, or, on the contrary, small, curved and much worse observable.
Of course, in this case, we didn't exactly anticipate to detect the "spinned" dimension of the hose's curved thickness.
It was enough to take a telescope to help.
But if the hoses were thinner — like hair or capillary — the folded dimension would only be detected with great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent Einstein an article in which he published the astonishing idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions known to us all.
Kaluza argued his radical claim that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be divided into a single, unified conceptual structure.
The question immediately arises as to how this Kaluz view goes along with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly stated and clarified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and curved dimensions.
This means that, like the dimensions in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has three large, large, and easily visible dimensions, the existence of which we are aware at every moment.
But analogously with the circular circuit of the garden hose, the universe can have additional dimensions, firmly curved into space so careless that they have remained hidden from even our most perfect experimental devices so far.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluzov’s remarkable design, let’s stay at the hose for a while.
Imagine that we draw a relatively dense number of circles in black on the circuit of the hose.
The distances of the hoses still look like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope now, thanks to the drawing, we will reveal the folded dimension even more easily, because we will see the motif in Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but besides one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, together four spatial dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help their imaginations a little, note the illustration in Fig. 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we enlarge the view of the geometry of the space in a similar way as we enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each next level represents a huge increase in space geometry from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (we see them on the fourth level of enlargement) if they are curved into a sufficiently small space; this explains that we have not yet directly observed them.
The square grid depicts the commonly known "large" dimensions, while the circles are new, small and curved dimensions.
Just like the loops of threads in a densely woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of normal dimensions - just for the sake of attention, we drew them only into the intersections in the square mesh.
The background of Figure 4 depicts the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - on such common scales as meters, shown by the side of a small square in a square grid.
In each of the following images, we will focus on a small area of the previous image; we will enlarge it to become visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we can see at the first few levels of increase.
However, when we move further along our path through the microscopic properties of the geometry of space - to the fourth level of enlargement in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new, curved-shaped circular dimension, similar to the loops in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions, just as hoses have a circular circumference at every point of their length.
In the interest of attention, we have drawn the circular dimension only at some points, regularly deployed.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluzov and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry.
The similarity with the tender is obvious, although we also note important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), while the hose has only one large dimension.
The even more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object within the universe, such as our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular curved dimension is extremely miniaturized, it is much harder to recognize it - as well as the circular circuit of the hose - than to observe obvious, large and extensive dimensions.
If the size of an additional dimension is small enough, it will actually reveal it beyond the strengths of our state-of-the-art enlargement tools.
The most important thing, however, is that the additional dimension is not just an oval bucket inside the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of three common wide dimensions.
It is a dimension on the remaining three dimensions independent as well as the dimensions of the top-down, left-right and front-back independent (and angled) to each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position, we would need four data, except for three more usual positions in the circular dimension; if we also count the time, then the data five, in any case, would be one more than a standard.
Are you interested?
You can buy the book The Elegant Universe by Brian Greeen here at booky.idnes.cz.
The price for the e-book is 149,- K<0xC4><0x8D>.
To our surprise, therefore, we find that while we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluzov and Klein’s thinking shows that this does not exclude the existence of additional curved dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe can easily have more dimensions than we can see with a single eye.
How small should they be?
The state-of-the-art technical equipment is able to recognize structures of a large billionth of a billionth of a meter.
We can barely see smaller curved dimensions.
In 1926 Klein combined the original idea of Kaluz with a few ideas from the newly-born quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the additional circular dimensions could be about the size of one Planck's length, i.e. the size far beyond the distinguishing abilities of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions the Kaluz-Klein theory.
Honza Homola advises how to exercise on an electric guitar: Part 5
The whole essence of the "twelve" consists in a twelve-tact harmonious form, which you can repeat at will.
Anyone interested in music theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homola Capsule (1976)
Education of a puppet and puppet, whose facebook profile can be watched here, has been living as a graphic since graduation twenty years ago.
She is the guitarist of the band Wohnout, which she cannot unfortunately leave.
The guitarist is after his father, as is brother Matthew, the leader of the Habitats.
Start your workout on a single string.
“The rhythmic model is just for you, you can come up with anything, then just apply it to the harmonious model of the twelve,” Honza advises.
When you add another string, you can change the shape again.
All you need to do is listen to and watch Honzu, what can be imagined with the twelve-tone harmony on two strings, and how well it starts to sound.
If you get the third string, you can already coquette with the melody of some song.
When you finally add the fourth, watch out for the change of alignment, Honza is alerted in the video.
Next time Honza returns to the pentathonic and you try to put it together with just the twelve.
So practice it honestly.
As best as possible, read this in an interview with Jan Homolo at his first lesson of electric guitar playing school here.
Another goal without waiting?
It’s not a big celebration, admits Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák Castle
We take a point and we like it.
The first half we had more chances, the second home," said the attacker, who scored from the penalty box this time.
You weren't nervous about playing it, were you just accompanied by a huge sand?
I didn’t see it in any way, even though on the other side, where home fans are, it would probably be worse.
You scored the penalty after half an hour, but you also scored the penalty after less than four minutes.
What's the matter?
We fell asleep at first, we were passive, there was a horn and then a penalty.
After that, you got up and you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
Hard to say.
I agree that we played well after the goal we scored until the break.
In the cabin we thought we wanted to keep the pace of the game after it, but we couldn't.
To be honest, I can't even explain why.
But it’s also true that the homeowners said something about the break to their game, they probably weren’t very satisfied with it.
You have scored on the opponent’s pitch for the first time, while you may not have scored a goal at home.
Why is there such a difference?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, it's more about us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Plze<0xC5><0x88>, this is a different category.
You were waiting for the goal in four games, weren’t you afraid it might be the same after the last game?
Maybe not, but of course we're glad that we don't have to talk about waiting for the goal since last game.
Now we added another one without waiting, but there are still only three in six games, which is not yet a big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from miles of a distant crater.
The lava flowing to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier, flows through an underground tunnel from a miles away crater.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the abovementioned underground lava tunnel.
This is what scientists are most concerned about now...
The situation, for the time being, remains unchanged.
Yesterday morning (31.8.)
2014) is still flying out of the crack approximately the same amount of lava.
However, as opposed to original estimates, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x larger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could open in places where it is located under the ice.
If this were to happen, with the same intensity as the current eruption, it would mean huge flooding, both on the Jökulsá a Fjöllum River and on other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption there is a strong smell of sulfur, clouds of steam and gases rise from the crack.
This is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case in the case of the Fimmvörd<0xC3><0xB8>háls eruption in 2010.
This is much larger and there is also much more gas here," says volcanologist <0xC3><0x81>rmann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, in the morning there was almost no wind in the area.
Footprints after the sandstorm were crushed by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
The air traffic shall be orange (second highest) for Bár<0xC3><0xB0>arbunga and yellow (third) for Aska.
Heaven over Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked through the wings.
Day of flight in Cheb.
The Boeing Stearman PT-17 airplane acrobat Peggy Valentin was introduced, which during the flight went out of the cockpit to the hedge on the upper wing of the two-stroke and also between the wings.
There it is referred only to the strength of the muscles.
The air day in Chebu took place for the fifth time this year and the organizers managed to prepare several interesting pieces of air again.
The premiere took place at the oldest Czech airport not only "walking through the wings" in the presentation of the German acrobat Peggy Valentino, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang or aircraft Beechcraft 18.
He drew attention to himself with his glowing cover.
Acrobatics called Wingwalking originates in the United States.
In the aftermath of World War I, many former war pilots attempted to deploy.
However, due to the large number of fatal accidents, he was banned.
Today, however, he is slowly returning to the airplane program.
Peggy's coming out of the cockpit to the top of the wing after the start.
There he performs various exercises.
At the end of the performance, she moves to the space between the wings of the plane, where her show continues," said Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Matejí<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Czech Ultralight Club and organizer of the day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main highlight of the program, then the next Mustang's performance was the famous cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter arrived on the surface with the Grippen of the Army of the Czech Republic in the curtain (so-called numbers).
This was the first time that aviation fans in the Czech Republic saw such a composition.
The pilot Miroslav Sazavsk<0xC3><0xBD> then showed everyone breathtaking acrobatics with a 1945 aircraft.
He was made during the war, but he probably never participated in it.
He was placed in the military reserves.
Since 1963 he has been active in the civil sphere.
Like a racing plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>ta.
In the same place is another Chevrolet Air Day pearl, the two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expedition.
There was no big machine at the airport to overlook.
His polished aluminum lining glowed far away.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard was also admired by the French Air Force.
The small transport aircraft was surprised by the turbocharged Turbolet and from the German Hof brought a part of the German delegation for the day of flight.
German neighbors in Cheb presented themselves with the reconstructed Jak 18T or three-member formation of the two-plane Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhyová: A dramatic comeback in front of the camera!
Lucie Borhyo exchanged parental concerns at least for tonight for those at work.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde moderator obviously knows nothing about it.
The moderation of the TV news went well for her, as if she hadn’t stopped with him for two months at all!
It was only two weeks before the blonde ended on Saturday, in which women experience the greatest stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not appear on TV Nova on a regular basis.
Regular return awaits her, according to Blesk.cz information up to a month.
After all, only her daughter Linda now needs her more than a television spectator.
Lucie Borhya returned to the TV screen and it was a black hit.
Exhibitions for a year in Prague?
Hala would sell out, plans to say goodbye Yagr
It would be decent if something like that happened during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union builds up," he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called The Golden Match, in which the stunning Nagan team reunited again.
Even the players who participated in the Golden Hattrick.
Players like it, don't they?
Sure.
In short, it would be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
I think they can find one or two days during the tournament, when it's completely free and where such a game could be interfering.
Let’s say that to Gum (Ji<0xC5><0x99>ima <0xC5><0xA0>légro) or Be<0xC4><0x91>i <0xC5><0xA0><0xC4><0x8D>erban (the organizer of the Yilava match), who would take care of it...
The arena would be sold out.
But what if you play with New Jersey play-off?
So when I get there...
You don’t want to play in the team.
Or did the Jihlava meeting somehow change your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and in representation are decisive performances.
One thing is that people would love to see me there, but performances are decisive, especially at the World Championships.
There should be players who have it there, not because they have a good name.
My decision hasn't changed.
How did you actually enjoy the Nagano search?
It was just a great meeting with the players.
The man revived the stories and experienced a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for our hockey players.
The most important thing, however, was the honor of Ivana Hlinka.
And it's good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that one generation is leaving, which was really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír R<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ka and Petr <0xC4><0x8C>echmánek on the switch.
Will you be able to play your first team match?
You can't forget things like that.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three young people: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we played in a threesome.
For all of us, it was the first start of the team.
But if we do dominate in some way, we can’t say that.
Dominik Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek was captured in Jihlava for a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
Hassan will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to give it back to him with that criticism, but I can't (Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek criticized Jágra for the reasons why he decided to end up in the team).
He also did a great show.
At the same time, he was training with me once in the night and there was a hole.
And now he's caught famously.
First in the USA and then in the Netherlands, the qualifications for footballers start
Prominent guests sat down at the NH Hotel Smíchov on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, goalkeeper Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech from Chelsea, team coach Pavl Vrbo...
And there, that character in a black shirt, that's Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Rosick<0xC3><0xBD>!
Arsenal defender and captain of the team came to a meeting about half a dozen among the last.
We have a great match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn’t be pleased?” he said as he appeared before journalists already in the team.
Category: Czech national team
Monday, September 1st: start of Wednesday, first training
Tuesday 2nd September: Training open to fans (18:30, Summer) Autogram (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) End of Coverage
Fans can support Russia and the United States even before Wednesday’s match against the United States (20:15).
The delegation opened a training session for them on Tuesday, which starts at 18:30.
And then there will be an autograph, which neither Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> nor Chech will be missing.
Otherwise, the meeting of the national team will be more relaxed.
This is commended by coach Vrba, who had just complained about the number of social events in the spring.
We will finally be dedicated to what we want to be dedicated to.
Now we will focus on the Netherlands.
It’s an advantage if you have the players together for eight days.
We’ll have time to practice things that haven’t been so long,” Vrba, who has been running the national team since January, said.
The Czech football team will be accompanied by a mosque image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The team has three matches behind it, all ready.
Norway and Finland scored 2–2 and Austria lost 1–2.
However, these results have not yet been important.
That's right now.
In a match with the Netherlands, he will start qualifying for the 2016 European Championship.
Of course, it would be helpful for the Czech army to manage a general against the United States.
The first half was to get to know each other.
The results are important now.
We have to think about it to be successful,” Vrba agreed.
The only player in the twenty-three-member nomination who has health problems is David Lafata.
He's got the heat.
If he could not recover for Wednesday's game against the United States, coach Vrba would have summoned another striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed.
A woman from Britain describes how she thought she would die after a bad diagnosis for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence assuming that she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The CMT UK charity said that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
It is believed that around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which can manifest motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, immobile walking and twisted toes.
The affected may also experience insensitivity or pain, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms worsen.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freireich's ataxia (FA), a disease that has a very poor prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her eighteenth birthday, she would be tied to a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
A mother of two, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as everyone else.
I fell down every day and it took me longer.
“I’ve never been able to ride wheels or skateboards with other kids, and I’ve been bullied at school because of how I walked and ran.”
When Rodgers was thirteen, and after several surgeries to release her Achilles' stools and straighten her feet, she took advantage of the fact that her doctor left the room, and looked into her documentation where she learned she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty for slipping, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I came home, I searched for information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” she says.
When they answered, I was shocked, I was completely panicked.
I thought before I was eighteen, I would end up in a wheelchair, and before I was twenty-five, I would be dead, and in the meantime I would gradually lose all my abilities.
I was all alone and I was planning a funeral.”
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she expected, and she asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said, "Honey, I don't think you're sick here, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair.
I think it will be a much less life-threatening thing.”
After completing several genetic tests, it was found to have CMT.
“When he explained to me what CMT is, I thought I was a happy child,” she said.
The CMT UK charity has started a month of awareness about CMT to alert to the disease.
Entrepreneurs in the Washington area: with the turnover of the economy, tax rises
Growing economy means more customers, higher sales, and new jobs.
And higher taxes as well.
According to a new survey published last week, state and local taxation of companies in a country with accelerating economic recovery grew slightly last year and companies in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia combined for fiscal year 2013 brought <0x24>27.6 billion to state and local treasury, an amount 3.8% higher than the <0x24>26.6 billion selected in 2012.
State and local tax burdens rose by 4.3% to <0x24>671 billion last year compared to 3.9% last year and were the third consecutive year of growth after 2009 and 2010, when taxes were lowered.
According to a study by professional firm Ernst & Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes rose 4.3% faster than local derivatives by 3.9%.
More than half of the county’s tax revenue, 56%, is from business tax, and 36% of Maryland’s revenue is from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, accounts for the lowest amount of tax revenue from business.
Researchers claim that the majority of tax revenue growth comes from the increase in the value of the property owned by companies, which this year’s property taxes increased by -1 per cent for three consecutive years with a growth of 3.7 per cent.
Although most of the profit comes from major states such as California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same situation is in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Virginia paid more than <0x24>10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, representing an annual increase of 4.2% compared to <0x24>9.6 billion in 2012.
The obvious increase in the value of real estate, however, does not so much raise state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate tax accounts for less than a fifth of corporate taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., real estate tax accounts for almost half of the state and local tax.
“In Maryland, a lot of real estate is owned by companies, especially the tax base around D.C., the government or non-profit organizations that don’t pay taxes,” explained Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income tax, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
Recent increases in tax revenues from businesses cannot be attributed only to the recovering real estate market.
According to the data, the revenues from the business are also rising.
Firms in the region have issued a <0x24>2.3 billion corporate income tax, which increased from <0x24>2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has collected <0x24>1 billion in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, local tax burdens for entrepreneurs are not growing in these three places as fast.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, at 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, there was a below-average tax increase of 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate of all three districts (all of which have the same taxation), 6%.
Maryland’s corporate tax rate is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxation and a generally more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. study has not been evaluated.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law to reduce corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the country continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, the income tax rate set by law could be reduced to 3 % in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businessmen in Washington are doing better, and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
Living tax imposed by small businessmen as a personal income tax – a cost-increasing compensation structure that most companies are organised by price-increasing – in D.C., Maryland and Virginia grew by 20% last year to <0x24>2.4 billion, not much more.
Researchers claim that the trend and the nationwide increase in trade tax will likely continue next year, with total tax revenues from sales to state and local governments rising by 6% compared to the same period in the first three quarters of the previous year, up from 6% in 2014.
However, Washington may be behind the others, as lowering state spending is picking up its labour market tax.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin Novorussko and Lafat’s scissors
Is there a new state in Ukraine?
Putin Calls for Negotiations on Novorussia
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government units have been colliding with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they will have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided to the West by the Ukrainian army’s wars in eastern Ukraine contradicts democratic values, he said.
The end of the conflict depends on Kiev, he said, and he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic has the right to disagree with part
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is set to propose a further imposition of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, the EU summit said.
This was reported to reporters by Herman Van Rompuy, the permanent chairman of the member states meeting.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals to move the form of sanctions are to be prepared as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new “President” of the European Union.
Van Rompuy to replace in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the head of the European Council at the European Union summit, the so-called EU President, who presides over the summits of the member states.
He will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years.
The head of European diplomacy is replaced by Italian Foreign Minister Catherine Ashton, Federica Mogherini.
Italy, which will become the Vice-President of the future European Commission, has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, only it is not spoken of

But if we don’t try, we won’t find out,” says Radim Mazanec, a motor neuroscientist.

A member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Stanislav Huml, has made it clear who shot down a Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is obvious that “hard sanctions, which were imposed in view of the shooting down of a civilian plane with almost 300 dead, were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army.”
In addition, according to the legislator, the CIA's manuscript is known.

Joan Rivers Family: “We hold our thumbs”
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was taken to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today that she does not lose hope that an eighteen-year-old comedian will recover.
“Thank you for your greetings and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the rescue service said she had a heart attack on a Yorkville endoscopy on the Upper East Side, a source said.
Physicians deliberately keep it under the influence of a sedative and under strict supervision until they are sure of its condition that remains “serious”.
The reactions to each other didn’t last long, including incredible online support from personalities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is a twisted headline
The fact that the media overwhelms reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) no news.
I know the headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who don't read anything else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me a lot lately, the more sophisticated it's rather the word stud.
This is especially the case with articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The words “Israel has attacked Gaza” are common.
It is only in the text that you read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the fired rockets from the Gaza Strip, often during the time of the ceasefire.
This will be titled “Both sides broke the truce.”
Does the journalistic community realize that through this process it is directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing across Europe (and not only there)?
Sixty years have passed since the end of World War II.
So far, there are people who have survived Shao.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the words "Jewish pig" and similar confidentiality, I was stunned.
Is the world trying to finish what Hitler didn’t do?
Are our journalists aware of the fact that after the Jews they were destined to eradicate the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen journalists, please take a little more care of your work.
You are often referred to as “the watchdogs of democracy.”
So defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to be maintained if one of our neighbors decides to eradicate the Czech people and eradicate the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also be aware of one more fact.
Almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in the State of Israel.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them why they don’t go to Gaza, for example, they will answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have work, social security and top health care (I saw myself at the top private Hadassa hospital, which is funded by sponsorship donations from Jews from all over the world, and Arabs, of course, are also attending and being treated there).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with its missiles.
The only real help for Gaza, and thus this restless area, is to get rid of it by Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, even indirectly in the titles.
Inform about Hamas’ practices, about its abuse of people as human shields.
Inform that Hamas aims to eradicate the state of Israel at any cost.
At the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Please note that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Please note that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area could have been flourishing thanks to humanitarian assistance from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which the Gazan administrators don’t pay, and they’re even upset that power supplies are interrupted occasionally at this time.
If Hamas did not invest money in the construction of underground tunnels to allow suicide bombers to penetrate Israel’s territory, but for example, in the construction of residential homes, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would live much better.
Amazon to buy Twitch for <0x24>1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed Monday morning’s Information: An Internet retailer — a video producer and hundreds of other things — is buying video streaming service Twitch for <0x24>1.04 billion (970 million dollars).
The announcement caused a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because it was expected that YouTube would be the buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google for <0x24>1 billion seemed certain, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which founded Justin.tv just three years ago, had pushed to become a widely used video streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players to broadcast online broadcasts from games on it - the words Business Insider "YouTube for Live Broadcasting".
Interface Twitch.
YouTube already has popular videos "Let's play", the kind where the muddlers (mostly older ones) play the Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube is shocked by the description of Twitch a lot, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch didn’t upset anyone, it was a tutorial example of how the company introduced will pay off the possible competition.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not come out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we currently have is the statement of Twitch CEO Emmet Shear: “We have chosen Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us fulfill it faster.”
The next mystery is – frankly – Twitch’s incredible success.
For snobs like me who claim to do sports rather than watch, it’s hard to understand what’s so amazing about games instead of real play just to watch.
One thing is to watch a friend play Resident Evil at three in the morning, and a completely different thing is to watch someone else get into his head in Call of Duty.
All the games that you could just watch.
Another problem is that many of today’s most popular games are from a player’s perspective, so looking at their records without you being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a khulav.
Admittedly, speed run games, in which the Rogers Banners of our electronic time finish the game in record time, are fun.
But if someone is not a master of play or humor, his channel on Twitch will probably not be very interesting.
What do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million visits per month and is fourth at the top of internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon use it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch getting involved in Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it might have been swallowed by YouTube.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Twitch Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "believe in the future of games" and the media don't seem to be shy, even as - a crawl - viewer.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by American atheist vlogger Arona Ra.
This time the theme is "The Holy Scriptures are the Word of God."
The original video is included.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that are contrary to their religion, they often confront us with the question: Whom will you believe?
The word of God, or the word of man?
It is as if human inquiry is completely null and void in comparison with the authority they imagine to have their doctrine.
Only when they say "man," they speak of science.
And when they refer to “the word of God,” they refer to myths about God written by people.
If there really is an intelligent creator with a purpose, then it is he who created the fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic formulas that correspond to it, and it must be he who has added the details to the further sequence of evidence that will show the evolutionary narrative.
Why else would all of these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
Humans couldn't create any of these things.
But people can tell stories, tell fabulous stories.
And it was the people who wrote all the texts that they pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy doctrine of any religion in the world describes itself as written by people, not gods.
People who were “driven” or “inspired” by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictatorship of angels, but these texts were written by no one but mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and not gods at all.
If there really was one true God, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, an over-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the whole cosmos.
If a creature of this size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, one holy scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors would not be able to measure such a work.
And people would not have to believe it blindly, because it would be consistent, based on verifiable and true evidence, and would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It will continue to inspire every reader to unite the common faith.
If God had written it, we would not expect anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of the one religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without a common origin, and all of them are constantly disintegrating into more and more separate denominations, seeking the controversial truth, and each one demands in some way the divine guidance in every direction, in every direction, without a hindrance.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospel, the Islamic Quran, Bahá'u'lláh's Kitáb-i-Akdas, the Zarathustra Avesty, the Sikh Adi-Granth, the Mahabharata Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, the Qur'an, and the Book of Urantia are all "true" characters.
The only logical explanation is probably that, to some extent, everyone is on the road.
None of the above-mentioned books have any advantage over the others.
None of them has any evidence, and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the University of West Michigan.
I am not saying that I have proven that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course he's not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apology (defendants) because they contain irregularities, absurdities, and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So it cannot be claimed that they are proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them are promoted by disgusting abominations instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecies - with each of them also containing prophecies that were not fulfilled.
Theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions, and views of their primitive and often politically motivated authors, which they do not explain in many of these biblical passages and verses.
I wouldn’t call it contradictions, but mutual comments.
We must point out again that we have two different authors here whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial revision.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not an obvious witness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e. the five Books of Moses, and they attribute none of them to the authorship of Moses, because it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents were re-filtered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as the Bible thinks.
Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, and yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, and Egyptian Chinese.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by Doctrine and Ebionites and their completely different views on Jesus, which eventually combined in some compromise called Orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups such as the Luciferians were discredited and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these changes relates to King Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the youth of the Mosaic religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to ridicule and Baal Zebul, “The Lord of the Mountain,” changed to “The Lord of the Mosaic.”
So the Bible was deliberately and misleadingly altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what became the New Law was canonized in the 4th century C.E. in a series of commission decisions at the Nicaea Parliament.
The four gospels were accepted, and the sixteen more were rejected by a simple hand-lift, as if the reality of some things were allowed to be accepted or rejected by voting.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read about Sundays in the Christian centers of the time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Jerusalem Church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually they found that they were approaching the same evangelical stories.
Thus the core of the canon evolved from the narrowness of the original church.
So the Council simply accepted as gospel any relevant stories that were circulating among the untrained masses at that time.
But they also deliberately removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were referred to by the books that were approved.
Among the rejected items are the records of both the Apostles and the Prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer to books that are only the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God was the real author of this coincidence mix of reputations, likenesses, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by people and certainly not too enlightened, rather the contrary!
That’s why so much of its content is historically and scientifically entirely wrong, regardless of almost anything from the beginning to the end.
We’re talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could speak, believed in spells, bloody sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fireworks, astrology, and five nerves of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic bar to sprinkle someone's blood, it would cure him from the lepra.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were survivors, and non-birds were birds, and whales were fish, and it's a whole number.
These people believed that if they show pregnant cows striped patterns, they will give birth to striped calves.
How could anyone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the errors it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would contain nothing of what it contains.
As a moral guide completely fails because, most of the original Hebrew scriptures were written in unskilled and bigotry savages who overlooked or promoted cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slavery, slavery, slave abuse, slave abuse, abuse, abuse of slaves, and abuse of slaves.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming that they are doing God’s will.
But the creators are still ignoring all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why?
Because if the creationists didn’t have their beloved books, they wouldn’t have a god.
There is one and the other in their world.
It is ironic that they reject God’s “work” as “the worship of creation rather than the Creator.”
But they themselves regard the word of man as the word of God and God himself, and they even insist that the rejection of their supposedly "holy" books somehow rejects God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians believe that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible could at the same time be wrong, because they cannot separate the doctrine from the deity.
So it’s a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations, as if these books were the very God, because they think they are JEHOVAH’S word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the scriptures of any religion.

Attacker in Chinese school beats nine people, three of them dead
A man named Chen, according to the New China agency, entered the primary school building this morning violently and attacked around 11:00 local time.
Three out of nine people who had been beaten later died in the hospital.
Chen was later killed by a jump from a height, New China said with reference to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
Therefore, the public is calling for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where many married couples have only one offspring in line with government policy.
Zeman showed his classmates how he had to sit in school.
The smallest schoolchildren took the nine to their class, where they and the teacher waited for the president to arrive.
He then showed the children how he had to sit alone in the school.
“We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, luckily you are no longer free people,” Zeman told the children.
His wife then handed it over to the first children as a gift to the heads.

This year, there were 115,000 first-class students.
In total, more than 850,000 children will attend primary schools and more than 405,000 students will be educated in secondary schools, the Ministry of Education estimates.
The new art director of Novy's news is David Fiala
The new art director of Nova TV news and advertising has been David Fiala since September 1.
He replaces Alan Zárbu, who has led the creative division of the entire Nova Group since 1 June.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphics department of news television Z1.
For the last two years, under the leadership of Alan Záruba, he participated in the realization of the complete visual transformation of the news sessions of the Television Newspaper, Str<0xC3><0xA6>piny, Prásk! and other publicistic television programs of Nova.
David Fiala manages very well the synergy of communication between editorial, studio management and the graphic department, which is the essence of the art director’s work.
He has a sense of typography and pure elegant design, which is the path we want to take further in the vision of Nova news,” says Nova’s creative director Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud allegedly subjected to hackers, nude photos of celebrities got to the public
Screenshot with printout of unique files
As of now, an anonymous user on 4chan publishes nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, American server Mashable.com warned.
He allegedly gained them by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple’s servers, where the affected users uploaded them through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple hasn’t spoken about the problem yet.
Some celebrities reject the images as fake, but already several of the affected images have confessed to the authenticity.
Among them are actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for her title roles as Katniss in the film series Hunger Games or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in The Deadly Cause 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the acquired images and videos to enrich.
The footage was reportedly of interest in U.S. magazines, according to reports on 4chan, but the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web, it’s probably really about the vulnerability in iCloud security.
On the GitHub server two days ago, there was a tool that enabled you to get passwords to user accounts through gross force, i.e., automatically repeating attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool was proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the release of this tool.
For preventive reasons, iCloud users should change their Apple ID-associated password.
What matters is the length of the password, not its complexity.
Suitable for a length of at least 12 characters.
The escape of the naked images of celebrities to consider as a reminder of safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies like Apple, Google or Microsoft are many times better secure than computers in homes or smaller companies, uploading sensitive photos in an unprotected form is a unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt the files before uploading them first.
It is also reasonable to set up automatic backup of photos from your phone so that it runs only on wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
So you will be able to timely move sensitive images "to safety", and mainly you will have space to delete unlisted images, so they will not take up unnecessary space in the online storage.
Instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer HN and IHNED.cz readers in the form of an e-book by Michal Altair Valá<0xC5><0xA1>ka in PDF format.
A smart way to save for a college script.
Since the price for a college script for many students exceeds <0x24>1,000 a year, the upcoming second-year student came up with a smart way to cut costs.
He invented a system of borrowing books from colleagues from senior year-olds with a nominal compensation offer to delay their resale.
“I got a calculating book, which normally costs <0x24>180, for a semester for ten and for chicken nuts,” says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
Books required in his last semester would cost <0x24>430, he says.
Wasted 120.
According to the University Council, the average student spends more than <0x24>1,200 a year on textbooks and grants, but students have different options to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students is to become online stores and creative solutions such as Schroeder.
The lending of textbooks is on the rise, allowing students to use the semester book, often with a significant discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 bookshops on campus sites, says book lending has doubled since 2011.
A survey in the industry shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the textbooks are purchased, according to the National Association of University Trades in University Bookshops.
Here are 101 best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books may be up to a third lower on the internet than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost <0x24>290, but it can be purchased online at Chegg.com, a textbook retailer, for <0x24>239.99.
Purchase used
If you don’t mind other people’s notes or wear and tear, the textbooks are used as a suitable option.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for <0x24>93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for the used print “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.”
The new one was sold for <0x24>48.
University teacher Ingrid Bracey, the head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their faculty whether older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes for work in seminars are not significant.
If yes, older editions may be sold for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular alternative to buying used books.
Loaning
It is also worth considering the lending of textbooks, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need to have them even after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow a “Calculus” for a whole semester for about <0x24>20.
Get acquainted with the terms and conditions of the store in which you borrow the book, including the disability for notes, highlighting or wear and tear.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of a new book.
E-books
Another option is to take care of yourself instead of a normal e-book.
Sometimes these books are basically borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows "Calculus" for six months for about <0x24>61.
According to Bracey, the best offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends conducting according to ISBN, as it guarantees you’re buying the right book.
Before you order a book online, make sure it’s really in stock, Gault advises.
He was convinced of it on his own.
The book he bought was sold for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for a book from a university bookstore.
It's the same thing.
And then they found in the well a torso rifle from the end of the war
This well stands a short distance from St. George's Church.
We discovered growing around and we started pulling a flying apple - about a meter and a half of mud and debris leaves.
As we approached the clay bottom, we hit the head,” Radomil Novak said.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found it to be the torso of the German assault rifle used by the SS units.
The finding is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, such guns were manufactured until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," added Novák.
All wooden construction items have been decomposed over time, so it is unusable.
However, her body is preserved - it retains its shape.
How was the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by the SS units, probably out of fear of being thrown away.
The Fascists on the run wouldn't do that.
They dropped their guns in the woods," he thought.
The rifle was the only thing that fans of the Spirit of the Fallen Movement found in the well.
"There may have been hand grenades, there were once a lot of them all around, so we slowed down the excavation work, we carefully dumped the mud so that there was no accident, but there was nothing else down there," Novák said.
The find ends in the museum’s repository at the castle in nearby Slezské Rudoltic.
Ukrainian General: I have not released the prisoner Chech yet
Exclusive interview with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists.
Kyiv/Prague - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... they call me from Donetsk," he apologized eight times in an exclusive interview with Ukrainian Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also the director of the Center for the Liberation of the War.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in the TV debate.
At each such interruption, it was not possible to hear the names of the people, their numbers, or the places where they are - or should be - that Ruban specifies with his opponent on the other end of the phone.
"That'll be it - go there," he concluded one of the flashy discussions with Donetsk and once again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a backup general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests in Majdan.
Yesterday - when we agreed to the interview - he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists is twenty-four hours a day.
Currently.cz: You may know that the Czechs are also fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number to thirty.
But there can be a lot more of them.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have liberated already captured Serbs, Dagestans, Chechens, one Swedes, Georgians... but not yet Czechs.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we hit your prisoner countryman and could free him.
Ukrainian Soldier Detained by Separatists
A.cz: What advice do you give to the Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian soldiers?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they fight in the Ukrainian flags of volunteers and the separatists occupy them, they will be shot without mercy after interrogation, just like any other stranger.
Separatists regard these men as mercenaries, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers occupy a group of Donetsk separatists – and among them, for example, the Czech Republic – they put him behind bars and treat him like a prisoner of war.
This guy's gonna survive.
The Ukrainian side also acts in war as a state.
A.C.: And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you saved?
If I understand it well, I'll exchange it.
Some sources say that it has already exceeded a hundred men a long time ago.
A long time ago, we stopped counting how many people we helped.
But we've only freed them... we haven't saved them from the war if they decide to continue fighting.
The rescuers are doctors, surgeons in the war, but we certainly don't.
That's it.
And every day there are more and more.
We're saving someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four, sometimes five.
It doesn’t always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes a mere human request is enough to release the prisoners.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained great authority and even confidence from the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you build respect for both sides of the war?
That's a tough question.
One of the officers in Kyiv gave me the nickname "a crazy general with steel balls."
It doesn't bother me.
And maybe that explains the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Officers’ Corps, I have acquired this authority before.
I never lose, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
No matter what happens, I'm honest and I'm telling the truth.
Even when it is very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhansk government.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them they're tortured and killed.
And that they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even when I'm being taken prisoner... this job can mean an end to me at any time... I don't have to come back.
A.C.: How many executions and tortures do you know?
... (short silence)... Ukrainians and separatists are repealed for torture during interrogations.
I'm sorry.
What about the repairs?
They only take place on the donor side.
I have no information about the fact that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
There is no indication that the Ukrainian military will do something similar.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I can't and don't want to.
A.cz: Describe the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officers, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are trying for independence and perhaps even for democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk – at least that’s what they say.
They no longer want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
Separatists already have oligarchs full of teeth and are their irresistible opponents - to life and to death.
As we say, they're overeating them all the way to the throat.
By the way, the same dreams and claims were made public in Maidan.
And now I wonder a little: Russia supports the separatists and the West, on the contrary, supports the Ukrainian state.
I think one speculation is big and the other is small.
This is my sentence, but there is an irresistible contradiction in it.
A.cz: How do you feel about one of the toughest leaders of pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of the war front, I am gunless and show soldiers or armed men empty-handed.
And they always have me on both sides of those two hundred or three hundred meters on the fly or in an optical target.
I see the faces of the people who are aiming at me every time... and they can touch the trigger of their guns at any time.
Commander, experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small government in a great Russian empire.
In any case, he is constantly talking about it and considers Ukraine to be some kind of misunderstanding.
He believes that such a state should not exist.
At the same time, he is an invincible enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters – in the Ukrainian TV discussion show, you called your prime minister Arseniy Jace<0xC5><0x88>uk a weak, helpless and tired “leader” who would do best if he left quickly.
For those three hundred meters of walking, I always get at least five times the fear.
So why should I hide the view that Jace<0xC5><0x88>uk is a very weak prime minister and that it hurts our country?
A.C.: Do you think he has a share in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians nicknamed Jace<0xC5><0x88>uk "the king".
And the rabbit is not in the eyes of Ukrainians an animal that would fear or have respect and authority for others.
His behavior directly copies the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister, he has no right to cry in parliament, to ask him, to play with him his intrigues, to threaten to post office... he has to run, manage, and protect the country in time of war.
When the country is threatened, the prime minister has no right to family, friends, rest for crying emotions.
He is the first Minister of Ukraine.
What about Jace<0xC5><0x88>uk?
She's acting like a puberty girl.
Yes, he's tired, but also weak because he's never been strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just constantly complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy Couldn't Save Sales
Sylvester Stallone's return was less than <0x24>30 million from the 90 million budget in the United States, and Sin City: The Woman for whom I would kill was only <0x24>12 million from the 70 million budget.
The movie “Sex Tape” with Cameron Diaz made only <0x24>14.6 million during the first weekend, and movies for kids like How to Train Dragon 2 were disappointing for cinema.
According to Robbie Collin’s article in Telegraph about children’s films, their quality is their fault.
Collin called 2014 the “worst” year of children’s movies and called How to Train Dragon 2 a mere “functional” continuation.
When it comes to films deployed to a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem may not necessarily be the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average ratings of summer premieres aired in at least 2,000 cinemas between War Victims Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, taking into account the views of viewers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film crop is of similar quality to last year’s hits.
According to some commentators, a change in viewer access and the increased popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix may be at fault.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s Jungle Book processing, told the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We have to admit it and try not to chase after what has already been.
Unlike the current Hollywood cash market crisis, Netflix’s net profit from online services has reached <0x24>1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year’s <0x24>837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studio for relying too much on the rights to comic books, and predicted the "revolution" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators declare that there may be something on his catastrophic tale.
With the introduction of possible big cash markets in the summer of 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimon and the Jurassic World, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in sales as simply "cyclical" and told Hollywood Reporter, "Next summer will be the summer of the biggest cash markets in history, and no one will worry about sales."
KLDR threatens Seoul again, launches another short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul said.
The alleged test of the missile took place shortly after the end of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as preparations for the invasion.
Chagang Province is located in the northwest of the DPRK on the border with China.
A spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry said the missiles were fired from a location in the northwest of the DPRK and reached a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea reportedly fired a rocket from Chagang province for the first time, South Korean media said, calling for military circles.
In the province, there is said to be an underground fire ramp for Scud-type missiles.
This is another of a series of similar tests carried out by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has carried out an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, protests were held by the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to take part in a campaign against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting, which was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough monitored the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters who had arrived from Bridgend in Belgium.
Teenagers must have been transported by air from the Blue Mountains
TWO young tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A sixteen-year-old girl and an eighteen-year-old man went on a tour to Govetts Leap in Blackheath on Sunday afternoon.
When they did not return home, the family concerned called the police around eight o’clock in the evening.
A search team, including local police and a rescue team, was sent, and a couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls at about eleven o'clock in the evening.
The girl hurt her knee, and the man fell and hit her head.
Police stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In the stabilized state, they were transported by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, the victory was on your feet.
The 23-year-old was able to decide, but he failed in the top two chances.
After the goal, she mainly called the shot about three minutes before the end, but the place in the net ended at the goalkeeper of Opava Josef Kv<0xC4><0x9B>to<0xC5><0x88>.
I had it on my leg, I have to give it a chance.
I'm angry with myself," your little ash fell on his head.
"Maybe I should have put it up under the lid, a little bit of it," he thought.
Sigmy's defense didn't allow Opa much, except for Mikul's 11-minute attack, which was covered by goalkeeper Reichl.
Then they started pushing the Hanaci, but they didn’t let them go in the block defending the domestics, and the shots were captured from a distance by Kv<0xC4><0x9B>to<0xC5><0x88>.
We took 15 minutes and then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more of the game and Opava only threatened us with standard situations.
But Vasí<0xC4><0x8D>ek didn’t change the odds, so it ended 0-0,” Hanákkos coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1>e Kalvod hated.
Opava also took the point because of the absence in the assembly, where, in addition to the two wounded, Petr Vav<0xC5><0x99>ík and the three-man shooter Petr <0xC5><0xA0>ev<0xC4><0x8D>ík, who are staying in Slezsk from Sigma, were also missing.
This, unlike its previous policy, did not allow them to act.
Substitutes deserve an exemption.
Sigma worked more football, but we didn’t let it do anything except one standard,” said Slezan coach Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and combat.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent gain for us," he added.
Sigma got four points in the draw, which means thirteenth place.
Nothing could satisfy the head of the club Josef Lébra, who, after defeating Znojm, conditioned his millionth deposit to the cashier with diametrically different performances in the next matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébra's warning, so it cannot be said that the boys would not want to fight," Kalvoda noted, adding to the address of the sleeping shooter Vasí<0xC4><0x8D>ek: "I believe it will come and when he scores, it will start to fall there.
But after the first hit, I'll replace him immediately so he can save his goals for the next match," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino beat Venice twice.
The film festival is experiencing a crisis.
After a huge enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iñárritu ranks among serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the following days gave the impression that the interest in the 71st anniversary of the Venice festival was somewhat lost.
Whether it was because the number of seats in the largest room increased to fourteen hundred, or because critics followed Birdman's acclaimed, but less attractive footage as a documentary about the genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s, the look of the silence and other movies from the social theaters.
Heroes of Comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace hasn’t bloomed as much as in the past, and it’s said to have stopped being a problem getting a last-minute place in the hotel.
The crisis in Italy is more talked about than anywhere else, and it is no wonder that institutions such as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world have been affected.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest itself in the shortage of personalities, but present only in the context of films.
While younger fans longed for the autographs of the superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who successfully played dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations, the visit of the legendary actor Ala Pacinna became the main event.
He also lights up in two movies.
In the Out-of-Competition Story, filmed by Oscar-nominated Barry Levison in Philip Roth's novel, forty-seventy-year-old Pacino plays a role he is close to: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from depression from the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the second day as the strange owner of ironworks from the rural town of Manglehorn, filmed by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi's Cup for Best Actor Performance should not be minted - but does Pacino's format artist still need prizes?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, especially the Italian, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the country from which his grandparents came.
Bodies for Italy
This year, the Italian film is going very well in Venice.
The Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became Birdman's first award-winning long-running applause.
The Calabrian branch of the mafia is seen in a view of the family relationships between clans fighting for power and money, and the director has been able to match all the assumptions for a good film: quality script, camera, music and actor.
He was also involved in the chamber psychothriller Hungry Heart, which filmed Saverio Costanzo with Alb Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who, with her scary anxiety, almost kills her own child.
On the contrary, the French competition films did not expect a warm reception, neither the Redeemer for Glory, nor the three hearts, both of which are based on the traditional model of consumer films, based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really great movies, namely Birdman and Black Souls, are not so few in the first half of the festival.
And while the festival photos are all-encompassingly depressing, a new photo by Peter Bogdanoviche called She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy out of competition in Venice and filmed in the style of American cheerleaders of the 1940s, was able to pick up a day off.
Police arrested four pervitin producers in Prague, drugs drove from Poland
"The detectives have detained three men, aged 42, 42 and 37, and a 25-year-old woman, who manufactured and sold pervitin in Prague 9 from November to August this year," police spokeswoman Jana Rössler said in a statement.
First on Tuesday, August 12, an intervention unit in Cihlá<0xC5><0x99>ska Street caught a twenty-four-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who appeared in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a dealer.
The next day, the detectives detained another member of the group, a thirty-seven-year-old man, with the prior consent of the prosecutor.
The last of the four policemen arrived on Wednesday morning, August 20, in the area of the Malaysian fireplace," a spokeswoman said.
Woman receives a third of drugs for transporting drugs from Poland
The main organizer had a wide range of activities.
In the workshop of the aerial, in a garden house in Horom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice, in an apartment in Kon<0xC4><0x9B>vova Street and elsewhere in Prague 9, he produced pervitin, provided various auxiliaries and chemicals necessary for its production and provided the transport of medicines with pseudo-republican ephedra.
He also weighed the manufactured drug, divided it into plastic bags, and then sold pervitin.
He was assisted by a 25-year-old, yet unpunished woman, with the transportation of drugs from Poland or the sale of drugs to drug addicts.
For this, she was rewarded by the organizer in the form of a third of the drug manufactured,” Rössler added.
The criminals also carried out several home inspections on the order of the judge, where they secured drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, pay bags, syringes, syringes and other accessories and items, which can be considered as complete according to the experts.
The dealer has been convicted seven times since 1995.
"From the available records, the police found that the main organizer had been sentenced seven times for property crime since 1995, and the woman had not been sentenced," a police spokeswoman said.
The last detainee was convicted of sexual abuse in 2006 on parole and the 70-year-old automechanist, who is being prosecuted for freedom, has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
It was also mainly for his own property incrimination.
The investigator accused three men and women of committing a crime of illicit production and other handling of narcotics and psychotropic substances and poisons, threatening them with up to a decade in prison.
In the case of three persons, the investigator also submitted to the state prosecutor a motion to establish a bond, where the judge finally placed them,” the spokesperson said.
The fourth defendant, a thirty-seven-year-old recluse, was released.
His position and role in this case was not as essential as the other defendants.
The police are still working with this man.

Disruption of high schools and high schools makes no sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and statistics also show that high school students have a good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There have been great preparations in schools in the last 14 days.
It is usually a routine matter, such as transferring flowerpots from the summer storage back into classes and squeezing the ridges.
They're going to have a little bit more of a gymnasium.
A few days before the start of the season, furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature are collected into the library.
There has been no theft or fraud, the four-year high school in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice opens and renews its activity after three years.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders were so incompetent.
They had to wait for the existence of the school to be confirmed by entering the M<0xC5><0xA0>MT-managed school register.
“French socialists should shut up and put France in order,” says key ally Françoise Hollande.
Valls calls on the heavily fragmented left to “show its support” to a war-aligned socialist president, whose new division of functions did not meet the consent of most French people.
The President deserves general respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay by his side," he said, picking up the applause.
As a conciliatory gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French thirty-five-hour working week, despite the passionate agreements made by Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who at the beginning of the week would vote for the right.
On Saturday, Hollande called on the socialists to remain "coherent" with the government.
But Justice Minister Christiane Taubir made a line across the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for “losing faith in the future by the French.”
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extreme conservative right, laughed at the constant internal disputes between socialists when she said she did not expect the new Valls government to last for more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls was also forced to form a new government when the previous government did not last until the end of the summer.
“And the new one will not last until the end of autumn or winter,” Le Pen told her supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament and stated that she was convinced that it could win the party's early elections and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections, and in May, the extremely conservative right succeeded in the elections to the European Parliament.
According to a public opinion poll published in the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions before the end of the Dutch term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would soon have patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
“It’s a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there are changes in the situation,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Gambling and street art are no longer limited to elections in Prague
Amendments to the relevant declarations should be prepared and approved by the new capital management.
Other games will not disappear from the streets of Prague before the municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
There will be no restrictions on dog marriages.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve the amendments to the respective declarations in the representative office until the October elections.
"In addition, the decision on the changes should not be made by the current city leadership, which ends its mandate in a few weeks," said Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Manhart (TOP 09).
In the past few weeks, several municipalities, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to cancel flat gambling on their territory.
However, the games will not disappear, the gambling announcement will not change yet.
This is the task of the new city leadership after the election.
Now we wouldn’t be able to do that technically, given, for example, the deadlines for comments and the like,” Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current delegation, which must approve the amendment of the declaration, will take place on September 11.
A referendum on the ban on gambling will be held on the day of municipal elections in the districts of Prague 1 and Prague 8.
There is currently a ban on gambling, for example, in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the declaration will not change in the case of street art, so-called busking.
In particular, Prague 1 complains about this one, which has already sent a proposal to the Master of Places, which she would like to expand the current list of prohibited places.
Musicians also don’t want Prague 5 in the vicinity of Angela.
The announcement regulating the wedding of dogs in the city is ready for several months, yet it is not completed.
The placement of the mayors and the problem of busking solves the urban declarations.
It can only be issued or edited by the representative of the capital.
Councillors have only an advisory vote, they are not allowed to make statements themselves.
Last week he placed the win on Scottish independence supporters at the fingertips
The Scottish Independence Campaign was in danger of making this mistake for the third time, when it barely placed on billboards across Scotland the question of whether the Scottish people want to be rich.
But you won’t get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, nor will you gain their respect when you start threatening them.
The morality of the New Law is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots tend to drive the exchangers out of the temple far more than let them dictate how to vote.
Scottish nationalist leader Alex Salmond knows this well, and that’s why he repeatedly asked his opponent, Unionist Darling, whether he was willing to respect the “sovereign will of the Scottish people” if the Scottish voters voted for independence, and began to support the unity of the nation.
This caused Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and he fell into this trap with grimace.
Of course, Darling will not support the mandate of Scottish voters.
However, the discussion about how Scotland will have the currency has already been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and public health protection that citizens have for free.
Darling supported London’s bankers in terms of currency and also gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatization of healthcare.
As Salmond said, "he went to bed with the conservatives."
This is a very dangerous situation for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland not to voters, but to the "boss" association, to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron’s refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly homeless absentee.
The Scots would respect him if he came to a debate with the Scottish prime minister.
Cameron has at least been able to say that Scotland can be a “successful independent country.”
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost physical pain.
What he communicates is clear: Scots don’t have to jump out and have to accept what they are.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic start of school by Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Urbana
Illustration to the story The longest year
Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Urban Longest year
The end was the best of the holidays at all, the last week we hadn’t gone anywhere and we were just walking and catching up with our grandmother the summer, the silence from the storm, the calm from the stress.
New clothes, when it was possible to get from Tuzex, boots from East Germany.
The reading of the Fast Arrows, in the late 1960s, the rolling of the wheels up around the Imperial to the rear behind Vary, somewhere to the tennis courts, it was no longer warm, the sun flickered back and shoulders, flashed to the farewell.
In the evening, mild nervousness, still in the holiday mode, sleep until half an eleven, in a week will be worse, the moments before going to sleep stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then get up at half a seven in the morning.
He'll be here Monday.
Most of the time, on the contrary, summer is ugly in front of school.
To plunge into the aerial light on the canopy and to feel like a plastic figure in a glass mine, there's that school, ZD<0xC5><0xA0> A.
A slut with a blurred pink nut, and in front of her old familiar faces and a couple of new, boys more attractive, girls more bustier.
There's grasslands out there, avoiding them, it's interesting how infallibly they hold together and how soon they're here.
And these grown-up-looking girls who came in screaming, laughing at something hysterically now, maybe something has changed in their lives over the holidays, while I'm all old.
And the new prime ministers, some nervous and other stress, why do they even come down here?
Because it must, education war is mandatory.
So, inside, the cold moisture of the floor and the slight smell of disinfection, the poisoned schoolboy with mope, unfortunately, the same thing still lends the pupil keys from the sheet metal cabinet, where they can leave the textbooks and which there are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dress remains in memory, now it is not done, it is well explained, but in a week it will be worse.
It's only from that idea that the stomach is crawling and the headache starts to start.
The head, which is even worse, the lesson of mathematics, the diabolical game for the chosen, of which I am not and will never be.
Again, the three and four, the god of five, hide from the trial, fall into the bench and best sublimate, not even be there, exist only as a name in the classroom and dream about the stories of the sweeter girls and the nicer buildings, not of the girls, not of the girls, not of the girls, not of the girls, not of the girls, not of the girls, not of the girls.
The longest year has ten months.
And it's only the first day, now as it was years ago.
She let her born daughter die.
She is in danger of an exceptional punishment - News.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in a public toilet cabinet at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without the help of a stranger, she was born a little girl, which she packed into ready-made blankets after crossing her nipple, hiding under her coat and took her to the roadside, where she laid it in the bushes a few dozen meters away from the road.
Born on the way to school
It came to me a little early.
I was on my way to school.
I needed to go to the toilet on the bus, where I was born.
She was born alive, staring at me.
I cut the peppermint cord with the scissors I wore to school," she described the defendant and said she was ashamed of being pregnant.
"The next day she returned to her place, put the child's body in a bag and took it away, took the body out of the bag, packed in a black gellit bag and hid it under the staircase in her grandmother's house in Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ka Brod," she says in a new suit with her daughter-in-law's death.
It could be tens of minutes, but also a few hours after childbirth, suffocation when covered with a blanket or when inserted under a coat, chilling or bleeding out of an unbound nipple.
A similar scenario was repeated next year in the spring.
A woman in the nearest unknown time from February to April 12, when the body of the child was found by random witnesses under a pond near a pond in Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>kobrodsk, gave birth again secretly herself.
This time in the bathroom of the loft apartment in the family house.
Without checking to see if she was born alive, without intersecting and bonding the chin, which was rounded around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic packages including a gel bag and left it in the bathroom.
Later in the afternoon, he and his partner were taken to the pond.
Eventually, her boyfriend gave her up.
The father of both children was a friend of the defendant, who allegedly did not know about his partner’s pregnancy.
Even for this reason, they are not now in court, only he has been punished for a crime against the Funeral Act.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like he's not being punished as a comrade.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know my solution wasn’t right, but it seemed to me at the time as human,” she said, not concealing the defamation of the defendant, who allegedly subjected the man to a relationship and feared him.
During her speech, the young woman spoke fairly balancedly.
Tears fell into her eyes until the moment she talked about the relationship with her parents, from whom she left when she reached adulthood.
She said she didn't want to kill
"They follow me every 14 days for a visit, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she said.
I didn't buy a kit because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I wanted to put the furt in the baby box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do that.
I can’t explain that to you,” she answered the judge’s question.
However, she refused to act with the mind and intent to kill the newborn.
In addition, the second child, according to her, was born dead.
Even during pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
But I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
“I’ve stopped smoking,” she said.
Although pregnancy was seen on her in both cases, she claimed to everyone, even on repeated questions, that she had health problems, that she was seduced.
And so does a friend.
The main allegations will continue in the castle court on Tuesday with the testimony of court experts.
A verdict could be made on Wednesday.
The woman is threatened with a penalty of up to 18 years in prison, or even an exceptional penalty.

Pro-Democratic activists in Hong Kong a day after voting decision provoked by Chinese authorities
A group of people loyal to Beijing, who had a Chinese flag, stood nearby.
The Permanent Commission of the National People’s Congress on Sunday approved that only two of the three candidates will take part in the 2017 elections in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first get the support of a nomination committee, which is likely to consist of loyal members of Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get on the ballots and force pro-democracy activists to renew their promises and protect Hong Kong’s financial centre of the “Occupation of the Central” movement.
Political reform in Hong Kong is the main cause of tensions, and Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing released a detailed report on China’s official authority in Hong Kong in June, Democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special office district and hundreds of thousands of people entered the city’s business district.
The press conference, attended by Prime Minister Li, is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Relations Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun and the Deputy Director of the State Council of the Office for Hong Kong and Macau, Feng Wei, were also to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists said they were meeting in front of the Hong Kong government office this afternoon.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin calls on Kiev to start negotiations with eastern Ukraine on “state sovereignty”
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday called for the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately initiate talks on “state sovereignty” in remote areas, according to a Russian newspaper.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin had no intention in his remarks to suggest that the areas of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed so that the Russian-speaking region and the Russian-speaking region can gain power and power.
Putin’s call on the Kiev government to treat the pro-Russian rebels as equal is consistent with the obvious strategy that has been in place since the riots broke out five months ago: help the separatists to occupy territory and force the Russian faction to exit the Ukrainian government.
In an interview for the first state television channel, Putin condemned Ukrainian military action to regain the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were controlled by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and the recently occupied separatists have labeled the territory as “New Russia” or “New Russia”, a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russia’s Itar-Tass news agency has released Putin’s words that it is a “prisoner of illusion” for anyone who believes peace talks are on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians launched a campaign before the October 26 parliamentary elections, while the governmental units of the civilians are separatist.
“In the interests of people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and the status of state sovereignty in southeastern Ukraine,” he said.
Mr Peskov said Putin’s attack on state sovereignty was conceived in the context of a broader autonomy, which has been discussed with the Kiev administration for several months and which is intended to alleviate the concerns of Russian-speaking areas about the threat of cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
It is not a matter to discuss between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The Kremlin spokesman’s move, which was to correct the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks, underscored Russia’s approach to solving the separatist uprising in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where the majority of the two million ethnic Russians are living in the woods.
Moscow would have much more trouble annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million people are not Russian, and public opinion polls that took place before the conflict showed broad support for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy discussed by Russian diplomats at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and thus essentially give the Kremlin actual control over the territory that would link the Russian mainland.
The Black Sea Peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to the main Russian naval fleet, maritime commercial territory and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia’s Rostov and Crimea are also the centre of the mines, factories and welders, which produce important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, during his inaugural speech on 7 June, suggested that Ukrainian lawmakers - after the new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language statutes.
But this vision of autonomy differs significantly from the vision of the Kremlin and the separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin’s last call for Kiev to treat the separatists as equal followed by another insurgent move last week after Russian troops and tanks from the formerly peaceful area along the Azov Sea penetrated eastern Ukraine.
The separatists reinforced by the Russians took control of Novoazovsk with such force that the Ukrainian security authorities are concerned that it is a pullout to occupy strategic coastal territories up to Crimea.
This accelerated the enormous civil and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with a metallurgical combination of 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoazovsky and a narrow gateway to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday, calling for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for the past 23 years.
“We are approaching a point from which there is no return,” Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of a closer unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kyiv on Saturday that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovakia after two columns of Russian armored vehicles were destroyed last week, and 1,000 military units were destroyed.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovakia during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian deployed troops captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Greece are also involved in the scandal with unveiled photos
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his dislike over the hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancé Gabi Greco and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is shocked after the biggest scandal with hacked photos of celebrities hitting the internet with a series of explicit nude photos of Jennifer Lawren.
Hacker claims he has sixty nude photos of Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
The evasion of iCloud allegedly brought to the public personal photos of Australian actresses Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Greece.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Greece for a hand last month, told Confidential magazine: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and all private images should be kept private and should be kept private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, has told online newspapers that the hacking is “unshaken” and those who have become its target “seem to be humiliated.”
The hacker is believed to have gotten thirty photos of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of him on top of the pool without breaking up.
For example, Palmer starred in the film Love and Honor, where her counterpart was Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, television star Chuck Strahovski and actress Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen images yesterday.
Lawrenc’s TMZ spokesman said, “This is a clear breach of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen tweeted: “Publishing photos of hacked phones is the same as selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigmy’s players have improved their Lébra even without a win
Olomouc - The thunders and lightnings that Olomouc co-founder Sigmy Josef Lèbr sent to his subordinates last week are apparently past.
Being from Opava was eventually brought only a point for a brandless remix.
The club bosses have only gotten a little more comfortable with the planting and fighting.
Money for payments could come to the club soon.
"I'm going to keep one more game as I talked about last week, but I'm far more optimistic," Lèbr said, adding that despite Sigma's not winning, the players convinced it with improved performance.
The fighting and dedication we played mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive him for not winning.
If we played this way since the beginning of the season, I’m sure we haven’t lost yet,” Lébr said.
In Opava, Sigma stopped the initial domestic pressure, then levelled the game and in the second half it was better.
After Kalvod's victory, the confidants sakhali, but they did not reach their goal, and thus they could not win.
The result is not in our view.
We just missed one chance to be completely satisfied," said Lèbr, who does not believe that the change in the approach of the footballers was caused only by his threat.
There were certainly several aspects.
Whether on my side, on the side of the coach or the fans," Lébr said.
With pressure Sigma has to count
Players did not want to comment much after the match in Opava last week.
I'm trying to get these things out of here.
I tried not to let it go," said young goalkeeper Michal Reichl.
Completely without comment, then left a question to Lébrov’s statement from last week’s attacker Václav Vasí<0xC4><0x8D>ek, who did not transform Sigma’s greatest opportunity in the Saturday match.
After all, he only spoke a little about the pressure.
We're under pressure all the time.
They're all trying to pull on us.
"Today we have shown that if we fight and ride all the fuck, it's going to work," he said.
Warnings are taken to heart
Even coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Kalvoda did not hide that preparation for the match was not the easiest due to the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realised it, and today it was seen that Mr. Lébra's warning was taken to heart.
Even though it wasn’t about not wanting to fight and blow it up,” the Olomouc coach said.
It was similar to the first 15 minutes today.
It took a while for us to compare the toughness and realize what the second league is about.
“It’s not just about football, it’s about fighting,” Kalvoda said.
It is only to hope that in the upcoming matches Sigma will work from the very beginning.
"I'd love to believe that," he added.
