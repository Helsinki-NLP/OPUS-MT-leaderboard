No release novel for Tymoshenko by Parliament
Ukraine’s parliament today rejected the request to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted in a draft of the Penal Code.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the detainee's prime minister, was rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the application for alleviation of penalties for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly detrimental treaty with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet valid, the appeal of convicts will be negotiated in December.
Tymoshenko himself referred to the judgment as a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West, the trial caused the suspicion of the prejudice of the court.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was convicted of removing from the Penal Code, was supported by 147 MEPs.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Victory of Libya
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and the war is over without him.
Only the winners can be defined.
As usual in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council became known as the customary law of Shar<0xC4><0xAB><0xCA><0xBF>a, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would be a country without crime, because for theft, you briefly hack off your hand.
Also, women should forget about emancipation as soon as possible, any faith-deceased being executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will in the future be united by the Koran from mutually dominant tribes.
In short, in Libya, there will be an order that is hardly conceivable in this country and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not even the only and objectively not even the best, and variation would hardly fit the Libyans mentioned.
In this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were able to help themselves at all by the unfaithful dogs.
Their apology may only be the fact that NATO’s airstrikes were not led by any American general, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only participated in a gunfight, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians unleashed themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any benefit.
After the fresh and bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to abandon a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the locals are left with a concern - namely the displacement of cruisers.
But does the mineral oil companies get the black gold at a spot price even without occupying it?
It is hardly possible for the West to finally boast of its independence in terms of the protection of human rights.
If they do not, the Shari<0xCA><0xB9>a representatives will destroy them.
The Beginning of a New Era of Crisis
France and the rest of Europe are focusing on investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm exploded across Europe.
The individual states published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated in comparison to the previous quarter, Germany and France.
But today the bond market breaks all records.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
Statistical offices in Europe, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, while France’s GDP is expected to grow by 0.4%.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% rather than predicted 0.1%), while France agreed a slight drop of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
However, as compared to the previous quarter, GDP stagnated, according to Statistical Office, the trend of growth slowdown in economic performance was confirmed.
The results are worse than the forecasts of analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally over-estimated figures, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Throughout the eurozone and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2 per cent compared to the previous quarter between July and September, in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
Returns from their 10-year government bonds jumped to 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish bonds rose to their critical limits.
Also Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are beginning to feel problems...
Returns on Czech government bonds remain below 4%, even though the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, votes will be heard that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualify for the EURO
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the entire season!
Thanks to a well-established <0xC4><0x8C>ech goalkeeper and a wonderful goal by Petr Jira<0xC4><0x8D>ek, she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, the Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will not miss the European Championship again.
IHNED.cz tracked the ascent game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech team also won quite happily 1-0 thanks to the weak finish of the home team, a brilliant <0xC4><0x8C>ech's and the hero of the day Jira<0xC4><0x8D>ek in Montenegro, and has thus redeemed their ticket for the European Football Championship.
Also, due to the precise defense game of the Czech team, they were able to put more pressure on the Montenegrins only in the second half.
The bad birds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who fired two giant chances.
Also thanks to the excellent Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech selection will join the European Championships next year, it is also pleased that a premium of about 200 million will be awarded to domestic football.
From the first few minutes, football was played quite a fighter.
Both teams combined for a long time and thus was mainly played around the middle line.
Also in the second half, the pressure of the home team remained, and the large blows to the prison room were successfully defused by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred college students formed a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country’s nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed before the facility on Tuesday at noon and then announced the death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students at the University of Isfahan in Iran formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is being processed.
They wanted to make sure that they were ready to protect the core program of their country, if necessary, even with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran has apparently not given up on nuclear weapons in the long run.
There is also talk in Israel of a possible attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon before entering the complex and then announced the death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an intentional attack to largely halt Iran’s nuclear program, the Israeli press from the center in Isfahan said the nuclear enrichment facility would also be NATO’s target.
The menu of an obese child: It does not eat breakfast and eats for dinner sausage
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important for a person’s healthy development is the environment in which he grows and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half as often on the table as in families where normal children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had potatoes for dinner on the eve of the education campaign under the motto "obesity is not a coincidence".
In families with obesity, sport is not exactly one of their favorite occupations, however, as is also the majority of today’s students – only 15 percent answered that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic being surveyed.
This was already the second year of the campaign "Obesity is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Insurance Fund and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12,000 students from 4th and 8th grades participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the horribly increasing number of overweight or even obese children.
"Only half of the children surveyed, for example, led to eating breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-veesper-dinner bread five times a day - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner bread
Experts point out that relatively small amounts, such as the family’s regular breakfast time, are also important for a child’s healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students’ families have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone eats breakfast on their own.
The worst thing was the finding that one in every 10 families is not breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered the basis of a healthy daily diet.
The survey showed, among other things, that in the families of overweight children, unhealthy potatoes are consumed much more often.
And almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
While more than 40 percent of children surveyed do sports, only less than half of their parents do so – only 15 percent.
Set up your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make their own meal plan out of the options offered, according to their appetite and opinion.
“What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in point diet is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many flour dishes, meat dishes and, of course, sweet dishes.
"It is especially alarming the great popularity of sweet lemonades," the final report on this survey stresses.
At lunch, the main dish, teigwaren beat just before poultry.
The children almost did not like shellfish and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Back to Healthcare
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In the control group of respondents who completed the questionnaire after the conclusion of the clarifying lecture "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was in many cases a clear shift in preferences towards principles of healthy eating", is mentioned in the results of the project.
For example, this was the case with the sweet limos, where many children began to give preference to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed much more often chicken or fish as the main dish of the day and were ready to eat less noodles or sweet food.
Pros claim - a stylist also needs to be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how to learn stylists, I had tasted a bit that it was a bit too much fabric for the beginning.
I had no idea what was yet to come.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the pitch" runs.
It's gonna get worse.
The closer we go to the exam, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still full.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (no single man takes part in the course) how to attract a woman who has no ideally proportioned figure.
And that is what most of us are after all.
Some have a too short neck, others have a too young figure without proper curves, and others are moldy.
It is a matter of the stylist to visually cashew wide shoulders, extend the neck or highlight the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with big bust, wide hips and narrow waist - beautifully and figuratively without being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between the waist and hips is so large that the skirt or pants really don’t fit, you should be able to cut at least one piece to measure.
You won’t regret that, because well-seated clothes are simply inexpensive.
In fact, in such a tailored skirt, one feels much better than in one of the rods, which is always too high and slippery, in the waist, etc.
Young figures can, in turn, afford to wear clothing with wrinkles, bows, applications, embroidery or rags.
With this amount of information and figures, I am happy that I have a whole week to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I am afraid that, given the task at hand, it is almost impossible to do.
In fact, each of the course participants was awarded a promo, for which they should think of suitable outfits - daywear and evening outfits.
In doing so, we should consider the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its type of figure.
I'm going to "dress" Miranda Kerr, whom you might know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside, I’m glad, because it’s much better for me personally than, for example, to dress up Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who’s probably gotten to the hundred kilos lately (well, that’s a bit too much), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We are going to cut out the clothes from magazines or search, print out and then edit them graphically.
In the "moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship with the graphic design will be expressed.
In fact, it is very important to also think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only physically attracts the models, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to concrete specifications, e.g. trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The designer and stylist Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overview.
The Saturday speech, filled with information about figure types, was spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And skilled stylist can work in very different ways with a single piece of clothing.
The word magic means variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual over the jeans, such as a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear footwear and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to slip up the sleeves or collar and the whole look is completely different.
"Play it," he stressed.
But most of all, the advice came to me: “First you need to know the rules perfectly.”
"It's only then you can hurt her," Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we have to pause all these teachings, what we can combine with what and why, even if you can often see something completely different in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you need to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (or ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also, that the clothes on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes look quite different than in reality.
With all this, you have to count on the design of the outfit.
The fact that image and style sometimes make up half of the success was confirmed by Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>.
All you need to do is look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, who has made image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Also known personalities often consider this to be money thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something as I look second-class).
And if one of us already gets styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely force us to a completely different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you just need to google to find out for sure that the boulevard press writes, the corresponding promi has returned or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario put our hearts on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "assemble" the outfit.
In his work, he must primarily communicate with the people he stylts and he must be a mere psychologist.
Assess people without bowing down and standing in his opinion.
"If a manager orders us to look at her wardrobe and add some nice pieces, then we can't clear the entire wardrobe and say, 'Oh, my God, that's terrible.'
“You have to find at least some praiseworthy things to recommend what you can wear for it,” says Mario.
He also showed us quite concretely what a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So such a bag that you can tap on the waist and carry all the necessary properties with you.
In addition to clear things, such as scissors, hair removal rollers or safety needles, it also contains tools, such as a nylon thread (that helps the stylist to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips, with which the clothes are stitched under the back of the scissors, with which the scissors are stitched and the clothes are stitched.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly glue shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe sole, not to mention the outside.
We o glued and glued...
With the scissors, you should not even touch the shoes so that you do not damage them.
So you really need to move forward.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without limitations.
The aforementioned skill is not exactly my strength.
All of this was just a fraction of what we heard at the second weekend follow-up course.
One thing has now become clear to me - to dedicate yourself to styling at a professional level is not a children’s game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Rezension
The initially careless ride becomes a complete avoidable, dilettante mistake for the routine ride to the early stages.
It was able to meet the ambitions for the most part, but what is the use of it if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the store, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
However, he promised to move the already aged game series "Need for Speed" to a new dimension again, and in the playable demonstration examples he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious as to how the adapted passages came out, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and goes on foot.
But, as you’re used to with NFS, in the end, it’s a lot different than you expected.
Sure - potentially there are quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is shrunk by some superfluous mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So it's actually no longer a mistake, but rather a sign of an incomprehensible flaw of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, one is introduced to the story, whose main character Jack has certain personal problems; the only solution seems to be to take part in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, so on the west coast, you get on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race will take place on a different track and that the individual stages will take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don’t have the impression that the game would offer the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are still clearly beautiful, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing moving around the world.
But driving through the desert, through autumnal landscape or high through deep snowy landscape looks visually very pleasant.
From time to time, untypical elements bring a bit of variation into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts vision.
In the mountains, you have to be careful not to be spoiled by a lavender.
At the same time, the individual races are built quite well behind each other.
Just a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overcome the required number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classical race against the stopwatch), then wait for another personal duel with a single counterpart.
And that's what the police are doing, trying to fool one of them.
A novelty are the passages in which Jack leaves the car.
Rather, it’s about certain interactive animations where Jack runs away from someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
So, nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer such passages in the game than you would expect (only three in particular).
Ultimately, this is more of an advantage, because this element has at least no chance of getting bored - it belongs to the elements that make the game more diverse in the context of the above mentioned.
The driving model walks in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today’s point of view, it doesn’t tear down trees, on the other hand, one could not claim that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you need to look elsewhere.
But an action-packed race will continue to be fairly well suited to the local driving model, even though it could be found better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in good order.
Real problems only appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not entirely OK.
It is hardly expected from a game of this kind that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea before any impact on an object, how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: In some places, you "strip" the other car, but in other, almost identical situations, you get into slippery slopes and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the carriage goes straight to rubbish.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn’t matter any more, it’s annoying every time.
The restarts are solved as follows: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then one throws the game back to the last stop of the track.
Only - in each race you have only five restarts.
Once you've exhausted it, everything goes from the front.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something fails, but you should not rely on them.
Sometimes, however, the restart doesn’t even help, as nothing else helps but to learn the critical section from the head.
It is unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some curves need to be passed in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.
In other places, you will always encounter "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see the counterpart passing by in front of a playful two-entry cars, but until you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to overdrive or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, everything is designed so that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The counterparties have other advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always outdated by the same opponent in the same place and again here, regardless of the time.
The most insane is the end of the game on the long bridge, which happens in the opposite direction.
The counterparty has to get one out of here, obviously on the devil.
And when he’s in front of one, he naturally takes a view, so you drive your own car there a few times at first.
Clear - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly misses the joy of the game.
And that’s a shame, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is generally quite entertaining and sometimes so action-laden that you almost no longer know where one of the heads are.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "blame" is about it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also to change cars during the course of the race.
You should not overlook the petrol stations on the route, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you just have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical rides, for example on the Serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the game history mode also goes to task mode (challenges) - i.e. the races in the individual locations that you know from the story.
Here there are not only medals, but also points of experience for your own profile, which is common to the tasks (challenges) and history.
To get to the higher level of the driver, different items must be unlocked: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time associated with the online autolog feature, which compares the results obtained, among other things, with those of other players, and also provides other collective features.
One of the other incomprehensible snipers is a situation in the last race of history.
This is where you can get into a subway tunnel (meineways) by car, where you can rest on the rails in the dark (meineways).
On the Tacho look figures between 150 and 200 km/h (meanways), but there comes at once a subway from the rear and drives an uncompromising scrap.
In our editorial, we will probably argue for a long time whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is not overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and here and there and even brilliant.
What’s even more annoying is that in some exciting moments the image recovery frequency slows down, and sometimes this is quite dramatic.
However, this is particularly true for accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS is useless anyway.
The sound playback is ok and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to address as wide a scale as possible to a young audience, a soundtrack was created "from everyone something" - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The emotions are rather mixed.
If the game hadn’t been shrunk by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned, we would have been able to claim with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that’s how the game seems unfinished.
It’s a great pleasure for you, but you should be prepared to face these mistakes with the power of airport headlights.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for negativists and eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance between the individual institutions tangibly out of the lot."
I wouldn’t have expected such a hard war to burn out.”
"It will take five to six years for the wolves to smooth and all of them to get used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
In the first part of her lecture, she pointed out how seriously she takes the motto "Comprehensible and open about Europe", in which she succeeded in describing in such a clear and comprehensible way the individual bodies of the EU and their relations with each other, that they could thus bend some readership of the judiciary.
Ms Vicenová also commended the new Permanent President of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, there was criticism that he was too insensitive - a grey official who had not grown up in such a role, but I must say it has breathed out to everyone how well he accepted the matter.
“He is a person who is ready to patiently listen to twenty-seven Member States to communicate with them and who has a clear idea of how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it in response to the question: who is this really - the European Union? What number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards the unification and better readability of EU policies towards countries such as India or China.
No one wants to ban us from our oil scrubbers
Mrs Vicenová also dedicated herself to the agenda, according to which the European Union lived, lives and remembers to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago was described as a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the presidency was described as a major negative, which greatly damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has to do everything in its power.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was quite hectic not only in the Presidency but also in the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome.
And the EU's seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which makes it much more complicated precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and budgetary budget, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be more and which countries will be less promoted - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Comprehensible about Europe".
“If I don’t like something, it’s horrible shortcuts, foreign words and expert jargon that no one understands.
How do I know, as a citizen, whether you really think of currants or round cucumbers and various large bananas in Brussels, or if someone really wants to ban us from quarks?
She would have liked to use EU soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in perspective
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called to be Eurosceptics, who are more of the negative than the positive sides of the matter perceive.
Even more annoying is the weak representation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
This is due to many factors, including the retention of our candidates, their inability to write letters of motivation and, not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is near me, then the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is this your V4 again?' and makes a pretty acidic mine.
According to Mrs Vicenové, the EU expects in the future, above all, tough rules for Member States' budgetary policies.
As much more real than a "European federation", it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
“For the first time, it has been said that only those countries that want it to work together and those who don’t want it to stay quietly away.”
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately leads to a strong 'Europe of different speeds'," Mrs Vicenová expects.
In this regard, she also respected the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues having an impact on the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a word that best characterizes IBM’s strategy, this would probably be the word “long life.”
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, known as a modern company, although it has been a century since its founding.
The foundation for this longevity was already laid by her first boss – the visionary Thomas J. Watson.
Already he represented the slogan, countless problems around the world were easily solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became a trademark for the life of the future giant (and at the same time for the title of the corporate magazine, which was first published by IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen’s well-prepared corporate culture.
“For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous move towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a whole century because it has remained true to its principles and was not afraid to change everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society in the course of our first century.
We hope to do even more in the next 100 years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
Thoughtful system
Watson was already operating the social care of his employees in the 1930s - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Ba<0xC5><0x82>a in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had been one of the first American employees to pay off holidays, an insurance system through the entrepreneur a loan and an elegant uniform for work.
IBM’s long-term relationship with its customers is equally sophisticated.
The company was brilliant in talent promotion from the outset – as one of the first companies in the world to raise any discrimination – and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan to replace Palmisan at the top of IBM next year is a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years and has so far held the position of Head of Business, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Its unshakable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image both inside and outside.
“From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company,” said Economist, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be only present in the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - named in the states of its logo because of its familiar "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies of all time – IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product range – from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM holds the most patents and five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
Its best known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swap, barcode or even the diskette.
With about <0x24>220 billion in stock value (market capitalization), IBM was the second-largest technology company (right after Apple) this year, outperforming Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today’s customers – unfortunately, for example, the attempt with their own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or even the IBM PC Jr. computers.
“Business is based on forward movement, so you must not be emotionally tied to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM doesn’t have a problem building its foundation walls on different platforms – and if they don’t work, leave them again.
Unlike the counter-player Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
Promising Technologies
IBM’s winnings are largely shared by services, software and hardware, and one-fifth of them are involved.
In 1990, hardware with a share of more than fifty percent was the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-making assets worth <0x24>15 billion, but at the same time invested <0x24>58 billion in buying future-oriented technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time sparked a storm over the world.
Here too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investments in the midst of the great global economic crisis.
So far, IBM seems to be overcoming today’s crisis unharmed.
The value of IBM’s shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008, and the company’s net profit is continuously growing.
IBM’s corporate slogan is: everything can change – only the values can’t.
This is why it is expected that this flexible giant will also be able to cope with the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to World Flies
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago and was originally called Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM only in 1924 - originally a trademark designation for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later IBM company was the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the famous card clocks for recording the beginning and end of the work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also held the chairmanship of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired Thomas J. Watson, the head of the competition firm, to help him run the company.
This leader even put the founders of IBM in the shadows – based on Watson’s ideas to this day, the company’s invincible culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name implies, started with the manufacture and distribution of all kinds of machines for the trade - from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled his sales to <0x24>9 million and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so essential to the company that he was in the chair for forty years, only then he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM’s technicians and computers helped direct NASA’s flights to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 the famous man’s flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which defined the computer standard of the time, came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business of high-value consulting and services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the past three years is the concept of “Smart Planet”.
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned so far, e.g. to improve the situation in traffic and urban administration.
In the trading sector, IBM recently launched the “Smart Commerce” platform to help traders lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM established a branch in then Czechoslovakia – as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe headquarters is located in Prague and there is also a world-class research team that deals with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová about her unfaithful friends:
Iveta - you can keep this ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (53) became their lover by the protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová (45), Darina still kept the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of her life she has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," explained D. Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová.
When Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová, the singer I. Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová, had offered refuge in her own house, she would not have even fallen into a dream, as it was with her husband.
When Iveta moved back and forth to <0xC5><0x98>í<0xC4><0x8D>any after 30 days, Joseph went with her.
He knew publicly that he loved her.
With time, Darina resigned, yes, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychytá<0xC5><0x99> no matter who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová is to leave in the future, then he will certainly not be welcomed open arms at home.
“He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out.”
"But not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man to whom I still have certain ties," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová said; but she also said that she had already separated herself emotionally from him and consisted solely of mutual decency.
The fact that Darina locked him in the back door, Joseph bears with dignity so far.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta, nothing will change."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I'm shopping."
"I have a normal conversation with Darina, but we just don't share the bed," said J. Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to stop her.
“We don’t sleep with each other, so I don’t care if she has a friend or who she is.
I understand that it is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I assume any responsibility.
The Worst Female Legends: What About You?
When men are asked to name some typical female prostitutes, they shake some promptly out of the sleeve without exception.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we pass a few unsettled magazines again, which let the men shed blood in the veins?
Purchasing
Is your boyfriend pretending to be addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one hat every week?
Do you like to go shopping and can there be a bit more when it comes to promotions?
In your case, it’s probably a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping desire halfway under control.
But hand to heart, which woman can’t stand looking for a well-seated outfit just that way to bump through a clothing store and not try all the same (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how many times you have told your husband - you'd rather stay outside...
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
“I had to lose at least five pounds – should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?”
"Do you like me at all?"
Is that something familiar to them?
- Yeah?
Then you probably also belong to the women who are really obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn’t mean you should let go for a long time, but many men are allergic to it when their wife constantly complains about her appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with the increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming increasingly intolerable.
Cleanliness and order in the first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, rub the bathtubs - and this at least twice a week.
Smile with her partner, because he is again stepping on the clean tiles with dirty shoes, smiling the children, because the just stitched washbasin is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room closet has fingerprints again, where polishing makes so much trouble?
If you suffer from this type of "deviation", then you should know that you must not exaggerate anything and order and cleanliness in family life do not come first.
This measure of purity can ultimately also damage mutual relationships and, above all, the tranquility in the family.
Sticheln
"The dirty pants come in the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to wear the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that that brings him to the palm.
Of course, that’s not bad, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew it, then the women might not need to suck so much.
Klatsch and Tratsch
Some women like to crawl and shake, then they are bent on their backs or even insulted or they are forged alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, which is why they like to explore topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably each of us women have a little harmless crap and crap on stock.
Hand on heart - this is probably the case for all women.
But this is not to be confused with clashers of the highest caliber, to whom nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their surroundings and who pose a significant danger especially to women’s collectives.
Jágr and Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek defeat Philadelphia with their victory assists
Ice hockey storm Jaromír Jágr took a big part in the NHL Monday's match with two assists in Philadelphia's 5:3 win on the Carolina ice, making him again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux benefited from the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star, who added assistance and was named the best player of the match.
Jágr's co-player Jakub Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek also scored two assists in the same game.
After the game, Jágr claimed to journalists that Giroux had a great evening of prophecy.
"Even before the game, I tell him he's got a hat trick today."
I felt that in a way.”
"There's this feeling over and over again," Jágr said, after which Giroux scored a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech trail".
Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek fought the Puck behind the Hurricane Gate and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first-third kick off, homer Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hander, but the second-third then again belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds led his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league, but he’s definitely one of the top three,” Jágr said.
“I wouldn’t have known that I would play with an ice hockey player like him at the end of my career.”
"I'm very happy."
"I'm cutting my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL, my teammates put their game on me and now the spike turns around," said Jágr.
Carolina made the game into a drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who stood out from a penalty shootout, came to a gate.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was in excess of two against one.
"Excellent progeny still in our zone."
"He showed the puck, I took the ride and (read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last match from his perspective.
With this victory, Philadelphia was at the forefront of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal's Czech defender Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek was injured in the match against Buffalo and shot out in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candiens also scored an unlost lead in the penalty shootout 2:3.
One of the penalties could not transform Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec.
More than the lost points hurt the coach of the home team the high disease-related failure in the defensive - they only played with five defenders at the end.
"That's bad."
"We only played the match with one experienced player at the end, the rest were young players."
“But there’s nothing that can be done, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
"At each shift, one wave after the other, and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and put the puck out of our thirds."
There were reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and contributed significantly to the 5:2 win over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, there were five different shooters.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in the then <0xC4><0x8C>SSR: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
At that time, the travel agencies were selling only travel to the socialist Eastern bloc countries, in the West they were allowed to choose only.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean Peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when you were also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that even the citizens of the Eastern bloc (i.e. the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely within the socialist countries.
If a citizen of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSR, for example, wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter to do so, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Already at that time, the travel agencies also offered to travel to the West, but then you had to buy huge snakes or even stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good friends" in the travel agency.
Even so, the thing hadn't worked out for a long time.
The so-called currency statement - the condition for a trip to the West - was only given to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
In fact, the Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible without currency statements to leverage the necessary financial means (western currency) for a trip to the West.
Therefore, the vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend homes and datches - a habit that continues to this day.
The harmonious revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While vacations in the DDR or Bulgaria were the measure of all things until 1989, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, of which one is no longer aware today, is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular holiday country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 at all, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, the currency obligation was lifted in the neighbouring Western European countries, resulting in a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks simply could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
For example, when traveling to Paris, Czech vacationers slept in the tent in the park, because who would have already had the money for accommodation in a hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature of travel abroad from the Czech Republic at the time was a luggage compartment packed with canned, beer and permanent wurst, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and, as a result, the average wages increased, which ended in another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, after 1997, travel agencies began to regularly prepare for charter flights, making air travel, thanks to the possibility of negotiating quantity discounts, incredibly cheaper compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already exchange-free payments with all the highly developed countries in the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-town" travel came in 2000, when thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers fly annually to distant sunny countries; this year, twelve exotic destinations are flying directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the era, which marked our “post-revolutionary” development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitively one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holiday abroad for the first time (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than CZK 15 tsd. per person for a single holiday.
The General Assembly is expected to find a new chairman - again a patt is threatening.
For almost five months now, Czech football has no chairman and threatens that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek’s successor at the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is still no consensus on which electoral order to be elected.
And without these, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík.
In June, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned from his position, urging his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the old intersections between the two chambers broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This proved clear and clear on September 16, when the new president should be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the People’s House in Prague’s Smíchov district for no results, and this was not just about the election itself.
In fact, one could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the Assembly - only the statutory representatives or even the officials equipped with an authority.
In this single point, at least partial agreement was reached, which also contributed to the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, which in its view did not hold a representation on the basis of power.
However, the dispute over the electoral order continues.
The Executive Committee did not bring any more clarity on the matter at its meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda at all.
Although the perceptions regarding the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid a patt situation?
"The point of the dispute concerns whether to proceed in accordance with the Statute, or whether to find a completely different model," said Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairmen of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the larger percentage support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Mars is allegedly ready to enter into the compromise that the candidate who gets the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least two-thirds majority in this percentage count.
"Then the two rounds have no sense at all, this mode would question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moroccan side, who find it best not to bend the electoral order, but to vote according to the current statute.
Surprisingly, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík also agrees with this, although it turns out that the statutory election order is most likely to be met by Pelta from all candidates.
"My wish is that most of them be elected according to the Statute."
"So that no nonsense substitutes are devised, as in the last general meeting," said owner (of the football club) Victoria Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who for the first time nominated and delimited himself in his opinions especially to Pelta.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new president will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for today's European football would surely help to calm the minds."
"If football is only riding on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience of all three adepts, both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope to reach an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is biased."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moors, but there are certain efforts to 'turn the rules' for their own purposes."
"That is why a new blockade at the General Assembly is not excluded."
"However, I hope that the common sense will ultimately win," Rajchl said.
Just - a lot of time to agree on all sides no longer.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualifying game.
The charter aircraft, with which, among other things, Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl were supposed to fly to Podgorica, was not able to start in the morning in Prague due to a technical disruption, so a feverish search was made for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the Executive Committee to the place of departure of the bargain.
In the end, the meeting at the ministerial level, which is supposed to be held on Wednesday, is decisive.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, the Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to move the divided parties within the country’s largest sports association to agree.
There is a lot at stake: state grants, the credibility of Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV, which is supposed to show the Czech sport the new direction after Sazka’s financial problems.
Paclík is in the fight for the position of president because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers before the extraordinary general meeting, had been able to form a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not have assumed this position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl is therefore to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Paclík also stresses that in the event of his victory, he will only remember to serve as chairman for one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the regular general meeting.
In the position of chairman he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football events.
“I’ve talked to some people in question in person.”
“I can’t believe that some people told me they didn’t want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly disrupts Pelta’s connection with the chairman of the Pilsner district football association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to hold delegate votes at major gatherings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paclík to have Pelta in the position of chairman.
"With his victory, the present condition would be preserved and in Czech football it would not go any further."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, got football twice as bad," Paclík said.
This also means that Pelta's name was recently linked to phone interviews in an investigation into a corruption case, but that Pelta emerged without penalties.
"I don't know what prestige a victory from Pelta should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who said his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman", but he already sees something more relaxed.
If Paclík wins in Thursday’s election, he can imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the general meeting in October, thinks the same way, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities".
“I could imagine him as the head of the national team.
“But I don’t think he’s able to run the association as a manager.”
"I'm not sticking my nose to matters that I don't understand," said Paclík, who in September had given notice that he was behind the cancellation of the arbitration commission with Lu<0xC4><0x91>ek Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims he feels the role of the chairman of the association has grown.
And he relies on his skills in managing private companies, since last summer he is also the boss of Pilsen, who with his support in May celebrated the first triumph in the league.
“I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it.”
"In order to limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence disciplinary and vocational commissions, which can be detrimental to situations," said Paclík, who has no hesitation from his antipathy towards the Sparta Chief Daniel K<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>e.
As one of his priorities, he sees the strengthening of relations between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby among the top politicians for more money flowing from the lottery tax into the sport.
"This is one of the decisive things that the new president should devote to."
“When it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they also need to say clearly where the money is going,” he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club is also not seen by Paclík as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R must be "partial".
Pelta is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"But in my opinion it doesn't make much sense to seemingly transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person to return after a year and a half," Paclík explained.
Pelta promised new statements of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R that would rule out a Patt situation in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the chairmanship, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election, he would work hard to ensure that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will receive new statutes, which in the future will have disputes over the electoral order of the former.
The official from Jablonec is confident before Thursday’s negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly derail itself in the event of a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealised election in September that he would focus on the national team and the extraction of funds in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting, so the two-month break could help him defend his ideas about the leadership of football and present it in a wider context.
"People at all levels are passionate about football, they are impatient and therefore expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels it's time for the association to be led by someone," said the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonecer club, but who also acted for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
That’s why he thinks he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed in the days of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is responsible for today’s problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, sentences were approved at the General Assembly in June that were not as perfect as everyone had accepted.
If they hadn’t allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September onwards,” Pelta said.
It was the revision of the most important document of the Citizens' Association that he used as a means of locking the delegates.
"If I'm going to be president, I'll take it personally and I'm willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn't work out."
"That's a principled thing without which he can't be," Pelta claims.
In addition, he does not try to delimit himself with his counterparts.
Already earlier he had announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, which he recognized for his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first substitute.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík did not attack him for a long time, leaving no dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he has been moving for over a year and can already refer to some successes.”
“But his attacks were declining and many people were shocked by his election campaign.”
“That’s why many are now doubting his true character,” Pelta said to his counterpart, who is likely to remain faithful to his proclamations, which he had already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his most powerful weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest playing classes to the national team.
And this should be the hanging sign of Czech football.
“I would also endeavor to end all affairs – from the Bohemian cause to the continuation of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"Right after that, I would go on negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure sufficient funding for the entire football," said the forty-six-year-old <0xC4><0x8C>TK candidate two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean personal cleansing.
"I had to first get acquainted with the work content of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, nervousness is understood.
Despite the disastrous scenarios that accompany the upcoming General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If the only controversy is how to choose in the third round, then we'll get over it."
“Football needs credibility and it only wins back if it finally has a new leader,” Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will start working hard under him
If the former vice-president Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl was to be elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association at the general meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly confuse many people in the association.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that former president Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has begun.
“As president, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole.”
Starting from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, through national selection, professional football, to performance football for youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I am a team player and therefore I want to distribute the competencies on the Executive Committee so that each member is dedicated to a certain area.”
And I'm going to allocate hard tasks to keep football moving forward in every segment with milestones."
Many would not be pleased about it right now, because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would now have to start working really hard themselves,” he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement has considered not to run at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know that it makes sense and that people behind me who don’t inevitably throw a button between my legs and question every step I take,” he said as an explanation of why he delayed.
“But many people told me that I shouldn’t give up because other people would do it too.”
"That's trust that you can't play," he said.
He is also said to be motivated to continue the work he started under Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“In two years, we’ve done a lot of work and I don’t want to just throw it away.”
"Processes have been started that probably only come into effect in a few years and I would just hate to see it stop someone," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta could choose the situation back in the pre-Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek era.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
“Behind him are people who would make football so that he would be there only for the chosen ones.”
I can argue with one thing, but not that I’m a party.”
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone will be fine and not just the chosen," Rajchl noted.
He also opposes the claim that he is only a Czech president.
“Although some people claim the opposite, I really plan to do the best for mowers.”
"For example, it's time to consider whether to divide the league into a Czech and a Moroccan part, the winners of which will then rise to the first league."
"Then it wouldn't be possible that today only three clubs will play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in the marathon," Rajchl said.
Now that the head of the Pilsner Club Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík has also joined the fight for the function of chairman, Rajchl did not trust to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its deputy chairman, and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl, who also led the savings of zig million kroner as a result of his unfavourable contracts, and the settlement of the contracts.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part for the fact that the association does not pull on a single strand.
While von Pelta says "he is disqualified from the start to help Czech football gain new confidence," he thinks the second rival - Paclík is a strong candidate who really has something to offer football.
“No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year.”
"If he was to be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has initiated, and he would obviously not fundamentally change the staffing in the commissions as well."
He would certainly not want to turn things in his favor,” Rajchl said of his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
by Julia Stanek
Planschbecken in UFO optics, Prunkpools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience your blue wonder – and after a city tour or hike you can rest your tired legs in Sprudelbaths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past one and a half years, one thing was not to be missed in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Sitting back on the water, she looked up in artfully designed domes, she swam against marble pits waiting for her at the pond edge, and marveled at acreibly restored youth-style swimming halls.
She liked a bath, she recorded it flying in her notebook - along with interesting details about the structure and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architecture historian Meder in this way - and now introduces her in her recently published book "Swimming pleasures": folk swimming halls in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete builders" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Serbia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sports she doesn’t have much on her hat, says Meder – just in the water it’s different.
Annoying only that swimmers have to find themselves with blue tiles and chloride tank, while joggers can breathe the disturbing smell of pine forests or hear the cheerful bird whistle in the park.
“I was wondering one day why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water Surface Doubles Architecture
Platters in the jumping pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in the baths is so large because all the senses are served, so Meder.
And when the builders have struggled, swimming halls can be a real eyelash: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: high waves, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
On 190 pages, the informative band "Badefreuden" conveys interesting information about the architectural and cultural history of historic wellness oases - but above all, it makes a leap into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by the pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-like water in a rugged carst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose pools are filled with alkali-containing water and are located in a flask-shaped building.
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in mind from the Zurich rooftop bath, you can look at the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton on the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam bath there is a window on which you can see the slopes.
The perhaps most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aquadome <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO landed just in the Alps.
From three open shells up it steams in the winter, while in the background the mountains of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal rag into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder got into the nose of the smell of chlorine.
Many thermal baths smell sulphur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rpád bath in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells so badly of heating oil that it is hardly believed to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and its slick sticks to one on the skin as soon as you can slide into the pelvis - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing pool in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found an enclosed terrain.
The bathroom, designed in 1902 by the architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic, has now been closed.
As Meder glanced through the winding windows of the red-white-yellow youth-style building, she saw weeds sprout between the tiles.
On the other hand, the decline has been counteracted in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction are already behind this bath; you can discover not only neo-Roman elements dating from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the meticulous modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite swimming pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because it originally comes from the Black Forest.
"It's already an achievement to merge so many different building styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
In such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a by-product.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank Lets Raw Materials Business Light Up
by Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the CEO will have consequences.
Hamburg - Hamburg
For the Germans, it is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn speculate.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions leave the business because it exacerbates the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that betting on the global commodity exchanges drives prices upwards – and therefore banks carry a co-debtedness to the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were designed to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, most experts agree that the sweets have decoupled from supply and demand – and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said no business was "worthy of putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year the examination is to be completed, then the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank - with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the head of the bank will then tell you what consequences it will have.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even a complete decline.
Farmer bassing on his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial industry: "Witnessing on rising food prices shows particularly drastic how reckless banks are harming the general welfare today."
Ackermann is now the chief bank lobbyist in a special duty.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio, where money is used for betting on food prices," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether it's Mr. Ackermann's people who are starving or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s insight is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not change to the Supervisory Board in a different way than planned.
By turning away from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible intrusions, he hardly needs to shave himself - that would eventually have to do with his successor.
One in two would cancel commodity facilities
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the survey, for which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
In particular, eleven percent consider it legitimate that the Deutsche Bank offers facilities, in which prices for food are wagered.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: one in two would cancel all investments in which money flows into raw material speculation, according to the survey.
43 percent would be aborted by acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said they would consider canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights, depths and happy ends: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 received awards, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and disappeared.
It is now being reopened as an exhibition house.
If it is warmed by modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, bold whispers and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is an example for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition.
Schwanzers Pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating glass steel construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made it known to the architects that he also built the pavilion at the next world exhibition in Austria.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus a shell-like side building in Munich, it was finally internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been set up in the Swiss garden at the Vienna South Railway Station after the world exhibition, rebuilt in 1962 and opened a museum of the 20th century - the "20th house" was called it.
However, the building was not suitable as a spacious and technical museum - no walls to hang art, no good climate.
However, it was used for as long as contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has gone down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday night, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens its first exhibition - a chance in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, has begun.
Husslein-Arco, an art historian with a notable career in her youth, later at Sotheby’s, Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, made a strong commitment to the redevelopment of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, with the help of her politicians and painters.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a cafe and a bookstore, and an office house had to be built to do so.
Strict supervision, small state
Krischanitz was then the ideal occupancy for the performance.
Not only because he had sensibly rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich’s secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an “unexpectedly important place” for him, where he had “almost every weekend” the exhibition.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which had already lost in its relocation to Vienna and its use of generosity and ease.
There were much bigger problems with the current remodeling: the building was "an energy slope," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade have been replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulating glass has been used and the glass roof has been replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two basements brought room for new use, a dimmed light excavation between house and street provides for exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red-brown rust-protection color.
And the cinema is still exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small state.
"Often it was necessary to find a material that is good and cheap and also liked the memorial office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rugged floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and remodeling, the building has remained flexible and lightweight.
It has been difficult with the pavilion, "who came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city history".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "arouse a real awareness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because there has been an urban accident: Around the Swiss garden, the completely newly planned "Mainbahnhofsquartier" is created, with office and residential buildings.
And another luck case may still occur: the 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and as you hear, it is already negotiating with the city for a neighbouring location in the Swiss garden.
Train Plans Winter Crisis Package to Millions
The railway has developed a crisis plan to prevent access failures in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related access failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn spends an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, calling for an internal crisis plan, that by 2015 investments of a total of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million were planned.
This aims to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
It is planned, among other things, to double the internal and external staff for the removal of snow on railroads and railroad climbs to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free up track climbs by the start of operation and 90 percent of the required mileage within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, Railway Chief Rüdiger Grube had warned of access failures and delays this winter after a summit with government and industry.
Last winter, the railway had significant passenger traffic problems, as it was lacking reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
Thus, many new regional trains have been awaiting approval from the Federal Railways Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been making it possible for years to have ICE train axes checked more frequently in the workshop after an ICE crashed at Cologne’s main railway station.
Deutsche Bank pays million fines in the U.S.
After the turmoil over Chief Josef Ackermann, a new unrest comes from the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for the Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is still collecting its past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute is paying <0x24>145 million (106 million euros) in comparison, to settle disputes over the plethora of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage securities.
Financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of major banks of misleading cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; they would have lowered the risks.
Such securities have lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and are breaking the banks into the depths.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," a German-bank spokesman said in New York.
The bank did not accept any debt from the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to paying <0x24>20.5 million.
NCUA chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the meeting of the two wallets.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and is taking steps to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to compensate for the billion-dollar damage.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also appealed to other major banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
This is the basis of home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble struck in 2007, this became a hefty situation for a variety of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers rebuilt.
Even though the events have been going on for a few years, the banks are now facing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed countless complaints in order to obtain compensation or to make mistakes.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It proposes 18 international large banks to have over-preferred US real estate financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at mortgage stores of around <0x24>200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to file a lawsuit against the FHFA, which deals with several transactions worth a total of <0x24>14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurters stand for "substantial losses" without specifying an exact sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as relentlessly and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett raises <0x24>10 billion at IBM
Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has acquired shares worth more than <0x24>10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he should not invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies is only poorly predicted.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s financial reports and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He has had to understand long before that IBM primarily offers services and acquires computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a knight's blow in the financial world.
As a result, the IBM IT Urgestein can now be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now revealed in CNBC that he has been buying <0x24>10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has grown to become one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM hasn’t even known anything about the engagement so far.
He praised the management, which had made good profits even in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett told the strategy.
IBM has been relying for a long time on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies to date.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Buffett, for example, joined a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer or a machine-builder.
In addition to some 80 own subsidiaries, Berkshire Hathaway also owns shares in a number of major corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich back.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
Still, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unfathomable sense of money making gave him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of Buffett’s investment, IBM’s stock initially rose by 1 percent.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also called, is worth more than <0x24>220 billion on the stock exchange, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he didn’t want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media doubts the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a “bloodful ideology” that is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish tribesmen and a Greek small businessman between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is being reacted in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
For many German Turks, a long-deadly ghost returns: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against the Turks.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany, however, was never questioned.
However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is not yet predictable.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk" headlined.
The newspaper "Sabah" on the other hand stresses that one of the perpetrators was a V-man of the constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
Besonnen responded by the Turkish municipality of Germany: she recalled the victims of racist violence on the weekend with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had planned to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In happy colors, the co-stage was staged – as a story of success.
The report of some Turkish media: "Gift of Germany to the Fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also the German edition of the "Hürriet" cannot be taken to draw this imaginary connection.
"It's starting to smell," says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid taxes and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
Extremely critical is discussed in German Internet forums the action of the police and their later success in the journey.
Why it was not much more likely for the German authorities to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Some are at least rhetorically prepared for drastic means: “If we continue to be slammed here, the migrants will have nothing left but self-defense and weapons.”
"This will probably be the best self-defense."
"From the goodness of enlightenment and the adequacy of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the inner peace in Germany", writes "Selen".
What it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger is clarifying the attacks of mills and solings in the 1990s.
The photo of the Fire Ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the we-feeling on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at the time, the failure of German politics after the attacks was largely undermined: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire of Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president, but was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in his speech the amount of taxes paid by the local Turks.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated by the amount of his taxes.
The current reporting of the Turkish media shows once again how deeply the mistrust of many German Turks has been in the local rule of law ever since.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive clarification and re-evaluation of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, it needs open words this time.
The Scandal Bank of Lake Zürich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it's supposed to be a German.
Axel Weber probably didn’t think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank in July, it was announced that he would enter a nearly equally spectacular new job in 2013: the Chairman of the Management Board of the Swiss Grossbank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was pleased publicly, commending Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidity, and making friendly comments about future colleagues.
"UBS has managed the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But in September it became clear that everything would be different.
A UBS dealer in London had circumvented all of the bank’s security systems and borrowed around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a not only famous Swiss banker, had to leave.
Since then, the president of the board of directors of UBS has also been deemed to be attacked – and all the questions are: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been announced that Weber will be able to consult the bank from February 2012.
And he will assume the chairmanship of the board of directors in May – not until 2013, the bank said on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is going to be tough.
He is not a banker, but a professor of economics and a notary banker, and would certainly have needed time to work.
With a blow, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that it has long earned the title of “Europe’s largest scandal bank”.
Because, on the one hand, the UBS is huge – until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager – and, on the other hand, has been slipping from a scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, will once remain the proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of a silent and solid Swiss asset manager, but also a well-established one, combined with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a big number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed <0x24>1.6 trillion more wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it was leading the league of the world’s largest banks.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later a long-time banking professor in Zurich, said: “I always presented the UBS to my students as a model for a good bank.”
"From today's perspective, you ask yourself, how could I just be so wrong?"
He made a huge mistake.
In 2007, it was first revealed that something related went wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who until then was considered a high-tech and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, he figured out why he was gone.
The bank’s investment side had been covered with subprime securities and had to write off billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of say and writes down 13 billion francs.
For this, she actually found investors, but which some of them would have even recently scoffed at: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so secretly hidden that it didn’t even get its name.
But that was just the first blow.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, and CEO Marcel Ospel, Switzerland’s second-best-paid CEO, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS stood in the face of its misinvestments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank purchased the UBS for zig billion of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a compulsory loan, through which it could become the co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to host such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
“We couldn’t save the UBS again,” says banking researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was joined by the second.
Just a few months later, UBS capitulated in its tax dispute with the United States and declared itself willing to issue the data of wealthy customers who may have withdrawn taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of <0x24>780 million – as a refund of unjustified profits from these transactions, along with a penalty payment.
As a result, the UBS became more or less known to have helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board.
And the exodus of customer money.
For example, within a few months the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking due to faulty speculations and in asset management due to tax evasion aid.
And just as it became a little quieter again, just as it was thought, now UBS will get it back, then this unsuccessful dealer history follows: A single dealer is attracting 1.7 billion euros before the bank notices that something is going wrong.
And it becomes obvious: Risk management in investment banking is obviously still not working.
“With the Adoboli case, it has been found that the risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial board of a large German bank is also certain: “The problem with UBS is that it does not have risk control.”
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long been the guardians of the world’s great fortunes: no too big risks, for security for money – even if the world should collapse beyond the Alps.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unmistakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the growing Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
The location is already classic.
The bank is headquartered on the Zurich railway station, which leads directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, which is surrounded by the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are stunning, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have been residing here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception room of the UBS is accessed through a heavy turning door.
Inside, the walls are covered in marble, thick leather chairs stand in front of them, next to the bank logo a large sign of "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has pushed both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point – or betrayed how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds it.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, he does business, like all Swiss bankers, with the two big banks.
The UBS has become too large, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxon axis has spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, gave it high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million-dollar country decided the largest rescue action in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros, politicians agreed to save the bank that was facing bankruptcy.
How did it come about?
Talking to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss banks merged into a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for small Switzerland when it merged - and continued to grow.
The two different predecessor banks of the UBS helped to complement each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalised.
All of a sudden, the internationalized investment bankers came in favour of a lot of money with which they could spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, the humble, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal man, who has worked from banking to the top."
But in the end, Ospel relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: “He thought his models were the reality,” says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Obviously, pride came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, at which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same motto: Goldman Sachs kicked off the throne.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank on earth.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
The UBS wanted to go up there.
A few steps had already been successful.
In foreign exchange and stock trading, she played at the top.
However, the company's advisors who were appointed highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge gap to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS ventured into an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in U.S. subprime investments.
It evolved into a huge machine that packed and passed on securities on American mortgage loans – but also retained risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for the exit.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the US real estate market was on fire, UBS bought it there," says banking expert Geiger.
So deep the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager had to go after the other, as the attempts to clean up turned out to be more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS became the seat of the slippery slope and are still wacky to this day.
The one who runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has abandoned all apparent business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: end investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far.
But investment banking is expected to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, will present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo Swiss was actually only thought of as a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has implemented: he is to permanently conduct the UBS business, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to return to its position in the mid-1990s.
3,500 jobs are cancelled.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who's she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is asking himself now.
In public, he only says that he and his wife will first look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens U.S. stock exchange
The threatening recession in Europe has taken the U.S. investors courage by the week-long pace.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
The endangered industrial production on the continent sunk hopes for a stabilization of the debt crisis in germs.
The general relief of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be implemented.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glasses were still half full last week, not half empty – but now the problems were pushed back into the foreground again, Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott said.
In particular, financial values were on the sales lists.
The Dow-Jones index of the default values scored a minus of 0.6 per cent at 12,078 points.
In the course of trading, the market barometer was between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus one percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange Index lost 0.8 percent and went out of business with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a minus of 1.2 percent for 5985 counters.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is preparing for the end of the boom.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
The U.S. investors were skeptical of this: “We are not an island, but dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get out of a recession so quickly, and there are other signs of weakness in banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
Therefore, it is too early in his view to invest in European bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle over the pile and stepped into the U.S. technology industry.
His investment of more than <0x24>10 billion in IBM supported the company’s traditional stock price and allowed it to score almost one percent higher against the trend in the course of trading at first.
The paper closed almost unchanged at <0x24>187.35.
Buffett reportedly paid an average of <0x24>170 per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The stock price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America’s shares yielded 2.6 percent more than the market.
The house pays off almost all of its remaining shares in China Construction Bank and raises <0x24>6.6 billion.
With the net profit from the business, the institution aims primarily to uphold its share of capital and thereby comply with tougher regulatory requirements.
Boeing added, thereby limiting the losses in the Dow.
The stock gained 1.5 percent after the company had collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 777 long-haul machines on Sunday and set the order's value at <0x24>18 billion.
Including options for 20 more machines, the volume is even <0x24>26 billion.
On the New York Stock Exchange, around 710 million shares were exchanged by the owner.
719 values added, 2281 gave up, and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, with sales of 1.38 billion, 630 shares in plus, 1913 in minus and 82 unchanged.
Intelligent crows spread in cities
Seed crows are considered "problem birds" in many places: but the highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from the cities, experts claim.
They like one, the others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities, residents complain about the dirt and noise of the animals.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is not in sight so far.
Seed crows will no longer be able to get out of the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian empire.
There, professionals from all over the Federal Territory advised on possible routes.
You are looking for alternatives in cities
Nature conservationists also brought the problems in cities back to the escape of the particularly protected seedlings: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing construction and the fall of typical mammal trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs are found in Westphalian forests, in the northwest, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, as well as in empty.
In 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the county had provided negative headlines.
Critics called the capture of the animals in bird traps and the slaughter with knobs particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the rape, brings nothing," said city and landscape planner Werner Klöver.
Nesting with water or falling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals softened out, large colonies split up and spread elsewhere."
Excommunication is only conceivable as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we won't get them away anymore."
Without the surrounding area, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner said.
It is conceivable that a combination of animal grazing from sensitive living areas and lockdown offers will be used to relocate them elsewhere.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different approach to the animals said: “We can finally withstand a puck in the face with self-confidence.”
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen Learning Path, where signposts inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed krähen.
The project is already being accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also criticized the noise of the birds with his own opinion: "There is a lot of communication that has a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seedlings not only use tools to get to a snack, but even make their own tools as tools.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested at four seed circles how far the intelligence of the birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that with stones they had to bring a body to collapse in order to get to a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined the size and shape of a stone needed to collide with the platform.
In a second attempt, the fictitious crows then had to solve a more crisp problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers placed a small pond with a motten larvae.
With the snap, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had put wires on them.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then squeezed the dam on the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four seed circles even succeeded in this.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championships
The hopes of Bosnians and Turks for a coup remained.
The favourites of Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are also present at the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have won the last tickets for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd) Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive European Championship match perfect after the 0:0 draw.
In the play-off match against outside Montenegro, the Czechs scored 1-0 (0:0), after the draw (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia did not burn any more by 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland scored a light 1:1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72th, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the next matches for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburger Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a changed trade meter (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had twice shortened for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the Yellow-Red Card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the play-offs of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal made a tailor-made start.
Ronaldo chased a free kick from about 30 meters to the early lead into the mesh.
A good quarter-hour later, Nani showed his wide shot qualities and hit from 25 metres to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger of English table leader Manchester City placed a headball at the bottom of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek meets for the Czech Republic
Subsequently, arbitrator Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the center.
After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penitentiary, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade mile following an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic safely transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-European Champion made it clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended his last doubts in the 81st minute.
For the fifth time in a row, the Champion of Europe will compete at the European Championships in 1976.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga-Legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to survive a horror second in the initial phase.
Finalist Petr Cech prevented a possible proprietor door by Tomas Sivok (9.) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its biggest chances when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot just past the gate of Cech in the 40th minute of the turn from the prison boundary.
After the break, the Czechs had to save the cross-country for the already beaten world-class tournament, again the stormer of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The gate just before the end finally made it clear.
In the meantime, Turkey missed the soccer wonder of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0-0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to clear his seat on the bank of the 2002 World Cup third, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in the final round.
Before 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the pole in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to sink the striker in the goal.
After the second of horror, however, Croatia increasingly took control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made his place for Dortmund Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga Legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in play.
Trapattoni is heading for the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first European Championships in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision in the 32nd minute with a 4-0 win in the back.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) equal for the guests.
Ireland pushed the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
It was only at the last moment that the Estonian rear team prevented the possible leader.
But in the 32nd minute it was so far.
After an unsuccessful defensive by finalist Pavel Londak, Ward was in the spot and pushed the ball to 1-0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software manufacturer SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around <0x24>2 billion (around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5 billion) will flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly,” Co-Chef Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from around 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of offices of the world leader in corporate software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAP customers are based in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP wants to increase its sales to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.

Mass slaughter at a personal level
Sensitively and generously, Peter Englund’s new book “Beauty and Horror: A History of the First World War, narrated in nineteen halls” begins with a long list of main characters that goes to one’s heart.
Here’s a tip how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's novel story, and these main characters will act as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments where you, like Englund's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not inadvertently describe as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few major names, important treaties or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, angry reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and scare" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less indiscriminate men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office employees.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, become crazy or die.
Each of these lives flashes up like the votive candles in a church, some add, while others extinguish.
Englund’s book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that World War I was only the devastating war of positions on the West Front.
"Beauty and horror" wanders with expert views over other war sites: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall beehives, a celebration of Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flyes are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling like Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears gunfire in the distance. Do you stay or take the flight?
Who's coming at all?
No one understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Lacking facts," says Englund, "were furnished with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipmate.
Their stories were mostly taken from memories, letters, and other material that had already been published.
Their life stories can be frightening or captivating, but they are extremely alive in englunds of the collection of little moments that are lost in detail.
Many of them act out of lack and self-help.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, replacement everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake radier rubber, paper compounds, wooden buttons."
He talks more about replacement food in Germany.
He describes "meat made of pressed rice and baked in ham fat (and most recently served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes coated with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of spices, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for wildlife and says of the war: "You feel that this is, after all, what was intended for men rather than sitting in a loan chair, with the evening newspaper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in your hand, and so to do as if it were not meant to be a bar and a gaitful of such a fassss."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and no one will take note of it or take care of it.
“When you distance yourself from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience,” he writes.
Instead, it is as awful as “a convicted man who was secretly hanged.”
Other observations are about the old Europe that is falling apart, and about new forms of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the beastrium of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a mass suit that slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to contact a prostitute with a sexual illness in order to escape the front service.
“The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade of gonococcal eggs, because soldiers bought and lubricated themselves on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital,” he writes.
"Those who were really desperate were staring him into the eyes, which led to them being blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes smooth and yet immovable and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "discovered uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are leading them to fight.
The best books about World War I were mostly fake, such as Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques' "Nothing New in the West" rather than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I’ve ever read in a book.
I'm not giving it anymore.
But it is as if he had caught us with his book this page with the main characters in front of his nose and ignited it with a stick.
After an early failure, a minutiously planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing helmets.
It was decided for the night from Monday to Tuesday because at this time there were hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed. All the others initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the Desert and gave homeowners a huge increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by observing how the occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training—measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers—to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came "at the last minute," someone familiar with the orders said, which was a statement called "exercise".
“The few police officers involved, as I know, didn’t know it was about Zuccotti Park,” someone who wanted to remain anonymous said.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the resort."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then retreated, when hundreds of protesters gathered after they learned of these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including commandoes from across the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are usually employed in high-criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people enter and leave the park, almost like pedestrians, so 1 o'clock at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people are staying in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and speakers were ready before the departure at the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages swirling from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When public officials in their light blue wind jackets entered the park, many protesters simply racked up their belongings and left the place.
Police said no tents would be opened until 1:45 p.m. to give the protesters time to pack their possessions and property together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene, should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said this happened for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to keep her from watching the police actions in the park, and they said the officers' dealings were very rough.
Mr. Browne said television cars on Church Street could have taken pictures on the west side of the park.
When the police moved westwards due to the large turmoil of the protesters’ personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial roads and bags of clothes, their city cleaning staff followed up with what had been left behind.
Some protesters, who refused to go, were dragged outside, and pictures of it appeared on the internet shortly afterwards.
A main core of protesters referred to the position near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some barriers were erected and the police continued their methodological arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp bonded to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Disaster Protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 p.m.
The cleanup was completed after 75 minutes, according to the police.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were, as he said, due to "untaxable conduct and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent on-site official was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officer of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Criminal Officers Department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "didn't lead the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials awaited on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It was observed that from these locations the police continued to expand the area around Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them with shields, were observed driving people out.
Approximately 28 people were in the northern district.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 p.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters left the air out of the tyre of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of scissor wood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
The union of caregivers will file a lawsuit against the city for dismissal
The union, representing hundreds of school administrators who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday as the dismissals due to their inappropriate influence on schools that teach poor students are not necessary and discriminatory.
The lawsuit is probably the last option that the trade union, the District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other employees, who were among the city’s worst-paid employees and lost their jobs in a draw on October 7, should have described the union leader as a political revenge by describing that in the past year, with the help of the house, the people who were employed in the city, the people who had lost their jobs in a chess train.
These allegations were categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a town council hearing, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said last month that the dismissals were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the city council shot back and told him that nothing in the budget specifies that the school staff would be fired.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education of a lawsuit, and on Wednesday there will be a press conference announcing the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the City’s Ministry of Education as defendants and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colorful or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Justice Department, said the city did not file the lawsuit and therefore its individual allegations could not be commented on.
According to a draft lawsuit filed by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of dismissals in schools in the poorer districts of the city to support a lawsuit for inequality, claiming that poor schools had lost more helpers because they were chronically finer.
It explains that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and only a few layoffs in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 assistants in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were dismissed.
With the finding of the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed in public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: "This is not a neighborhood of bullied parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and funds were lost as the city changed its method of calculating the extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the leaders of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" in the U.S. usually describes a teacher's shift from a school's salary list to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators have been fired, not handed over," the draft lawsuit says.
Mission ended, congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington already have an understanding of the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed to do this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's Committee on International Relations decided a resolution that supports President John Kerry (Massachusetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), calling for Libya's "successful rebellion" and for the United States.
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House disputed the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or disapproval the role of the U.S. military in the Libyan mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution that approved the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a wide marginal group of both parties and there was no vote.
But the same day, the law passed in the Senate, and the House voted on a decision to cut the funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission went into some sort of legislative firing—with a Congress that was angry enough to criticize Obama’s approach as part of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was outdated by the events.
Tripolis fell under Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations “congratulations to the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-release” and “honores the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who are engaged in military operations to protect the people of Libya, except for their professions.”
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Board or will they split the legislators, as the June Act did?
The last version encounters the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the Committee's top Republican.
Lugar’s spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
It is up to the Senate this week to vote on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional legislature of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area to be voted on in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far unsuccessfully tried to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have tried enough often.
Goodlatte’s amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been submitted to this Congress and cover a wide range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented to both Congress and the Senate - others are only slightly softened from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance sheet amendment in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients – especially beginners among Republicans who want to polish their CV – the opportunity to boast that they have “written” such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, which was passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can make, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the restriction to two terms of office of the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
An amendment that prohibits marriage among same-sex persons is, as does an amendment that prohibits burning flags, a recurring pattern.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states reject them.
As eager as the Members propose amendments, they move as quickly as they have been in recent years.
In the 111st Congress, legislators proposed 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, so the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Affected but not defeated", said Giffords in first TV interview after the assassination
Ten months after an armed man from the next distance shot at her during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, singing alone to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow, he returns to the wuhoer" and says, "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow."
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she ranks by words and needed help walking.
The broadcast showed the severe slow recovery from the damage that the bullet, which divided her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she unexpectedly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January assassination, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang — and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford, 41, replied, "It's pretty good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special recorded shortly before the couple's new book was released: "Gabby: A Story about Courage and Hope."
The special is tracking Gifford's recovery since the January 8 assassination.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, she is seen in a hospital bed, with a razor-shaped head and a long shell above her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nick with the head.
A pussy with the lips.
And then, her first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "toast". She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: You can see the congresswoman singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers' "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day with therapy, said she can’t remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he read a daily article on the assassination of Giffords on March 12 when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
Suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner is in a Missouri prison and is forced to receive medical treatment while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, heart, heart."
During his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer told her, "I was hit."
“So, I would say, ‘Gabby, you weren’t defeated,’” Kelly said.
You've just been hit.
And you'll get through it, and you'll recover, and you'll come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black smokers stood up and applauded.
"Soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation campaign in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer at the Gala, who was observed, among other things, by Chief of Staff and then-President Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, it really wasn't. It was compassion.
The sharply contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring, American public.
The troops are crowded with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, officials say.
The public is increasingly behaving like they are suffering people in uniform.
"We were not victims at all," Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
“But apparently the only way to support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls.”
The topic is extremely sensitive for military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in a dispute with the public they serve.
They have also recognized that the anger that the returning troops struck against in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations about compassion take place in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Canciano warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of reverence as they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "strengthening, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Canciano, who had fought in Iraq and has taken up a senior state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtly asked whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
“When you talk about your service, you have to keep the negative impressions against it,” Cancian told his sons.
The lack of militancy of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Performances on the battlefield are taken out by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, only rarely as praise.
“As a nation, we no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely common in World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a servant.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
The military is faced with increasing pressure to penetrate into rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in a rape before a military court.
If this is not the case, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and was 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a soldier colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her casserole in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who was carrying a pack of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could have a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the texaner wiped away her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
“I wish I had listened to my abdominal feeling.”
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man walked behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are anxiously awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it will be decided whether a lawsuit that they will have against former defense minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumslafeld, will be filed in court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld were not against the widespread rape within the military and violating the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, the lawsuit was filed by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but in the following months it increased to 28: 25 women and three men, all claiming that they were raped or sexually abused by military colleagues after being raped, abused, abused, or abused.
Burke says she is pursuing the top military leadership as the problem begins there.
“The military is hierarchical,” she says.
"Who are the individual persons who are in a position to eradicate the culture of revenge of the leadership?"
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of whom may be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of putting all the plaintiffs, so to speak, their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many more complaints to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed an application to dismiss the lawsuit.
The court’s records, which Newsweek presents, detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries to which it has come in the armed forces.
Due to a Supreme Court Act of 1950, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damages occurred during the military service of the plaintiffs," the document states.
The Ministry of Defence refuses any comments on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, then the distinction is only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contact with indigenous women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It is time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more complaints are pending except for her.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a women's hostile atmosphere.
Independently of this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is collecting a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that victims of rape received in order to release them from service - a common human right according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati's network service.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration (i.e., the Administration of War Veterans) in which she accused her of discriminatory practices in dealing with performance claims for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented independently by a mix of senators and representatives of both parties to Congress, offering a number of points of reference.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (i.e. the Office for Prevention and Reporting Sexual Abuse), 3,158 sexual abuses were reported by the Ministry of Defense.
However, most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure accounts for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report, published in March, also investigated the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases recorded in the military came before court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman’s case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the assault.
That night, she said, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a number of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was questioned by a judge during this hearing about the sex she had with her boyfriend before the assault.
Six people spoke out as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually released.
"I still remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought the beggars would use it. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember when I came out again, saying to my commander, 'That wasn't his procedure, that was my procedure.'
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it inoperable.
In January 2010, she was dishonestly fired, so she did not receive any support.
Whether the lawsuit filed by Lyman and the other plaintiffs is progressing is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I am a critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military goes back a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence that a liability brings with them.
He adds, "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try it."
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow her path, Burke, the plaintiff’s lawyer, will start with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms come,” she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who posted their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who claimed to have committed an amok robbery in Norway in July, killing 77 people, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by far not alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time before his attack on his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
That's easy - you just need to log in to Facebook.
“We have found it not difficult to come to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British Ideas Factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says that researchers simply need to use the page’s advertising tool to accurately determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy – as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans from far-right groups across Europe and then visualized them with Adds, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the Adds users were invited to a survey in which they were questioned about their status of education, their attitude towards violence and their opinion.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without even having to leave their office once.
"It's a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.
Online supporters of right-wing extremist groups are mostly young, male, and are concerned about immigration.
But in a kind of surprise twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens."
DEMO’s work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to societal trends such as "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, Facebook’s “Daten Supernova” generates a research boom that increased the number of scientific work titled this page in the title by almost 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people that you don’t normally reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to interview people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to first inform the party and it would never have given them access," Bartlett said.
“With Facebook, it all goes away – you go straight to them.”
Others say that the site provides an opportunity to recognize and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found that students who discussed their full-spirit on Facebook are significantly more likely to have trouble drinking than students who are silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal-level students, such as residential advisors, monitor the page and help a student if it posts too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't noticed it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and head of the Children's Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children who otherwise would not have been found."
Facebook also constantly retrieves the data of its own people.
The page’s data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, election participation in the 2010 midterm elections, and a national luck index (which primarily used data to which only Facebook has access – Master of Digital Freedom should have known for a long time that the page should know about its big data mining for others.
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they want it or not. In order to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to display its own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey that they don’t even know?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
“I don’t think many users have thought at all about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles,” said Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, in a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was all about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile and in posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research needs to take care of social – and a lot of social life still takes place offline.”
'Cold and Inhuman': Anders Behring Breivik appears in public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who suffered two amok races that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway," he said in a courtroom with more than 500 people.
“I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I acknowledge the laws, but I do not confess my guilt."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he "did not give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who delivered a pre-written speech, permission to contact the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, he did not have access to the media for four weeks, and said the authorities would closely monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
Approximately 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of being able to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted the confirmation that he stayed behind the castle and bars.
Everyone participated with the aim of making it all one way out.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
“It was unpleasant, but for me, it goes a little further after seeing and hearing the suspect.”
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked quietly and professionally throughout the whole hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered and left the building again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre hint that he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had complicities.
Some may have liked that the July 22 attacks were apparently the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the sadness and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
“I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn’t,” said a victim’s relative.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 lessons from the interview with deceased Steve Jobs, who was shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting engineering as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was created this week before special film screenings in the major markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed hippie, but he was also an acrylic organizer who was eager to draw diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffer from "a terrible disease of thought," "that there is a really great idea of a great handiwork between a great 90 percent of the work done...
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Facilitators" about the breakup of the personal computer, and he sat with jobs for more than an hour in which they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, 10 years had passed since jobs were pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, looking forward to the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley’s interview was used in professional journals, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing at the time of delivery.
It was only after Jobs’ death that a full copy of the VHS was discovered in the director’s garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to hate detailed interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
During the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds afterthoughts, in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to mind when he seems impatiently responds to Cringely's questions and encourages him to take action more quickly on topics or side actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, the lost interview seems somewhat incredibly meaningful when Jobs assesses what other companies think they are doing right or wrong and represents their own vision for the future of the computer.
It’s one thing to read posthumous credits of career jobs, but seeing jobs here as the craving dreamer who is on the leap to generosity is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of what things might and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he pulled out and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"Throughout the years in business, I always ask, 'Why are you doing things?' And the answer you always get is, 'Oh, that's how it's easy to do.'
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing, no one in the business really thinks about things.
That's what I've noticed.
Jobs continues its efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Amazed at how costs were recorded – most of the time you started with “standard costs” that were digitized to the simple assumption and then adjusted with “difference” – he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest extent.
As the Pope was commended:
Jobs talks about the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that allows you to get into the phone company and have free telephony conversations.
Much has been written about the device, but Jobs’ enthusiasm when describing the Blue Box as an act of self-authorization is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a chargeable phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while swiping through as many satellites as possible.
“We sent things half a dozen times around the globe and when we ran into the phone, a minute later it came out on the phone next door,” Jobs said.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something that can control trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn’t know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don’t think there would be Apple without them.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious stitch that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope while they could imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope himself called.
How he fell in love with the technique (and called unprepared Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"That had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at the age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company’s research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown tubes and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to Improve Innovations:
Jobs talks several times in the interview about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Already early in his career, when he built some boards, he was asked by a customer to build the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to consider both the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had with developing a computer mouse:
“I remember pervasive arguments... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost <0x24>300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer.”
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for <0x24>15. That was incredibly credible.
About large companies that leave behind:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants with their visions fell into disrepair and lost control of their stocks.
“Let’s say you’re working at IBM or Xerox, so you’re making a better copy or printer, right?”
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [are these people] ultimately leading the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is eradicated by people who have no concept of good vs. bad products - craftsmanship.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
One could have been ten times bigger, the Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
You have captured the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
“There’s a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about your subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You need to know 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it goes beyond the taste, it goes beyond trying to separate with the best thing that humans have created, and then trying to bring these things together into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shy in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people working there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who are by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren’t for the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws, as court decides case
On the day when the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to hear an indictment of President Obama’s health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner that was held in front of the court, which was held by the Kansons.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met at a meeting to discuss the petitions for verification.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the far-reaching health reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has become a hit among conservative activists across the United States.
In fact, a five-and-a-half-hour basic discussion is expected in March, the result of which is likely to spur the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time the court ruling is announced.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the law is to be dropped will probably be Paul Clement, a former Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clement’s office, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which opposed the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is financially heavily involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had deliberated on the case in a Washington hotel.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republican party in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health reform.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
This does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they did, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the code, which states: "A judge may attend charitable events of law and other organizations close by, with the judge not being a speaker, guest of honor or a guest according to the program."
Nonetheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the case-related firms and to a company with a massive financial interest in the case were enough to alarm moral and government activists.
“This astonishing breach of morality and contrary to the code punishes the claims of some judges for lying, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined during a beneficiary event with lawyers with floating proceedings in court."
Your performance and your support of a donation campaign for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little respect for critics who say they would confuse court affairs too easily with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a prosecutor-general under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits came to court in first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case for bias because she was too involved in defending the law to be biased.
Kagan does not make any agencies to do this.
Boeing pulls <0x24>18 trillion record on land
Emirate is ordering 50 two-way Boeing 777 aircraft with an option for 20 more aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than <0x24>1 billion.
It’s really rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big deal when the airline’s company is Boeing Co., and the list price for these 50 aircraft totals a record <0x24>18 trillion.
Equally unusual is Boeing’s client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth <0x24>450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest order of commercial aircraft of all time, measured by the order’s value: 50 two-seat Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the Emirates airline from Dubai.
The airline also announced in 2011 at the Dubai Aviation Show an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which will raise the total list price to <0x24>26 trillion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than <0x24>1 billion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, a stock exchange expert at Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are in the possession of oil-producing countries.
So they don't just have the money to pay for the planes, rather, an increase in oil prices, which usually hurts airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important as they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone airline orders as oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural security," he said.
The order from Emirates confirms Boeing’s leadership position in the large-space aircraft market and helps keep Airbus competitor SAS in check, which is attacking the pre-potential position with the A350.
Boeing’s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more confidence after customers demanded a higher payload and reach.
Boeing’s shares rose 1.5% to <0x24>67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Apparently Loses Election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealer Fausto Vallejo supported the PRI in the race for the governorship.
President Felipe Calderon's sister apparently lost her application for governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race for the governorship in the western state from the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The involvement of organized crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls... they occupied polling stations, built street blockades... and commissioned people to vote for [the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have barely defeated Claderon, who had led the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother’s Conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor, came in third place, a heavy defeat for the split and unlucky left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital city of Morelia, denies connections to drug dealers and urges other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels that specialize in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence still persists.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have stepped out of the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how opposing the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the race for the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo of Washington and said, "I think this victory will give us a bold look at next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, ADB’s Managing Director based in Manila, said the two fastest-growing economic nations in the world must “do everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) looking "unwillingly" at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources by Asia will help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So everyone is helpful who can help Europe out of this crisis," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the outskirts of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune.”
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
In recent months, the European Monetary Union has entered a major debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy’s interest rates have increased dangerously and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe raises fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls for the leading emerging countries to come together to support the eurozone.
Mr. Nag predicted that any support to Asia would be channeled by the IMF, but said mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU bailout bonds, the European Financial Stabilization Facility (EFSF) - provided greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its economy is now suffering from declining exports and dehydration of foreign capital flows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an assignment, because somewhere else we can find work for our millions of young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no reason to help the wealthy Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at the U.S. Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to the 1.2 billion people in India for Europe, of which more than 800 million of <0x24>2 million or even less live on a daily basis.
"Sometimes they will find out that the Greeks are going to retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid public service employees in Greece, with jobs misdirected, causing losses to institutions such as the railway.
Mr Nag said the crises in the eurozone will have "significant domino effects" on the whole of Asia.
ADB’s forecast of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia for 2011 now threatens “the risk of degradation” due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable threshold markets would have to create “crisis plans” to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital shift in their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible defensive cuts
Defence Minister Leon Panetta called on Congress on Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts would unduly weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon’s halls to the warheads in Afghanistan and civilian flows.
The Pentagon is already contemplating cuts of <0x24>450 trillion over the next decade, but is now afraid that further cuts of <0x24>600 trillion or more will be needed if Congress can’t get a clue in spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which would lead to a so-called seizure, would lead to 23% overall cuts as well as a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a high cut, carried out in such a thoughtless way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impracticable - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously damage," Panetta wrote to the Senate.
“We would also be forced to involuntaryly separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian personnel, and since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would certainly have to allow civilians with limited probability to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness,” he said.
The cuts eventually hit the combat troops,” Panetta said.
"While the wartime contingents in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious interference in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Personal appointments have been shortened, which would lead to delays in settings and oversight of appointments that support the war."
"The salaries of staff would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime traders and legal as well as political support would be disrupted."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential impact of automatic cuts on the defense ministry.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would initiate a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently against this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when they published Panetta's letter.
“This is a result that we cannot live with, and it’s certainly nothing that you should push us.”
“The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its entry should not be allowed.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and the new warnings from Senators will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or increase demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts remains to be expected.
Panetta has increasingly consistently pronounced the possible cuts, although he was able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister painted a dark picture of what could be coming – a military with shell, but without core.
"It's a ship without marines."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It's a paper bag, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech in the Pentagon.
“It’s a force that lacks morality and alertness and is not able to take it up with potential opponents.”
"She makes one really angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details on how reductions create “significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious constraints on our global deployment and intervention capacity, which leads to a risk-taking operation.
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects of the strike could be the victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new Littoral Combat Ship, and the new ground combat vehicle, the Army and Navy needed to replace the Humvee.
If we stop the further development and testing of the F35, it would save up to <0x24>80 trillion over the next 10 years, but supporters say it is an important next step to rearmament so that potential threats can be banned by China and other opponents.
How to Uncover a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how thoughtful and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy making the accusations of sexual harassment on the part of several women Lord. Both sides face each other the lie.
Penn State’s management is accused of being detained for allegedly holding reports of a retired football coach sexually abusing boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nicolas Sarkozy told U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he put into circulation denials that were very quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations in campaign funding related to the concealment of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it will forget the media circus triggered by President Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about bullying in school and college exams are widespread.
There were instances where teachers gave their students the exam answers so that they could be well-equipped even in their performance tests.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and gossip are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
However, many of these lies are considered to be necessary.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing or "discovering lies" is one that is important to learn for every person, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a societal game such as shards, in which the goal is to call out "Have You!", the clearing of a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data that has been collected in the last six decades at prestigious universities, in the fields of physics, physics, and science.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been uncovered.
Lies look one in the eye.
They do not always stomp, stalk, roar, and slap.
However, we cannot conclude from this that these liars are difficult to uncover and uncover.
A trained liar can penetrate the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years investigating the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing field of deception. And it is clear that deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us to find justice in our complex world, especially in listening to the individual or questioning when setting or answering the question.
Good liars are very good at evaluating other people, arousing their interest and mastering their own emotions, and they intuitively feel how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people are more likely to lie than introverted people, that men are more likely to "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - they usually want to protect me from being married to people (they are married to their spouses)
We also know that when a person has been detected as a criminal, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called Baseling, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for assessing changes at a later date.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of their subject.
You should know better when someone usually trips with the foot all the time so they don’t blame him wrong when he trips with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of striking verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that shriek, not as evidence of detachment.
People who are deceiving may stare when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the job interview" if all are in front of this deep, hard-hearted, relaxing question.
Questioners often falsely signal that a setup call is over, only to keep an eye out after this relaxation after the setup call.
Also, pay attention to the language of your test person.
Scott Peterson’s slider is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceiving people can also use a distancing language: "I didn't have a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a cluttering question as a whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well...to tell you the truth...as far as I know...to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
As a result, the answer becomes more perceptive than factual, which is why the alarm bells often ring.
There is no magical way to clear lies, but you can learn abilities that make it possible to clear.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can rarely become the victim of fraudsters, both in private and professional life.
The controversial plan of an oil pipeline will be revised after danger due to delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada into the Gulf of Mexico, annoying the trade unions and at the same time calming environmentalists, the pipeline-building companies can try to re-plan the project again.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be rerouted from the environmentally sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was reviewed, which included the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may postpone a decision until 2013, after the next year’s elections, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was a task of the foreign ministry and said he supported the decision.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to the Gulf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but they love job markets because they estimate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But the Nebraska legislators, who are against the plan, weighed the laws to force a departure from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ impact on the environment has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the principal auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s advisor in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of allegedly forcing a child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have had a tobacco attack that would have scared her little daughter so much that she gave up on fear.
The tyranny of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family told the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was November 10 of last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergartener, and Genevieve wanted to start a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard with her luggage and Genevieve on her arm.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and stopped her daughter for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?' I said, 'Yes,' and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angry.
“She said in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t put your daughter down near the door,’ said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'
She got angry and started to sneeze - she used the F word and the A word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to pour water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’ said the child’s mother.
LaBelle crashed onto the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be restrained from her escort and pulled into a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family wrote an apology, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for an opinion.
The lawsuit is about a no-determined damages compensation, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he would not charge a fee and the family plans to donate the money they get to the child’s cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
"This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is put on the back of a babysitter carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climate resilience slows the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and black work increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and sparked great hopes for economic growth, is in the government. However, the most important part of the economy, as a result of climate adversity, can not be the most important part of the adversity.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in the amount of millions in agriculture, but also placed tight limits on the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6 per cent in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the decline in the economy, mainly due to the economic growth of the country16.
According to a report issued by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustainable (i.e. Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of frost, 582 000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 per cent were fully harvested, and the remaining 21.07 per cent were harvested.
The decline in economic activity until November19 led to a steady increase in unemployment in the Mexican state.In the first quarter, the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment, since from January to March 18,000 people were unemployed, from 55,053 people in Sinaloas were unemployed, and from September 5, there was no employment.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa this year goes back to several factors. Economics scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónomo (UAS), comments, the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growth of work.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including liquidity losses in the market as a result of the mid-term cuts by legislation, which has not been passed in order to combat money laundering, because it is too laute to work for those who are forbidden to do so.
The migration stopped.
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined. This is due on the one hand to the problems of entry and on the other, because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here and look for work here.
Black Labour
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more difficult, given the high proportion of black labour, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38% of the workers in the country who work without having to pay in the social insurance boxes.
Unemployment and black work are the lowest wages in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Agency) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Governmental Agency for Labour and Social Care in Mexi).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos as of September; that is much less than the national average of 7375 pesos.
Decreased ADI
In addition to declining economic activity and increasing unemployment, the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (DDI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to the Secretariat of Economics (State Economic Authority), the DDI was <0x24>3 in January to June, at a rate of <0x24>3 per year, which was <0x24>5,87 per year, at a rate of <0x24>3,630,597 per year.
The Secretaria de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Governmental Agency for Economic Development) for its part recorded a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debts
In the face of the economic crisis, the national government applied to the National Congress in July for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos, which should be invested to reactivate the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities. The national congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but it was not possible for us to provide a positive loan to the outs of November.
Reactions
For the representatives of the Entrepreneurship, the first year of government made Mario López Valdés’s inability to govern clearly.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Processing Industry in Mexico), said that in 2011 no effort was made to harmonize the views of the various sectors, including the government of the country.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very strong this year. It has to be worked hard to regain the land lost this year and in 2012 we have to double efforts. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already well-established government team have not been sufficient," he explained.
Slow economic developments
Loredo López stated that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country’s economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important impacts is a slowing economy, which is not moving enough to bring about an economic dynamic, which could lead to an acceptable flow of our processes, products and services," he said.
Redefine call
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana in Sinaloa, said that the state should be encouraged to do more productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There's a lot to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that guides the government’s efforts in better tracks.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress with the government.
"There are areas where one can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that the government has been working and is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was convicted of a crime against public health – here the marijuana property intended for trade.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I Act, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican soldiers in the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez Street in front of the 80th Guard Post in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and a small backpack on the passenger seat, in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the punishment is still in the enforcement agency.
Debt for construction works
The social structures provided for in the programmes Habitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda said.
The head of the Urban Authority for Social Development said that, although the construction programs have already advanced, they are now at risk, as the state government has not paid the funds available to it, which exceeds 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state. So far only the Federation and the municipality had contributed to the construction funds, which is why a delay in construction completion is expected.
"They have to support 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, and that, even though they should have paid us a part in July," he said. "To be clear, we have already started the construction work, but they have already gone far."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state failed to meet its obligations, which is why the municipality had to take up a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its term of government, which corresponds to the amount that the central government should have spent.
"We had already done this in the last legislature, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes went on and this year we had to get the funds that the state had not put in to participate in these programmes," he said.
Even though the state authorities are obliged to pay off these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance was asked to accelerate administrative work and pay off the remaining share as soon as possible.
"Almost 12 million have to help, and although the year is coming to an end, they haven't given us a penny."
Court approves transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The transformation of analogues to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) pointed out the constitutional claims filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential leave, and by virtue of which the switching from analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be postponed, due to the lack of eight votes, which are required to be repealed to the bill.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, were of the opinion that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the Decree with details on switching to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute brought into existence by the Senate, as it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide whether constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
The draft lawsuit, which was drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, was proposed to declare the law decree unconstitutional, as for the regulations relating to radio and television the Commission Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications is responsible for the Pre-Telecommunications and the Prinzi-Set).
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed complaints against the Decree-Law. After accepting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree-Law and set up all activities to establish digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project, for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Government of the country is not allowed to regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by general regulations.
"I also do not believe that if we do this, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also recalled that for strategic policy planning, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible for the planning of strategic policy areas.
Replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it results in better use of the radio spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, is a postponement of the use of digitalization, which is a decision in the public interest, which has not only technical aspects, "because it encompasses economic, social, political and security aspects."
These issues, she stressed, "required the action of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic leadership by the state, they included a group of characteristics that lay the Constitution in the hands of the central state government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital transformation, namely through the government, although they had highly specialized institutions.
It cannot be concluded that with the issue of the contested decree, the government intervenes in the jurisdiction of Congress, because the laws passed by the legislature would be complied with,” she said.
The possibility of counting the ballot in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of counting the ballots alone is a reality in the Michoacán elections this year, because according to the data issued by the Programme de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second seats in the governor’s elections is 74 percent of the votes, with almost 60 percent of the votes in 879.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that just on November 9, the polling station had a series of rules to harmonise local regulations with the reforms of the federal elections in the state.
It should be remembered that neither his political constitution nor his electoral law nor his law on electoral justice had adapted to the reforms passed by the Congress, so that these did not come into force during this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel did not have any intention of publishing them with the consent of the Governor.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature and judged the Ombudsman's vote on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and unlawful" since he does not have the right to "decide or veto".
María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained in an interview about the possibility of counting the votes alone that thanks to the adoption of the directives by the General Council of the IEM there was now the possibility that the local electoral authority could partially or completely count the ballot.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted. The results in the minutes do not coincide; the minutes on the counting and calculation of the votes are not present at the moment or it is not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are amendments to the minutes.
In addition, the total number of full ballots can be counted if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the one who is in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the candidate of the party.
The vote counting may also be carried out in its entirety if, after the completion of the proper calculation, it was found that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in the second place was equal to or less than a percentage, provided that there is an express request from a representative of the party, the representative of the party, the judge, is out of this case.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will.
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés took place on Sunday night at Saltillo, his birthplace, and on Monday there was a death show and a funeral fair.
According to family members, the Lieutenant Colonel’s last will was to disperse his ashes across the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others killed in the accident in a Mexican air force plane, returned to the capital of Coahuila, where the nearest people to the colonel participated in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At twelve o’clock the ash of the Lieutenant Colonel landed on the mourning hall on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family and friends came.
At 5:30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, which was caused by the ex-students of his technical academy and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, during his preparations for the academy.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, which he had always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
In her view, the Lieutenant Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, and she believes that he stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and as a son, a loving brother, and he always stood for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to join the Zapopan Air Force School, Jalisco.
Some couldn’t understand it because they thought it would be awkward for him even on a truck, yet he always sought to realize his dream of being a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family already wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he took Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had been driving to Zapopan to graduate from his family, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked most: flying a plane.
A last goodbye
The lieutenant-colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was greeted with all honours under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres López. His honour was granted to him by the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Territory, the 19th Infantry Division of the Mexican Air Force, the 19th Infantry Division of the Mexican Air Force and the University of Sport.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew from, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority were also sitting down.
At 6:05 p.m., the enclosed remains of Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the premises of the casserole, where his relatives, his relatives, his relatives and his relatives, his relatives, his relatives, and his relatives were already waiting for him.

On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government, which is to put the head of the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government, which is to put the head of the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of talks with the political parties on government formation.
“I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country’s ability to cope with these difficult times,” the former EU Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “frame is now well-connected,” he added.
In less than three days, Monti has managed to form a government, which is much less time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of the debt to an intolerable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must pass a tough savings package called for by Europoliticians to regain confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti has been exacerbated by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which the Italian government bonds have been charged at 7% interest for 10 years, which is the same as the situation in which Greece and Ireland have been forced to apply for the European rescue shield.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industrial association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government as much as possible."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Montis’ chances of success were significantly increased by the support of the PDL party by Silvio Berlusconi, who had to step down on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are determined to deliver good results,” said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Mid-Right Party.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is essential, as so far many of its members have voted against a majority technocrat government that is currently forming Monti.
Parliament's support
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts or the delay in the reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks is exercising pressure to note that Montis’s failure is a disaster.
Monti began his debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations as well as youth and women’s organizations.
The session will be closed on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who launched an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a short breath at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, as a result of uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister, the cost of Italian bonds has again reached critical limits.
A rescue of Italy with a state debt of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 trillion would be too much for the current EU rescue shield.
Monti said his government would have to wait until the next election, which is expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms, rather than prefer the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a hint of their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
Spaniards have more gambling opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the buckle.
Costa Rica has only one of the 22 inviting 50 games behind it.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendly match, which will take place today at 3:05 p.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champion, the number one on FIFA’s monthly ranking, can look back on a significant number of Class A selection games, the three-coloured team only has defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential Premier League clubs of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (league and cup championships) as well as high-ranking European cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experiences with Spanish fury in complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the football world championships.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international matches within the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA rankings at the bottom.
We will see how the Spanish team draws their last record: Torwart Iker Casillas, who last Saturday scored against England (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 overseas matches against former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play against the three-colour team today and Spain will record a new record of 127 international games.
Xavi Hernández, player of Barcelona football club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the midfielder of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number one hundred is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso at 91, Fernando Torres at 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both at 81, Andrés Iniesta at 62, Cesc Fábregas at 61 and David Silva at 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side stormer Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the stormer Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five matches were played: Keilor Navas at 31, Randall Azofeifa at 32, Michael Barrantes at 31, Carlos Hernández at 36 and José Luis López at 35.
The ones with the fewest games.
There are less than 30 games in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
Roy Miller, 26, Winston Parks, 25, Gabriel Badilla, and Roy Myrie.
The rest is not even close to the 20s.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, Víctor Bolívar has only one record in Costa Rica and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored nine goals, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet refers to Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says the band is ready to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
For more than 20 years they were expected, but the band ensures that a dream comes true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the group’s bassist and co-founder, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva last week from Brazil an exclusive interview.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium from 7:30 p.m. along with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You are reading an excerpt from the interview, whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is the second time we have played in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica once for a holiday. It is such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely committed, they experience the days before the concert more intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for being on our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry to have taken so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will become the biggest show of the year.
Doesn’t that put a little pressure on your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve done in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on some giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and are passionate about the jungle, so Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always been to surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the excellent areas for surfing. In this way, about people who love surfing, we have learned about it.
With a look at the tour, you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there, we don’t set limits.
We will try to give the best show possible with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
- Why?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs, everyone likes a different song, so the decision we’re going to play isn’t easy.
If we put two or three songs that we no longer play in the repertoire, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked them, otherwise they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think that’s why it’s also for the audience.
With this tour, you will celebrate your twenty-year history.
If you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, total.
First of all, I think that none of us have ever imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years, which seems like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like it and are excited to bring out music.
We are fortunate to be able to drive to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have been actively involved in the birth of the Grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement comes out of a group of friends.
Occasionally, a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are still looking forward to being friends with them all and it is an honor to be part of this Seattle sound that came up.
It is also very unusual for a band like yours to have been together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which alone is much more time than many bands last.
First of all, I believe that we all value being happy, still alive, and we take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
We can't get any better with each other and their music.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy, but thanks to your success, you can always do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it’s too easy to drop this game with huge crowds of people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has brought to life without relying on being a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
We were disappointed to have taken such a long time. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I remember what an incredible man Andy was, and how he always brought me over to work and laughed and laughed. It was too much.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that’s why the band chose for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band the most, which is why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That will certainly be exciting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing that suits him.
Who was influenced by you as a bassist?
of so many<0x2B>
Among the first ones that come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk about the bassists I liked all afternoon.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fashion phenomenon?
I think we all don’t feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I like the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think it’s great because it’s worth listening to this music and making bands like Mudhoney better than ever.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
- Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a little light-hearted, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive about themselves.
The tears came to both of them when I heard Ed play them. They're very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life — for example, if you lose a family member or a friend — that affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embodies that for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori to return to hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was taken to a public hospital on Tuesday to examine the muscle loss of his legs, his doctor said.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who spent 25 years in prison for human rights violations during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is operated on and under control four times.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congressman and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined at the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas in Peru for three days to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, yet he did not wish for this because he considered him innocent.
He was operated on four times on lung cancer and lost 18 kilograms of weight, including other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems with bleeding in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the Police since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruvian army, which served secretly during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official roundup, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin their visit from Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday, which, according to the Uruguayan president, will be the culmination of his scheduled appointment with politicians, business people and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the country's presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón’s support for the incident with France when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Mr Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still act as tax havens from the international community, which Uruguay rejected and prompted a request from his ambassador in the European country.
Since November, Mexico has chaired the G20, a group of the world’s most powerful evolving and industrialized countries, and since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double timing with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to accelerate the implementation of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that do not have all international standards for tax cooperation.
At the commercial level, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The cordless installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but until now he has never been in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the girl's love of stereo technology.
The game, which comes to stores all over the world this month, has been tailored from the beginning to the features of the portable console Nintende 3DS, with which you can play without a special three-dimensional glasses.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the head of the specialised press in Spain at the video game show in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game developed by Nintendo from the beginning for this console" because so far success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of Time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman stressed that, although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows for a fast, smooth game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "light" to capture the less skilled users.
After that, the experts can turn a “second round” over the different levels of play, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without being victimized by the "optical effects", it is always necessary to play three-dimensionally.
This trip of Super Marios into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo is immersing fans of the saga and repeating the recipe for success of the latest editions: The ruthless installer must overcome endangered platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom is responsible for delivering Portillos to the United States
Guatemala’s President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he would hand over the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to hold him responsible for the <0x24>70 million money laundering conspiracy in the United States.
This is how the process of the U.S. request for Portillo’s extradition ends, so that Portillo can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colum confirmed his decision based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a ruling court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that during his government he had not interfered with court decisions and had taken all extradition requests that he had been notified of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is extradited for murder and serious injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The Coloms Procedure is an act of government that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former President (2000-2004).
According to the judgments of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited if his legal status in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was freed for the defeat of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his reign. This negotiation preceded the extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people threatened with social exclusion
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social assistance organization Trinijove have led to important results: 6,000 young people, threatened with social exclusion, have been supported in this quarter century to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs have been created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, which involved more than 300 people, was held yesterday.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with drug problems at risk of marginality.
The celebration took place yesterday in Sant Andreu, where a number of leaders from institutions and institutions who have worked with the association for the past 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions during the election campaign proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and former Mayor and currently left-green City Council Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the General Director of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was born in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated. But he added that the work done so far "is a good foundation".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that is white to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
“The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does,” he said.
Occupied house, where giant parties were held, was spawned
The owners of the house had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes street 51 (Barcelona).
The 12 housekeepers left the building yesterday afternoon without any resistance.
Everything points to the fact that the nightmares of the neighbors of house 51 on the street Balmes have ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building, which they had been illegally occupied, and in which they had organized huge festivities that had driven the neighbourhood to despair. The clearing took place on a court order without any police intervention.
After cleaning, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be checked," the house manager confirmed.
The housekeepers, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took with them all the electrical system and part of the water supply, painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially bottles of alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated that lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that its business had declined by 80% since the start of the house occupancy.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the homeowners made her an unpleasant competition because they sold the drinks for three euros, while the ones in the discotheque cost 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the recreational venue had been shown by the neighbours due to rest disturbance, while according to her, the noise was not caused by the visitors of the disco, but by the housekeepers and in particular by the guests of the parties, who were always organized there, and who, according to the reports of the campers, were more and more.
The director of the discotheque explained that the harassment had been so great that she agreed with the building’s owner not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that it has received more complaints from neighbours in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) at Barcelona's City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had last week called for the building to be cleaned immediately and to get the problems of bourgeois coexistence and the downfall of the district in the hands.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last few months the house occupants had been raiding all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some, it had even been theft.
In this sense, he added, "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to intervene against the social actions in the building."
Yesterday another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., police approached Montral street 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people invade the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects have agreed to the tender, in addition to the controversies over the fees.
The urban call for tenders for the 16 gates will re-open the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-disappearing Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its draft on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It was even compared in numbers to Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became the upper limit of Barcelona in the eyes of many, as the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not extend in the north-south direction, but upwards (mountain) and downwards (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park plays with this idea.
The Central Park no longer served as an example, but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of the Yogi Bear.
So far, when the city issued a huge tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola in September.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that’s the case, or someone is planning to put gates on the ground.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
Not only from an organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city, the topic of conversation in the mouth of all the architects from Barcelona.
It’s almost a recurring topic that two members of this old-fashioned caste, who meet in the elevator, can turn to.
And this is precisely the fact that provides the fabric for one of the rare agreements between what three architects from Barcelona think about it, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The call for tenders is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary to speak about the "front on the mountain" after the attack on the coast, insofar as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who over the green apples, has not been heard.
“It should be assumed that Barcelona’s largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is well-accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Port of Collserola" carries a "lexical trap": one must not imagine it "as access to a park, but as a confinement of areas in which to trade."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, sees the proposal as a "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers".
Dangers as a result of the "uncertainty that brings about the design of a public space today" according to the experiences of the 1980s that had their "swinging singing" in the area of the forum.
The first concern is to limit oneself to what can be built.
“To limit something is always to set the next step,” that is, to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who sticks closer to the question, believes that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by Patronat de Collserola that should not "shut on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his board the opportunity to participate in this project "from the very first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city of the letter of direction allows architects to take part in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" about whether this technical profile should only be the multidisciplinary teams that were put in place ("the right ones," he says.
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, since in the tendering conditions a global view of Collserola is missing: "There have been written 16 competitions in the cross section," he says, "on the axis of mountain-sea." But there is no intersection in his geography.
At least in his case, this has led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next door.
In his opinion, the city should definitely guarantee that the strip is equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, creating a smooth transition between the city and green areas.
Casino taxed by Jonas Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the representatives of Casino Red free the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial that is being conducted against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of detention, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal is released after he was pardoned by the Casino Red's representative before the District's Second Criminal Court, which is leading the trial against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the assassination of the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, released a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonas allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the gambling house.
After the prosecution, the prosecutor opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the panistian mayor, who was arrested on September 2, for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the capital’s Antiguo District.
He remained at this place 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio Público had dismissed the offences for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta's detention facility for allegedly suing the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos, but remained in the middle-security treaty for only a few hours as murder threats posed against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as a prisoner of the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison.
On 25 October, he was given a detention order by the Secretary of the District’s Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who found that after nearly two months of investigations, sufficient evidence could be provided to plead Jonas guilty to the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representative of the district.
On Monday, Casino Red’s attorney, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor’s brother, to pass the sentence, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs assigned to the court, García Gómez, asked whether he had corrected the damage and which of the owners of the courthouse had given his pardon, but the lawyer retained the name.
According to the legal case 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is free to speak, and no objections against the trial can be made in the following, and no damages are required.
After hearing the House of Representatives at about 3:50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yánez, went to the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison to inform Jonas that he had been released and that his case would be filed.
He also informed him about the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announced details of the plane crash, which killed government secretary Francisco Blake and seven other people.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation into the accident, which killed the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people, could directly indicate that Nopratla is a victim of the helicopters, which is an accident with all of its uninjured studs.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, with the helicopter losing its hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why he met all the conditions for the transport of the personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine had landed.
"The search did not find any aircraft parts elsewhere, the landing affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it satisfies all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently, it is preferable to get the results of the study as soon as possible, but these may take several months, maybe even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter flew from the State Mayor Presidential during the landing at a speed of travel and that the plane was suspended on a soft crash.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visible flight:
In accordance with flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of sight flight, which means that the crew should have had sufficient sight during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions: <0xE2><0x80><0xA2>
The AICM recorded the appropriate weather conditions at the start, and during the further flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the state of Mexico, some deep-hanging clouds pulled up.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley due to the clouds.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter are consistent, and there may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or deviation from the flight route prior to the impact.
Dispersion of the aircraft’s remains in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was hit from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered airplanes suggests that the helicopter was blown up on the ground with its unscathed structure.
No signs of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft do not allow fire or explosion at the site of the accident.
The latest research results suggest that there are several ground contacts.
In the field investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level. The site is depleted and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to have broken.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a thorough search into an area that went beyond the blocked area at the crash site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforced the assumption that the intact aircraft structure was hit against the ground.
MSS Announces Research Protocol to Find the Obesity Gene
The Social Security Institute of Mexico is conducting a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico Social Insurance Institute) has announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth", with which the genetic markers are associated with overweights.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that an interdisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, nurses, nurses and nurses became
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested persons can come to the sports venues of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are conducted every Saturday from 8.00 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation began at the Cuauhtémoc sports ground (Western Mexico) and has been continuing since October 8 at the Nezahualcóyolt sports ground (East Mexico).
When the target of 500 to 600 subjects is reached, the study will be continued on the sports ground of Independencia (south of the capital district) and completed on the one of Morelos (north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to know the factors and the role of genetics associated with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors in Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of World Diabetes Day, he stated that it will be sought that three thousand children and young people aged six to 14 years should complete nutrition-related questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of illness to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He further stated that on the mentioned Saturdays the subjects would be measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure controlled, and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (trying to identify fatty tissue in the co-binding gene).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out on the occasion of the health care staff’s concern about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"Health surveys from 1999 and 2006 found that in nearly six years, the proportion of obese boys and girls with obesity increased by 77 percent, and overweight increased dramatically," the IMSS specialist said.
He claimed that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the Mexican population differed from the other peoples.
He stated that one (e) Mexican (in) is on average 65 percent of Native American, 30 percent of European and 5 percent of African ancestry, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
Generally, he explained, the genetics of obesity express itself in the inability to burn out the excess of energy (calories) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the study participants was a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and inner arm (acanthosis), indicating the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the measurements and suggest them changes in lifestyle that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors responsible for obesity, obesity, and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV, and using means of transportation instead of short-circuiting.
The high calorie intake, that is, increased consumption of sugary beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) along with a high fat and protein intake, as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents stroke holes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM, Mexico, developed polymer-modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If we were to pay attention to the signs that come from the street cover, it would not be necessary to fully repair almost 200,000 holes when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the Valley of Mexico) is interrupted, as told by the University of Mexico, Rafael Herrera Nájera, the University of Applied Sciences, and the University of Applied Sciences.
In his lecture "Technical Holes", which he held on the occasion of the International Year for Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible developed asphalt modified with polymers to produce an asphalt-like mixture, but which also has a greater resistance to temperament than ever.
Herrera Nájera believed that this type of modified asphalt in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behavior of the road surface and thus avoid the appearance of impact holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, one of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthen.
The asphalt's density behavior means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180<0xC2><0xB0> C., at 120<0xC2><0xB0> C. it is very density-liquid and almost fixed at 50<0xC2><0xB0> C., while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer said.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had mostly a flexible street cover, consisting of six layers of material, of which the last three contained asphalt.
Between the upper layers lies an abrasive layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then fortified.
Every single stone of this layer of wear has been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles continue to move on, and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
“If there were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed,” said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he said, "a last layer, the so-called bearing layer, which consists of small stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt, will be designed.
Since these layers are in contact with the vehicle tyres, they require greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they must produce friction.
As this road coating receives and distributes most forces, the bearing layer also needs a suitable thickness and the material from which it consists must be maintained.
Weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially water, he said, "because it significantly affects the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes wet, water enters the layer and only difficult to come out again, causing all the layers of the road covering to soften and, as a result, the appearance of impact holes.
When a punch hole is created, he said, "the cover layer is first removed while the wear layer is only damaged afterwards. But the damage does not arise immediately, but it is a process that is maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road covering must always be proportional to the load of the vehicle, and this must be ensured to the load of the vehicle.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research work was still pending, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, and with which the impact holes could be repaired easily and without application of high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets its 14th title.
Once again Valle del Cauca went out empty at the awarding of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to stand on the winning podium, showcasing a silver crown and the band, which she designates as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, Garzala (88), Olphaela (88), Romera (88), where Miss Atlántico took over the crown and the cedar, the department is already joining the Legion of women from Valle del Cauca (19, 19), Aljute (19, 19), Conjunto (19, 19), Conjunto (19, 19), Conjunto (19, 19), Conjunto (19, 19), Conjunto (19), Conjunto (19), Conjunto (19), Conjunto), Conjunto (19), Conjunto (19), Conjunto), Conjunto (19), Conjunto), Conjunto (19), Conjunto), Conjunto (19), Conjunto), Conjunto), Conjunto (19, Conjunto), Conjunto), Conjunto), Conjunto (19, Conjunto), Conjunto, Conjunto), Conjunto, Conjunto, Conjunto), Conjunto, Conjunto, Conjunto, Conjunto, Conjunto, Conjunto, Conjunto, Conjunto, Conjunto, Conjunto, Conjunto, Conjunto, Conjunto, Conjunto, Conjunto, Conjunto, Con.
The big question that many people ask themselves today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite who had shown at each show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she had been chosen as the queen of the police and the best Rostro Jolie by Vogue, titles that are close to the house of Navarro, the Navarros and the beauty of the Tavalini.
The first factor that is considered decisive for the jury’s decision to nominate her as First Miss is that she did not give the answer to the question “Which book influenced you the most and why?” that was given to her by Martín Murillo Gómez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questionnaire:
“I read a lot, I believe pretty much in literature, I believe it is a way of civilizing myself, in the end I believe that the book that best marked my childhood, ‘The Little Prince’, is a rather deep-seated book.
At the moment, I am reading 'Cult and Sin'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Passionen'.
A response that came to little love, first because of the concept of "civilization," and secondly because it had not specifically explained how each of her books had influenced her.
But at the end of the ceremony, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: “The universe is wise, what has to happen is happening.
And for all people: Please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the favorite who hosted all the incidents and had received all the awards in advance (the Easter Gastronomy Competition, the audience's vote on the best uncut costume and Reina Madre stressed), "was the one who was the one who made the other candidates' chicks-in-law.
And this was noted when she first performed in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and at her two lifts at the coronation ceremony.
Although she was safe with both of them, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins most prizes during the competition will eventually not become queen".
Also, Valle went out of the way to the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have his reason that two days before the international jury’s compilation Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman engaged in the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. One has to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, that she had already participated in the project before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects in derriere and fibrosis, which were observed in her stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good nutritional responsibility and nutrition.
Queens coach Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina didn’t have the best body, that there was better, “but her problem with abdominal fibrosis, which to be honest, was barely noticeable for me, pushed her score on the last day.”
In the meantime, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos is of the view that the mistakes of the woman from Valle del Cauca were the surgical procedures she had undergone.
“The operations are ok, but Valle didn’t know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay her."
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, after the appearance in the bathing suit, a cruel prediction arose, which should be realized at night. It was obscured that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize so that she did not get into the enjoyment of the crown.
Whether this is true or not, the fact is that Melina will be present from now on, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that will give her the opportunity to represent on the designation of the National Beauty Competition of Colombia in one of the international competitions.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had lost the crown.
This was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A lophoscopist from Cali entered history when the man who identified "Alfonso Cano" entered history.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4, a lophoscopist of the Prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali went as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), aborted by "Alfonso Cano".
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliasar González, a Puerto Tejada man who has been working on criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to travel to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, that is, the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the hands and feet.
In the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliasar was instructed to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big awaited him.
On Friday night, he flew a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was suspicion that one of the man who had led the world's oldest guerrilla could be one, so he should take the ten-finger print of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was, he was unable to identify it because of its physical appearance, because it was not in the slightest resemblance to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, did not wear glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a lupe, ink, plant shell and a flashlight, Eliasar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the printed sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was actually the head of the FARC.
In search of traces
For a Sijín dactyloscopy in Cali, the appreciation given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in solving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the detainees.
When they are arrested, many criminals present false identification papers or they do not have them.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that in the case of a thief, he had to tear a piece of a wall out of a house, because the thief had just stood up with his hand at this point when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Wings are difficult because their surfaces are inadequate for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to take the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the perpetrator who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
The fingerprints can also be used to relieve or burden murder suspects.
Recently, a dead body was found surrounded by snap bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be a suspect, and in fact a fingerprint matched on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the killer, it is connected to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that "fingerprints would be taken with chemical or physical reagents from the object."
When they appear, a plant cell or a tape is used for inclusion.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, the criminal database, or to the staff.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification papers,” the CTI expert said.
He said that not everything was as it would be portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
However, it can still be used if you make a comparison.
The “Imports” Calls New York Authorities Out
Hundreds of protesters gathered in tents at Zuccotti Square.
Much of it came after the cleaning order and changed its location into a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement on Tuesday called on the New York authorities to try to re-enter the Manhattan Square with a court order after they were cleared from the square in the morning and tried to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters clashed in front of the Zuccotti square, on which they wanted to give access to the new tent, with a court order allowing the "emportors" to enter the place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement remained at the evacuation site.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray argued that the response of the "emprisoners" to the clearing of her tent camp, ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came before the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent clearing of the square and giving the protesters the genocide.
In addition, the "Empörten" occupied a new park, located at the intersection of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey and is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the site for at least an hour. But after that, the police raided and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray could not give exact numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he had seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization said hundreds of people had arrived at this spot, where a gathering of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a private property) remains closed in anticipation of a court hearing, which is still scheduled for this Tuesday, and in which the legality of the clearing taking place in the morning is to be analyzed.
Some of the protesters driven by the square carried photocopies of this judicial order and distributed them to some police officers who were guarding the square, which resulted in "small clashes," as Bray reported, who had reported that some policemen had beaten the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from clearing members of Occupy Wall Street from the square as well as the application of "laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that due to this court order, the reopening of the square for public transport and the demonstrators had been suspended, and the protesters pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to enter this court again with tents and sleeping bags.
The mayor personally defended the early morning cleaning of Zuccotti Square, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and it was decided because the protesters "disappeared against the law."
Bloomberg said he would have given the order to clear the square because it had "transformed into a place where people did not come to protest, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people," because "some businesses" would have "feared the threats" of their homes.
“The morning clearing was ugly and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not the interests of North American workers,” the spokesman added, accusing the mayor of not respecting “freedom of the press.”
The officials of Occupy Wall Street informed that they were contemplating organizing “great actions” for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months of protests that have already lasted since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on December 1 in the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", Rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Christmas broadcast on Canadian television.
Private television channel CTV today announced that Anderson, along with the "crowner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on December 1st in the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and drown a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program, in which Anderson - also for the distribution on the Internet of self-directed porn, in which she together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears - as a virgin Mary with a doll on the shoulder, the Jesus
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent who recently worked as a moderator on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" broadcast, appears as Jesuskind.
CTV’s Christmas program not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
At one of his concerts in New York, Bublé recently called North American Kim Kardashian a "hure".
Japan Reborn After Earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the free fall spiral from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that sparked a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had experienced in World War II.
The government’s first estimates in Tokyo estimated the damage to <0x24>300,000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of cases, data on gross domestic product were used to finalize this chapter from July to September: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the year-on-year quota.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The resurgence can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decrease of 0.9% for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of steady rises.
Nevertheless, the real shift in the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on keysanian stimuli that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan is awake, in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, due to increasing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has relied on the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refugee currencies" of investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the turbulent forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege, which is like a gravestone on the accounts of the exports.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results from July to September back to the listing of the yen.
While the markets continue to be occupied by the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"You have to pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid revaluation of the yen," said Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member states showed clearer signs of slowing economic development in September.
The indicator, which predicts the turning points of the global economy, pointed out that the biggest economic potentials would have been slowed down.
It dropped by four tenths to a loss of 100.4 points compared to the 10.8 points in August.
The eurozone is even below this average of 100, after it dropped eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high-risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece continues to get lost in the labyrinth that emerges from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is rather a reaction to pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly evidenced by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days of his appointment may have been too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party, nematum, reassured to the New Democracy, that his February, Antoni, was not going to be too short for their implementation.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the October 26 summit," Papadimos said yesterday to open a parliamentary debate that will reach its peak tomorrow with the confidence vote for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
However, Samara’s communication does not express any doubts about his attitude: “We are committed to supporting the transitional government, but to nothing else.”
The conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the agency that needs to unlock the 8000 million Athens urgently needed, making it clear that he would not welcome a declaration of commitment on the implementation of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which would still be annoyed by the impact of the game of poker with Papandreu referendum, yesterday reaffirmed its demand not to be shaken: The economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties could not agree on such a "single" letter.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the Troika inspectors would return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is necessary for the payment of the sixth section" in the amount of 8000 million euros, although it is still there.
The Greek knee has threads for a while.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "predominant" position on this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position globally in the role of small-financing".
Queen Sofia of Spain reminded yesterday that Spain has become the second donor to international cooperation in the last two decades. Its "essence" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for people's social progress" based on the hope of justice and the hope of hope for people.
The queen yesterday dedicated the fifth world summit on small loans in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely indispensable" in order to get under the number of people, the target range of the "millennials" by 2015.
Spain "continues to work" on the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it is carrying out this task responsibly", Queen Sofia noted, hoping that the initiatives and contributions that will come from the summit, which will be held as the most effective" until Thursday, will go on to ensure that the women and women who are in this category, "the sheep"
"We have recorded many successes" and "have faced many challenges."
The summit on small loans is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform to promote "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen said it is aimed at providing access to these financial services to 175 million poor families by the end of 2015, and that ten million of these households will cross the poverty line.
The concept of small loans in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the “road initiated by Muhammad Yunus years ago” which Queen Sofia considers to be an “act of justice and recognition”.
She described her father as a “admirable idealist dedicated to the fight against poverty” and whose work she knew for 15 years when the queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first world summit in Washington and other meetings on the ivory coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all of them, "we are able to observe a continuous development," said the queen, whose commitment to this project was a "speak" as a "member" and her assessment as a "Valenomillion" in yesterday.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her lecture by animating the attendees to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical commandment" for the whole democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid in times of economic boom, since it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that small loans are a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty" and that the governments of industrialized countries should now work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim to.
For Spain, small loans are one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, lamented "the success", "marginalized" people, "who are always standing at closed doors" to give "hope" and to the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, said the attendees of the "will to come to a city."
The CDU proposes to elect the President of the EU on the basis of general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU) on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig was held for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was originally not foreseen in the programme, but has been implemented in the autumn, in particular in order to provide enough for those activists who consider the government policy of the Greeks today and possibly tomorrow of Italy to be too lax.
The proposal by the Presidency of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The several-minute standing ovation, which was first applied to Angela Merkel and a few hours later to Wolfgang Schäuble due to their intervention permits, was open to any doubt by the three European finance ministers.
The main idea of the Chancellor - as well as the request - bears the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but there are also "nine million jobs directly dependent on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in an amendment of the Treaty of Lisbon, which strengthens the control of the European Union, with regard to the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro area; however, this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general voting, "to give Europe a face".
However, this is certainly one of the proposals adopted by Congress, which clearly stood Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 will agree quickly on this revolution: Grob Britain is faced with a rejection of the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, in an overwhelming majority, the delegates rejected the proposal to weigh each country on the Governing Board of the ECB in accordance with the weighing of the individual economies, which obviously led to a strengthening of Germany’s position.
The chancellor, who has been thinking about calming the climate within her party, has therefore reinforced the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or those in difficulty European countries, which are in need of immediate access to Germany.
Insofar as the European request focuses on the importance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call on France.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does fraud represent in case of disease reports?
Following the family subsidies, UMP and the government are now attacking the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family support fund and to present a speech on the theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been repeated since 2007.
To accompany this attack, which is based on the effort to undergo a hard test on the economy, but on the other hand is no less a pretext of a right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee complaints.
First of all, with a budgetary objective: the government recommends the introduction of a fourth day of care before taking into account a disease report among private sector workers.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose a four-day salary without the permission of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A mass capture, which, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to invoke anger, but would help to raise <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>280 million.
And this was accompanied by another rather symbolic assumption: to allow the public officials an unrewarded Karenztag in the case of illness (unlike the three Karenz days in the private sector, so far there is no Karenztag for them).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also re-examined the fraud theme, this time targeting the abuse associated with absence of work.
"Controls will be significantly more important, and moreover, they are to be compensated if required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13, in front of the RTL broadcaster's microphone.
As in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of disease reporting seem somewhat disproportionate.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002, as well as of political offensives that have carried the most fruit.
The French are no more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let’s start with the country-wide figures.
According to the CNAM, more than 237 million euros of daily debits were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute of Economic Research and Documentation of Health, the daily expenses in 2008 accounted for 5% of health expenditure of 11.3 billion euros.
This amount included 46% for maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% for sickness leave, amounting to 6.2 billion euros.
and 2.5% of health expenditures.
In 2010, compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, only 14.5 days were granted to the French, on average, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
An average that conceals certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they did not take a single sick day.
Another study, this time recorded by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of disease reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Thus, compared to their European neighbours, French workers tend to be unemployed only elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (based on disease or otherwise) oscillated, i.e. 18% in France, between 10% and 11% in the market, and 16% in the market, compared to 16% in the market and 28% in the D.
The fraud in disease reports represents a disappearing small proportion of black work.
With regard to fraud, only a weak outsourcing is achieved here.
Strengthening the legislation since 2002 means that there are systemic controls in cases of illnesses exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public college for training and further training of technicians and engineers) under 1.5 million checks found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term disease reports were "unjustified or too long" in 37,050 cases.
For the systematically controlled cases of more than 45 days, among 1.2 million 11% were "unreasonable or unjustified" cases, which is 132,000.
Thus, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases occur on several million workers who have claimed a disease report.
A figure that represents only a weak outsourcing vs., for example, those of black work.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a factual report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profits per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore significantly more than the amount of fraud.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme to capture its economy.
This had been announced by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament on Monday, November 14, adding the fact that the one hundred days granted by his government by the Union were not enough to carry out this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners as well as a new budget adjustment programme," the head of government said in his first public address at the opening of the debate on Parliament's confidence vote on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Euro Summit on 27 October is the "main task" of the new government, as the country's involvement within the eurozone was "on the game", he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos planned to reduce the country's state deficit "by 9%" of GDP from today until the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new savings
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right wing, on Monday had given his consent to the already approved takeovers with regard to an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but anticipated that his party would not be prepared for an additional takeover.
"We will not vote in favour of new votes," he said at a parliamentary assembly of his New Democracy Party.
He had declared himself ready for the reduction of budget deficit and debt, as well as for the fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would stop the economic upheaval.
Olli Rehn, with EU economic and monetary tasks commissioner who had prevented the IMF and the EU from delivering the necessary loan over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties about their support of the planned withdrawals, had not responded to Antonio Samaras’ response.
Euthanasia and accompanying freedom must be legalized, so an expert panel
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The committee explained that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors have worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, even beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian society is living in a refusal attitude towards death.
Only 9% of Canadians are actually allowed to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts linked to each other in various disciplines, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the Penal Code so as to allow accompanying suicide and euthanasia where this election takes place, in patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As a starting point, the experts cited a recently published survey of the independent company EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that “medical death care in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to cut the issue of death.”
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians’ desire to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die in the hospital.
In Quebec, the rate of deaths in hospitals is the highest, with 86%.
In the delicate question concerning euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report conclude that the position of the federal government, which has already advocated no amendments to the Penal Code with regard to euthanasia and accompanying suicide, should not be taken into account.
But now, according to the experts, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would not be misused in their application, i.e., the implementation of a practice of euthanasia or self-determination.
On the contrary, there are significantly more cases of such violations in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, confirmed yesterday at a teleconference.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
"Even accompanying suicide is being practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Let’s face it, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey, 85% of Canadians had already voted in favor of euthanasia, as they believe it allowed people to alleviate their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing euthanasia does not result in conveying the message that the lives of older or disabled people are of less value.
As for those who have already committed an accompanying suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or discontinuing the funds in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
In the same way, they indicate in their Recommendation Directory that the Penal Code should specify that the disposal of funds for which a legal refusal is made should not be considered criminal.
The panel of experts also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the end-of-life disbursement of funds, and to be afraid to do so without criminal prosecution.
The committee explained that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors have been working together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, even beyond cancer cases.
Lastly, the Commission calls on the Commission to consider at least this at least as little as euthanasia has been used to reduce the amount of pain relief or life-threatening treatments already used in Canadian health institutions, and to use them to reduce the risk of euthanasia.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already made reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the signatory experts as "extreme", among other things, as these do not set any limits on euthanasia practice in patients in the final stage.
“This opens the door to a situation in which anyone who is tired and over 18 years of age is asking another person to help him in his suicide,” said RA Deschamps, who reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual’s own responsibility over all other values involved in the social sphere of society.
But now, he says, there are "guides and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she called a "pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular, doubts the reports on the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls President Assad to Resign
Damascus announces a "conspiracy"
Syria is seemingly more isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure on Syria, however, against Bashar al-Assad, who, thanks to Russia’s support, has shown itself to be a “conspiracy” against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before the expulsion of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of President Assad’s resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the incumbent Arab prime minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to “deposit his authority in Syria” in which the 40 civilians and members of the government were killed.
“Bashar lies in the heart of his country’s interest, so he would resign, but in addition, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life,” Jordan’s king, Syria’s neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu complained that the Turkish mediation attempts aimed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot be satisfied with them, must go," he said, referring to Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "strengthening consensus on Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“International community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have struck an ever-increasing tone in the face of the repressions in Syria,” said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government have died in the Dar'a region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians were killed in "shooting changes and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
On the occasion of a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless considered that the country was "steering towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has responded with emphasis on the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which he considers to be a "dangerous step".
"Syria will not surrender," he added, adding that "the plots forged against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé had also expressed his support for the dispatch of UN observers in order to protect civilians from regime repressions that would encapsulate him in his "Paranoia".
An extraordinarily planned new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to implement the plan decided on November 2, but in particular the controversial, likely withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the release of detainees to protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League’s decision “incorrect” yesterday to avoid endorsing possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already warned Syria to implement the crisis outage plan.
ITALY
Monti calls on markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian head of government, has asked markets to take a little more time to form his staff and implement a program that "victims" are demanding to regain the credibility lost during the last months of the government of Berlusconi.
The former EU Commissioner had held talks with the political parties before today’s meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which consisted of relatively strict external technocrats.
"Monti talked about an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, the president of the House of Representatives, for his part, had been waiting for Mario Monti to put a vote of confidence to Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by Mr Monti of a deletion list that will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to Head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness of the stock and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government as well as a government program, he stressed, noting that there is "certainty that markets will show themselves patient and understanding".
His order by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had escalated further, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The current prime minister was expected to establish a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he also liked to involve "politicians".
The new government should only last until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the House of Representatives, the new government should receive Parliament's credentials by Friday.
Since taking office, Mr Monti has committed himself to working with urgency in order to make Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "it does not change our diagnosis with regard to the Italian economy itself, taking into account the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance target in 2013 despite the savings plans taken in recent months, in particular, has called for new hard-to-reach measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, Italy's chief executive, who will meet in Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for an economic curve, "for a country that has no growth that cannot respect deficit figures".
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epoch change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenge of credibility" and a "other Italy", according to the authors.
The big unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent pre-elections, as Italy will have to raise <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 billion in government bonds by April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Energy Program
A Russian scientist, Wyatcheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-enabled propellant, an American nuclear-risk NGO confirmed on Monday.
The ISIS Institute for Science and International Security is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (AIEA) and other documents from this UN agency to investigate this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its "serious concern" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to an in-depth study of AIEA documents by ISIS, the 1934-born Danilenko had apparently worked in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamantics produced by the explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he was said to have left the center to start a company in Kiev that produces "nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him in 1995 to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine.
Before his return to Russia, he then collaborated on an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA referred to "strong evidence that Iran's development of a nuclear explosive system" was supported by the work of a foreign expert who has not only migrated into this technique, but has also been instrumental in its work, as a member of the state, and can be found on his agency's technology.
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated violence, according to the FBI statistics released on Monday, has either slightly declined or only slightly increased over the same period.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is 49%, while a 13% increase in crimes against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews, and a global increase in crimes against anti-Christians.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" has risen to 6,628 cases in a very weak amount, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes grow again," Human Rights First said. "The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, the organization's official.
“The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks,” he added, adding that this could be done by improving the police attitude towards the ‘hate crimes’.
The "hate crime" is a legacy of the era of the civil rights struggle in U.S. federal law.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish violent acts directed against race, color, religion or ancestry, and now also involves crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and more and more like Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter on Monday introduced changes to the presentation of its platform to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service more like that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" enable a better readable live tracking of the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") they track and track your messages.
This allows you to find out if they allow you to track your messages, if you subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday "at a low percentage of users", Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, equipped with some esoterically mute wording (RT to refer to another person’s posts). followfriday to recommend following another user) making the happiness of initiates, thus opening up a wider audience with a larger Facebook<0x2B> with a much larger approach to Facebook and a network of audiences comparable to that of others.
In the network, users debated this innovation with the help of certain "Tweets" over the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and very similar to Facebook," <0x40>jemb123 wrote.
“The ‘activity’ feature will help me track certain elements of my stream Twitter better,” <0x40>dannykronstrom said.
Austrian
Registration of a "golden budget rule" in the Constitution
The government of the great Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to incorporate a "golden budget rule" into the constitution to reduce public deficits and also a possible degradation by rating agenciesA to the top-on.
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision on the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian public debt is at 74.6%, i.e. far above the criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty of 60%, but clearly below Italy, like Italy or Spain, clearly below Grihal.
“If Austria’s solvency didn’t fall to one stroke from AAA to AA<0x2B>, we would have to pay an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion in interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria also holds a call for the Brussels summit of the eurozone Member States on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government would then have the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012, as well as a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or by endorsement.
The "German model" adopted by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to incorporate such a "rule" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, from 2017 the federal budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% threshold of GDP, while the regional states as well as the municipalities should balance households.
The aim is to eliminate the budgetary debt in 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement.
Starker Yen
Noda threatens with new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again in the currency markets if the yen continued to rise.
"If we are to establish excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, we will intervene as we did the last time," Noda said in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was again accelerated near the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold the yen against the dollar in order to lower the Japanese currency’s value, which is setting a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has regularly risen above it, doped by purchases by investors who see the yen as a “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic slump and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, while the euro is sliding below the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar noted about 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This spark of Japanese currency damages the archipelago’s exports as it sells the cost of “Made in Japan” products and reduces the value of income withdrawn by Japanese companies from abroad as they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11 that devastated the Tohoku region," said Noda, who fears that this decomposition of the yen could kill the weak upheaval already in the seed.
The third economic power, with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year thanks to the jumping increases in exports and consumption of households "plombed" by the disaster, has regained traction.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the depreciation of the yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to dismantle the Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, the institute’s deputy governor, has noted that BoJ has already initiated “appropriate takeovers”, leaving it credible that no additional currency lockdown is expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the Notenbank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to cover the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) it had spent on various purchases of financial securities.
Eurozone:
Interest rates speed up, stock exchanges make withdrawals
The contagious risk of the debt crisis continues to infinitely limit the European figures.
Despite the appointment of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, also drifted a little further into negative fields on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 p.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
“Due to the new tensions regarding the yields of government bonds in the eurozone in difficulty, the global stock markets are continuing to issue some of their recent profits.
“Capital investors are nervous and are only too well aware of the risk of infection,” Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn suffers from the renewed fear of market participants as to the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis would continue, had closed with a drop of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management, said in a statement.
This revival of concerns about the future of the eurozone is detrimental to the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 p.m., the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollars, so it was 0.4%.
According to the exchange brokers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had met in congress on Monday, made a request, which in particular provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% threshold.
The loan rates in Italy and Spain are still at a very disturbing level.
On Tuesday morning, the return on Italian bonds reached 6.85% for 10 years, the return on Spanish bonds reached 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
The future Italian head of government Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy threatened by the debt burden of paralysis.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Eurozone summit on October 27 is "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the visibility of the markets, as parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The interest rate spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
Expecting growth figures in the euro area
Statistically speaking, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, which was slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office of INSEE had revised the decline in figures for the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries the economic experts the most.
Germany, for its part, had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The euro area is expected to have its first recess at 11 a.m., with the European Commission warning of the risk of a recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be addressed on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, then this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to start an election meeting, to think about this topic, as well as the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, the demographic evolution drives a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, a huge proportion of the world’s population should not have to give up a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to mitigate the shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity consistently, without forgetting the imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which undermines its decision to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which intends to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, in turn, decided to join another unit in its park after Fukushima by reopening the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model, which is based on renewable energy sources, is occasionally set as a model, the reality is contrary to the discourse.
The elections in Berlin will take the form of a depreciation of the electricity price, an increased energy dependence on imports, especially Russia, and an increase in CO2 emissions from gas and coal power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will become noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives us reason to think about it.
Denmark, on the one hand, is the European wind energy table leader, from which it accounts for 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, Denmark is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, used in turn with wind energy; on this basis, its CO2 emissions are equivalent to 50% of its electricity value and 6 % of its electricity value.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill compared to our French households.
As the energy price plays a key role in the globalised economy, as well as an industry’s stance on national stability, French companies have an advantage because of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in energy prices, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys have found that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are willing to pay just as little as they recognize resistance to the principle of this energy source.
We present that the energy policy of our country has enabled us to build an industry with 125,00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a multitude of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France decides to step out of nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs will be affected, and the annual <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion in investment goods and nuclear exports will shrink more and more.
Which electrician would hire a 60-year EPR designed to operate if the decline of its producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one must admit that there is as little a devil work as a miracle means of generating electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy reflect the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of security is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that performs uncompromising and transparent checks in existing factories such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are currently obsessed with the concept of security.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, so it hasn’t had any consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was sworn in by the construction of a reactor as well as the innocence of human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, causing the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it did after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach and the cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German nuclear power plants operators and builders, the EPR represents a draft that enables it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by giving them a free trail, the leadership position in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is inevitable and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that equally determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or opportunity for the economy?
Nicolas Sarkozy’s immigration policy has been criticized from many angles – overloading police, judiciary and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a “country of human rights”, as France itself had called it.
Recently, the government’s harassment of foreign students had marked the weekly look, the interior minister had randomly announced (see May 23 release) that France “does not need talent, Maurer or waiter from abroad”.
But this policy has rarely been analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus between the right and the left on this issue.
On the right side was attacked by Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", on the left by Michel Rocard, who had described in 1990, France "cannot take on the whole world's poverty".
The only difference is in the degree of volatility
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish clamps was shared in 2005 by both the right and left.
From both camps, the immigrants were perceived as a burden to the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of volatility that one is willing to admit to immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Hollande confines himself to banalities that suggest that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present us in a recent work that summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011), an outlook of the Princeton University Press, 352.
Restricting immigration would discourage growth and damage the labour market situation.
Concerns about the influence of migrants are based on the notion that they threaten to replace the domestic workforce, especially the less qualified, by exercising pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact considerably more complementary than domestic wage workers, as they focus on working in sectors that are technically unemployed.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors where local wage workers travel less, who work more skilled among immigrants in dynamic sectors where training is not compatible with the job offer.
Positive pay effect
Just as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity between locals and migrants also has a positive effect of immigration withdrawal on wages and domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the immigration flow would lead to a corresponding, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity introduced by immigrants is attributable to the creation of ideas as well as to economic growth (a high proportion of citizen immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to the social systems, with an average of about 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 contributes a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to the public budget on average over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to mention the missing intersections "with his teeth" in the course of his mandate.
However, these teeth, which should discourage immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now it remains to think about European democracy.
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a delicate asset.
The European continent should be able to remember itself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, overcame the entire 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Colonel in Greece.
Some would have believed that it was sufficient to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy conquering its enemies once and for all.
Since Napoleon "the Little One" it is known that this was a characteristic of the attitude of the mind.
The general right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient condition for this and can just as well become a "instrument of oppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, an education, education, an economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe, in which we are, is an economic crisis, but it is also a political and democratic crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek Truth-False Referendum would have had a double-disclosure character in this regard: one of the necessity of a vigorous return of politics, on the other hand, but also one of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its inconvenience.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the frontlines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer heading in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to push for the success of the national referendum, which was organized according to the needs and in the wrong order.
A freelancer for the European ruler alone or a leap of eyes into the emptiness of the nationalist retreat: A great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hacking, but a collective task, with full right, clarified and constant, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - by the way, we do not know where to end the enumeration - since there is only one crisis, and this one prevails in Europe.
The whole of Europe is bent on the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its powerlessness and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at the international level.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - the whole of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every individual of the nations that are associated with it.
The urgency is to give the people's sovereignty back to the leadership of the European project.
For it is up to the Europeans as a whole whether they can reduce the burden of their debt, free themselves from the markets, and forge a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis is a condition for decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy without causing us to be completely ruined.
After this proposal was fought for a long time by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone today urges European economic leadership to do so.
Agree.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it suggests to the citizens - would be a new folly and a further craziness.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to create the republic in France, the fact needed to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not suffice here.
This teaching will continue to be valid.
We need to create a better integrated Europe at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become the general good
The World Fair for Chipcards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 should actually end with an 11 percent increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards) with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most supportive segment is contactless technology, which enables payments in public transport or the comparison of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year ago, 460 million contactless chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide this year!
Its market share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and account for over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe wins in terms of contactless land payments after it has long been backwards in the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept these.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were distributed.
Consumer markets, however, make steam.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCards this year.
In order to move faster, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
“Two major French financial institutions have committed to systematically delivering their customers bank cards equipped with contactless chips in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile
However, this is only a first step on the way to the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
A disappearing low percentage of devices is so far equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
"They're in delay".
"But they should at least experience a real upswing next year."
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks took the initiative.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also said yesterday to prepare for the market launch of an offer that allows its customers to contactless payments via mobile.
Terrorist front is understood, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationship between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-suspicious relationship between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seems to confirm itself.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself had confirmed that Algiers had now "acquired certainty" about this.
"The way the two organizations are doing and the relationships of the intelligence services suggest a clear cooperation," he said without going into the details.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
Investigations on the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January have encouraged intersections.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by followers of the Aqmi, are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers were killed on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators have found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the wreckage at the site.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the led phone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, who was the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who stands as the Nakhed Se and Aqmi.
"This is a progression, but there is no doubt more clear evidence to be expected before we can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem".
"However, it is conceivable".
“We have known for years that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from Auven and that it is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "support services" have become more and more apparent in their course, as have Boko Harem's speeches and operations modes, which have now been used to attract suicide bombers and the use of suicide bombers, such as the handwriting of these explosives, which have become more and more complex.
Since then, the international community has been putting pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have in fact long regarded the group as a community of Illuminati, which should not be given special attention.
Fast Successes
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means as much as "Western education is a shame" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this impoverished region, the merger is a rapid success.
She politicizes herself and demands strict adherence to the Sharia, while the activists who join her engage in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in sight.
In 2009, Boko Haram’s activists were particularly active with their increased attacks on the commissions.
However, Abuja’s reaction is as usual indifferent.
The army encircles the city, with 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was imprisoned, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming more radical and leaves its high forts in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an assassination in Jos that claimed 80 lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is charged with a suicide bombing at Abuja’s secure police headquarters, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will become the priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is supposed to lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, has since alarmed all security experts.
While Aqmi Mali and Niger have occupied the Somali operations of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem appears to be a new threat at the center of the continent.
Last week, on the occasion of a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned of Boko Harem and showed himself willing to "commit any clues".
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
With Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-stricken America lead a complex world with simple, not to say: one-sided ideas?
If you listen to Republican presidential candidates like that, voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their comrades have made repeated reluctance to make their outrageous statements, as well as their statements about the outlawing policy, a traditional Republican focus.
There are slogans about China, Iran and Israel’s aid – often underpinned in no way.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", the highest-ranking Mitt Romney threatened to cite the Chinese before the WTO and quote them of the "currency manipulation" - a leading topic in an America that is irritated at the forefront by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
“It went silly if this is meant to imply the start of a trade war,” he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of auven policy, has almost shrunk the air in terms of his emotion-smiling gebar.
He had called for a hands-on but constructive exchange of talks with Beijing (also Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman is not being heard as he stagnates in the depths of the polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran if sanctions to stop the nuclear program were to fail.
"If I'm elected, I'll give Iran a stop," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb".
In addition, he has promised Israel reinforced military assistance and accused Obama of remaining guilty to this partner’s commitments.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-placed candidate, in turn, brings to the show a shameful file knowledge.
Recently, he called for the Chinese military threat to counter Beijing's "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and it seemed to ignore the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, in turn, announces that he is ready to take on the US military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The 2009 Obama ban on the use of torture against suspected terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an autistic political heavyweight.
Contrary to current presidential contractors, Reagan has also had simple ideas and still won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give water to his wine on the issue of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive talks with Iran, the deliberate withdrawal of his “young” from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also gave him the reputation of weakness.
This attack, however, is not entirely unforced.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive balance of National Security under Obama, which has shut down Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding itself against military interventions that lead to praise.
And Obama is more decently surprised by arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt in order to revive its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is expected to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to do this event with splendor and Gloria.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea level, on the Baltic Sea coast last Tuesday under orchestra noise and at a fine-tasting buffet.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have symbolically jointly turned the control of the valve, which transports Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas will be delivered to Western Europe each year through a first 1,224 km long pipeline that connects the region of St. Petersburg to West Pomerania.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas – the equivalent of French total consumption – to be completed at the end of 2012.
And the possibility of building a third line on the same route is already being made.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this huge building seems like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, avoiding any traffic flows by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the road.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of their power: it will now be more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to western European markets.
Warsaw, most heavily involved in the debate, was not shy about comparing the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pact" in connection with the Hitler-Stalin Alliance for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the topic is politically extremely sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of a dismantling of European energy, as the project has struck a gap between western and eastern Europeans.
In barely five years, Russia has completed implementing its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich western countries that have strong gas consumption and whose gas operations are inclined.
“This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way,” François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the major gas agreements are also important from the political and economic side.
All this explains the wide smile of the numerous Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin in terms of gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipe is made of steel with concrete mounting, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at approximately 200 m depth.
During its construction, mining fields dating from World War II had to be evacuated.
"About a hundred mines had to be removed or destroyed with caution," said Jens Müller, a spokesman for the Nord Stream company.
In addition, reinforced land grabs had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long string of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is interrupted throughout the entire length by nothing: neither valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was provided off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have refrained from doing so, as the Swedish government had little desire to see a Russian state company settle permanently at the level of its coasts.
"In the event of a havarie, we close the gas passage in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered unlikely by the designers, as the suede seams were estimated to be resistant to a leak every 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot, which is controlled for external observation purposes from a marine vessel, and by an apparatus circulating within the gas pipeline.
It has the form of a cigar, mi<0xCE><0xB2>t a meter of diameter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and moved forward by the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on possible deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo even the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have united their forces to implement this project.
However, the line management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF (depending on 15.5%), as well as the Dutch gas company and the French company group GDF Suez (depending on 9%).
These five companies have formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company, on an extended twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the amount of gas actually transported will fall out," said Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% by shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs are expected to amount to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the total investment amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders have decided to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline runs on a sandy, pine-forested coastline at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the gas outlet section.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transmitted to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal is supplied with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to re-establish a new style of writing.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent at candlestick with writing.
Moleskine’s notebook is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular band, rubber band, egg-colored sides, as they age over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided to launch a distinguished design notebook at the time.
Maria Sebregondi, the company’s then expert advisor, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique, called Mole Skin, which designates a cotton lacquer, which is used, for example, for covers of paddle benches.
This type of notebook was very popular among writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has resurrected an old and almost forgotten object that was considered an icon of avant-garde artist until the 20th century,” explains Maria Sebregondi, now a brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes in.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and settled with a turnover of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a ghost image of buyers, as the notebook enthuses both business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which initially employed 12 people, now employs over 100 people and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in book stores, on internet portals like Fnac, in small boutiques in the city centres and agrees to implement its identity.
“We are following the spirit of time and its new writing requirement, which persists despite the rise of emails,” Maria Sebregondi said.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg) ", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, the company also launched a band with leopard patterns.
Moleskine took advantage of its success and this cultural spirit and understood how to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer envelopes... The brand features the entire range of articles.
In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, and thus launched a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th Week of Work for Disabled People".
Despite a targeted public policy, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is always twice as high as the average: 19% versus 9% of the total population’s unemployment.
Discouraging?
"No," said Éric Blanchet, director-general of the Association Adapt, which targets the 'Week of Work for the Disabled'.
"The progress made in the course of fifteen years is significant."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not double, but triple that high."
"Notwithstanding, there is still a lot to be done."
However, it must be said that many obstacles continue to exist for the disabled unemployed before they get a job.
More often, it affects the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them do not have a bachelor’s degree and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with a higher education degree.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% among the disabled compared to 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-introduce work, and that form the "core of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the actual brakes.
The unspeakable remains, the mental attitudes, which, of course, continue to evolve, but still slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS Entrepreneur Association for the magazine La Cité stated that the managers surveyed had "a weak level of knowledge about people with disabilities" that was "overrepresented" by "people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disadvantaged".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was set out in a 1987 law.
These last figures, dating back to 2008, refer to a percentage of 2.6%.
“We are now at about 3%,” reports Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that disregarded this law.
Evidence: The number of "fees paid" by establishments has decreased, as has the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on companies,” said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also brings true insights, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the workplaces employ disabled workers between 20 and 49 employees, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What luck"
Already before they offered the "Blue Tuesday evening" (20:45 p.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not had their pleasure, which brought them the game of friendship.
It would have been too far-reaching to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator’s podium at the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been able to make peace.
Five months after his attacker’s temperamental gesture against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," assures the born Liller in turn.
As for the contrast between his performance in club and national elf, "It's a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille I am all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to go to the start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis on Friday evening against Romania in terms of the match against France to finally "gloss".
However, without abandoning the note of "fun".
The French national team has been fired since the age of 7 and led his victorious field races between 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been supported,” he said.
This necessarily contributes to further strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Matthew (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he presents.
"We've just crossed the road."
"To play against them means great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, clung to "silence" with kindness.
"The Pride of a Galamatch."
"Proud" also to confirm - in his capacity as "neighbors" - that France"has become a team at a very high level again", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to see the plane share with the Blues (the French national elf) ... heading for Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians are coming rough out," he stressed.
"We're planning a thing, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll notice this in the upcoming games". The game against France involved.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward to the return against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
During the match, both teams missed the fact.
“At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national elf, for whom he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, that means, in fact, only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to serve an opponent, namely Bosnia.
Given the (0-0) match on Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the cubes have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to press the matter on the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but it poses a certain risk as we have not achieved an external gateway."
At home, however, in their brightly radiant Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to beat themselves in front of an audience that should be equally keen on the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very scarce", but optimistic Bento said.
“We expect a very short match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can win the top hand,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be at the 2012 European Championships," said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The indecisiveness in Bosnia on Friday forces the Portuguese to reach a goal and win.
An indecision can already suffice the Bosnians, who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but it poses a certain risk as we have not reached an outside gate," Bento said.
"We will play against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese would have to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "don't give them time to think."
It is a good idea, provided it is implemented this time.
