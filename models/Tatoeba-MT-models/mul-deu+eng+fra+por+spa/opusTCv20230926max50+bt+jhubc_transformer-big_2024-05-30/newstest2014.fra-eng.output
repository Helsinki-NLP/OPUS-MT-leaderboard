Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" above Bogota
Athlet Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter over the Colombian capital Bogota on Thursday.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination of wings), it passed 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate shrine, located more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many badauds had gathered to observe its exploitation.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners find it hard to find the money they need to repair the downhill highway infrastructure, many are looking for a solution in the form of a small black box that is fixed above your car’s dashboard.
The devices, which record every mile travelled by a driver and transmit information to officials, are at the heart of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices to redesign the outdated funding system of major U.S. roads.
The generally uninteresting sector in major axes planning has suddenly sparked strong debate and moving alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to pressure the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you’re traveling, and possibly the road you’re traveling on, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party has landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress fail to agree on whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles traveled.
Thousands of motorists have already embarked on these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental turn.
This is truly essential for our nation.
“It’s not like we have a choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, CEO of the Southern California Association of Governments, who predicts that the state will start recording the miles each California driver drives by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, funded with taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don’t buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by 1 percent, while gasoline prices are high.
“The gasoline tax is simply not taxable,” said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed trackers on 500 cars to test a mileage payment system.
“It turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage fee.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces city liberals, as taxes could be used to change driving habits to reduce bumps and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state’s ambitious climate warming laws.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the Transport Committee of the House of Representatives, said he also considered it the most viable long-term alternative.
The Free Market supporters of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay for the mile.
“It’s not just a tax bumping into a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of politics at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go the mile payment path.
The U.S. Senate approved a <0x24>90 million pilot project last year that would have carried about 10,000 cars.
But the House presidency killed the proposal, responding to concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or to the city.
However, several states and major cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the most important experience in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state kilometre fees instead of fuel taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
Illinois is trying a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 road transport agencies in U.S. states along the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer drivers have recently equipped their car with an appliance, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their slightest facts and gestures.
“Concerns about Big Brother and this kind of thing are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategic Performance Management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
From the start of the trial, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website, “It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into fully-fledged location devices.”
It is not necessary to build a huge and overwhelming technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people’s daily avenues and arrivals.
Nevada is one of the few states that are now moving to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do this, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
Research into this technology has led some state agencies to resort to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help drivers who pay taxes to the states.
She was looking to break into the emerging car insurance market, where drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices she tested pleased the planners of the big axes because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information, regularly downloaded by modem.
“People will be more inclined to do that if you don’t record their speed and locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less expensive ways and much less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have an appliance at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than enough.
In New York City, transport managers are looking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide a “driving payment” insurance, and create a real-time data set of speeds from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Automobilists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them,” said a paper on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder if the whole debate on mile payment is not just a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very simply manage the Highway Trust Fund’s bankruptcy by increasing fuel taxes.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and on others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
“There is no need to resort to radical surgery when you simply need aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s Director of Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unpublished Listening
The English musician did not end up surprised this year.
Starting from The Next Day, released in January, it has produced a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several new releases.
Four have already emerged on the canvas.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone in slippery slope.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last album, Reality, dated 2003) and too rare public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be trusted to spark the pop scene.
A party for its fans
Not surprisingly, David Bowie had more than one round in his bag with The Next Day.
Thin White Duke plans to re-release the album on November 4.
For the occasion, he made a real party for his fans.
This reissue, titled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared to the original album: the three tracks from the Deluxe edition, five specially unveiled songs for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a notebook to share its own impressions, a booklet with the words...
And, above all, it gives a taste of its new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and cleverly controlled rock power.
Unreleased already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the canvas.
The Informer is double-faced: a worrying intro before a luminous cavalry that gradually slows down to leave room for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John’s Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems at least in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next to it, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his oddity: would he come from another planet?
Guitar riffs, enchanting, give desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie enjoys playing camel with these titles: informant turn-to-turn, man on board a rocket, Martian potential...
He hides and reveals at the same time, playing to adopt different personalities, as he did throughout his career, including with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
Not surprisingly, he has a mask on his hand in the photograph of the campaign L’Invitation au Voyage, by the Louis Vuitton brand, of which he embodies the new face.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from November 10.
Defense Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transitional process was being followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and Neo-Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that prior to their release, members of the army followed a transitional plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life, and none of them are released before they are ready, he said.
The detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing the injured military - who do not meet the rule of "universal service" of the army requiring that staff be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the eligibility period of 10 years.
They cited two cases reported by the Canadian Press, including one of a soldier released last Friday.
Colonel David Hawkins, a London, Ontario reservist with post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the military despite his request to stay for another year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case came after Colonel Glen Kirkland, who said before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not respond to the universality rule of the service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different from the fact that he wanted to leave the ranks.
“I told them I wasn’t ready,” he said in an interview with the Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has hardly determined how wide it can give wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks but are not capable of fighting.
Under the current rules, seriously wounded soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted to Parliament last year indicates that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the service life required to obtain retirement benefits.
Liberal veteran spokesman Jim Karygiannis called for the reintegration of Colonel Hawkins on Wednesday, while neo-Democrat Jack Harris called for the immediate end of “this shameful practice.”
Disney sets on tablets to launch animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to prioritize the tablets to its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie’s Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its mobile and tablet app.
Its global launch on the Disney group’s channels is only scheduled for 2014, according to a statement from its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, designed for children aged 2 to 7, tells the adventures of Callie, a sheriff of a western American city where she makes the order rule with a magic lasso.
Each episode contains two 11-minute stories.
“Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today,” said Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group.
This kind of experience comes as part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are increasingly important,” he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 have already used a tablet or a phone, and 72% of children under 8 years of age, compared to 10% and 38% two years ago, respectively.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the complainant of the U.S. intelligence services, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he is entitled to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter to the Berlin media on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: “While the result of my efforts has obviously been positive, my government continues to treat the difference as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to abandon the criminal charges held against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make this possible.”
Relations between the U.S. and Germany have been severely tested as a result of complaints that the NSA has put on the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Snowden as a witness “without putting him in danger and completely ruining relations with the United States,” it should be taken advantage of.
Mr. Ströbele, a German Green MP, posted a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to former NSA counsel, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden was testifying in Germany, he should be assured that he would be “safe” there, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a “serious and sustained” persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – felt that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public use.
The letter forwards an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been solved”.
Cogeco Cable Could Soon Offer Interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix video service on demand via their TV in a future that doesn’t seem so far away.
Cogeco’s subsidiary said on Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary testing of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
“This will allow us to highlight more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options,” Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet said in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus pushes its competitors, such as Bell, even though the Cogeco subsidiary has not yet a precise date as to this new platform.
“We have to adapt and change or resist change and fail,” Audet said.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service is said to be in discussions with some major cable distributors so that its service is available via their broadcasting platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable spokesman also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during his Throne speech on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for the services on the map.
“It’s been about two and a half years since we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important chain packages doesn’t work,” Audet said.
It hopes, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
“It will have to emerge from these discussions a new kind of reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television,” Cogeco’s CEO said.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and is expected to continue with industry in the spring.
In terms of results, Cogeco reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 <0xC2><0xA2> per share.
This represents a decrease in the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 <0xC2><0xA2> per share, of the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline by amortization costs related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the US-based Atlantic Broadband cable distributor for <0x24>1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after that which had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Entreprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
As for Cogeco’s revenues, they saw a growth of 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 <0xC2><0xA2> per share, down from the 45.7 million, or 93 <0xC2><0xA2> per share, of the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable’s revenue increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of customers of Cogeco Cable is up 5,546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about the number of clients fluctuating in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from one quarter to another with a very strong competition.
From horse to beef products
Horse meat has been uncovered in confectionery boxes of beef-based products, sold by two small British low-cost distribution labels, the food hygiene agency announced today.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA at a height of 1 to 5%.
"Because horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been included in the product," the British agency said.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe earlier this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France has been the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four people early Friday on Route 131, in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 p.m., a driver driving north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car arriving in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
Traffic was back to normal around 6:00 p.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to <0x24>100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to <0x24>100 for hand luggage and <0x24>2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them on board the plane.
The new baggage fee applies to bags placed in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free of charge.
Frontier said it would pay <0x24>25 if the fees were paid in advance and <0x24>100 if travelers only paid once at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the <0x24>100 was planned to encourage travelers to pay the fees in advance.
“We don’t want to pay that price,” she explained.
The airline began paying for the first and second baggage checked in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges put as many things as they could in hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no room in these compartments.
These fees are a way of ensuring that passengers carry less things on board.
O’Malley said the new fees will not really be used to raise money.
It is about making the most loyal Frontier customers understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their ticket on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger making the tail at a Border embarkation door could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the tail might have to pay <0x24>100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these fees before arriving at the door.
Frontier’s hand luggage fee will not apply before summer, although no date has been fixed.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other fees, but airlines love them.
They believe that the luggage handling costs are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people in Wall Street consider the addition of luggage fees as a sign that airlines are paying expensive enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them have not affected the luggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand luggage fee three years ago, and the low-cost company Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other airline to impose such fees is the Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit’s hand luggage costs were <0x24>50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently travelled on Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding door when passengers would discover the unusual hand luggage fees imposed by the company.
“I’ve never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire career,” he said.
I was expecting to see toothbrushes and a fight exploding at the door.
The plane was full, he added, “passengers were boarding at lightning speed.”
Border also acts as Spirit and charges <0x24>2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Border indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopen can with them, and those who take coffee can be booked for free.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to make it pay for drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline had followed.
Frontier’s decision to pay hand luggage fees when passengers do not buy their tickets directly from the airline is its final effort to encourage customers to visit its website.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz <0x24>10 to <0x24>25 for each ticket sold.
This prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of addressing an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their ticket through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced the miles premiums by 25% on a trip.
Thus, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would make it possible to earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat only in advance if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown, Denver, but her business is back and she loses money.
Revenues fell by 9% and its flying capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic attempted to redress Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA questioned an “internal error” and not hackers for website failure
The National Security Agency working in the shadow said Friday it was a bug that had caused the crash of its public site for a few hours, and not hackers as some claimed it online.
“NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during an expected update,” the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the breach was due to a distributed denial of service attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been broken for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one group of online hackers claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site by an DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The formerly ultra-secret NSA, once nicknamed the “No Such Agency”, has been under the fire of the projectors and has been heavily criticized in recent months as a result of a wave of revelations about its extensive programs of surveillance of communications at the national level, and the NSA’s stealth and foreign intelligence are part of the NBA.
This growing controversy around the agency has sparked many speculations that the incident this evening was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
The Delta City Centre is now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who are going to turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta promises not to let its employees down.
Employers have come to meet employees directly on site, they have met employees individually to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” says Delta Hotels Regional Director of Labour Relations, Félix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta takes place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that was the owner of that building had choices to make.
Whether he was reinvesting in the building to continue operating it, so there were tens of millions of investments while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else, and that's what happened," said Paul Arsenault, the holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the School of Management Sciences at UQAM.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totalling nearly 600 rooms will be launched in two years.
For Titan CEO, "Goodyear Amiens acquisition project starts with zero employee"
After failing to throw the sponge in January for the partial recapture of Amiens-Nord’s promised closure site, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tyre manufacturer Titan, says today, ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the plant counts.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced this on Monday, October 21.
After giving up the project to buy the plant in January, you will return today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of “so-called workers” who “work three hours” a day, “crazy” unions” targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this face-to-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best-paid.
If I've hurt someone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of taxation and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours disability France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
I don’t have any prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that produces good agricultural tyres, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need so much of this factory?
Titan does not need to buy this factory.
But, with the right price and competent workers, it’s worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the factory closure announcement, Goodyear had offered employees a good starting compensation, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, imagine that Titan buys at Goodyear the factory closed.
As a result, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other EU country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
Now, he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from the roughly 1,200 employees of Goodyear today.
Also, Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit down at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that CGT and Goodyear seal a start-up allowance agreement for all employees.
From now on, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Are you confirming it?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting compensation.
If all employees accept it, the factory purchase project starts with zero employee.
How can we give guarantees for the duration of use when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to agree with the CGT and Goodyear and Titan buys the factory, we have a good intention to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier's profit is declining, as airplane deliveries and orders decline
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15 percent drop in its net profit on Thursday, under the pressure of a drop in aircraft orders and deliveries during the third quarter and contractual issues in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft or information about whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial launch schedule by September next.
After the inaugural flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, it only flew three times, and then the question was whether the test phase was on the right track.
The results were not as predicted and the stock price dropped by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank, lowered his rating on Thursday, shifting from “sector performance” to “sector performance” due to the low potential of stock market increases over the next quarter or the next two quarters.
“While the drop in aircraft deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Division,” Cameron Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We believe that Bombardier will register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight testing program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is so far modest at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding energy efficiency and the potential for savings of the new airliner.
At present, the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, president and chief executive, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft is commercially operational.
Leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was advancing according to the schedule.
"The test aircraft has not remained on the ground longer than expected," Mr. Beaudoin said at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the flight's shutdown time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to make a first flight and schedule an update period, and that’s what we did.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to take off in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly afterwards, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier said it was evaluating the schedule for entry into service and will provide new information over the coming months.
“This slowdown in flight tests – albeit apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter closed on September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to <0x24>147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to <0x24>172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The result per adjusted action remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues declined slightly from <0x24>4.2 billion to <0x24>4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a result of 10 cents per share and revenue of <0x24>4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics division was <0x24>32.9 billion as of September 30, which is unchanged compared to December 31 of the previous year.
“In aviation, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and the general market conditions were disappointing,” said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aeronautics revenues fell by 13% to <0x24>2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, said revenues from this division had increased by nearly 11% to <0x24>2.1 billion.
The Transport Division’s order book totaled <0x24>32.6 billion as of September 30, a slight increase from December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have had problems with the execution of some major contracts.
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's stock price, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, chief financial officer of Google Inc, would sit on the board of directors, dropped from 8.5 percent to <0x24>4.83 on Thursday afternoon.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest aircraft manufacturer and closest competitor to Bombardier, said Thursday a 10% drop in its quarterly profit.
Two 23- and 27-year-old speleologists have been missing in a swamp under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, the Isère Rescue Spéléo reported on Friday.
They were spotted this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one warrior to practice and the other not, had left underground on Thursday around 9:30 p.m. to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We had no news of them since then, the same source said.
"Speleologists should have emerged at around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser at Spéléo Rescue.
Dozens of people on site
About twenty rescuers, ten civilians members of the French rescue Spéléo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
“This is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, passed the information to one of the rescue teams involved in the network,” explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers at the 13th Alpine Hunters Battalion in Chambéry were found "exhausted but not wounded".
They lost themselves in the network, turned on their steps while waiting for help, the prefecture said.
Feeding them, they should emerge from the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists’ union on Thursday called on its members to stop using Google and Yahoo’s online services the day after new revelations about the activities of U.S. and British intelligence services.
“The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo’s search engines and messaging until further notice,” she said in a statement.
The US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected mass information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by the journalists is as confidential as the contacts of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," said Michael Konken, president of the union, which claims 38,000 members.
Repeated fire: MP calls for resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
Minister Brigitte Gruwels’ project of “lifting” the signaling lamp posts in Brussels does not appeal to everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched a test project in the centre of Brussels on Thursday to paint 16 lighthouses in the region in the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The aim is to "increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the end, to paint all Brussels signalling lights, for an estimated cost of around one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who talks about "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
“Not happy to crazyly spend the Brussels money in the operation of relifting the colored signaling poles of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues its operations of the capital’s flamandization,” De Bock said in a statement.
After her yellow-mangue-black taxis, she finally painted herself in dark yellow-blue-black the posts of Brussels.
According to the MP, there is now "no more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brusselsers deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who himself runs the NVA program.
It is great time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
"For the record, Brigitte Grouwells was elected with only 2,245 votes, or 0.5% of Brussels!" concluded De Bock.
the Pont-de-Buis portico dismantled
The ecotax portal of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on site shortly after 10:00, and traffic on the country was diverted in the aftermath.
The decision of dismantling, announced by the Finistère Prefecture on Wednesday, was made by the company Ecomov, the gate manager.
This is the last of the three ecotax gates in operation in the Finistère department, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an Accessory Store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google-signed connected glasses.
They can thus acquire a headphone, a charger or a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for <0x24>50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a protective case made of microfibers or an intra-earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction lenses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Already five years ago my father wiped himself out of the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him now,
I was so afraid of forgetting it or rather I didn’t know how I was going to continue to “frequently” it.
There is no recipe, no manual to pass through the wall of the invisible and find his.
Then signs appeared.
For the first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch that no longer leaves me, laid on the bedside table.
It is the image of my smiling dad that accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found his body empty, scratched on this hospital bed with frozen sheets.
Similarly, his funerals were a glacial farewell focused around the lean light of the candles that would frame his box.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, by small day or night appearances, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she regained her place in the landscape of my thought which was believed to be mourning.
And then she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not at all lost the person of my mother but simply a woman I didn’t really know, a woman who embodied that person, during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and complete.
This deviation from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It’s a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside and out," he said.
I've always been told.
I never believed him at the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I quit smoking, when I was afraid, when I was sick...
He spoke to me, constantly encouraged me, he lived my body.
I saw her hands looking at mine, I lent her my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me with my privacy.
It took a long time, then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don’t know who said that dead people are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I always feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it’s too late, only, there’s always one thing that keeps me from accomplishing this moment.
I often wake up anxiously when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams bring me the opposite and fit into my history and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
The eve of my ultrasound where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was waking up, getting out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor and he was smiling at me and happy that I was expecting a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to mean to me that he was happy to share what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I loved sharing this moment with him and I am happy to tell you about this common memory that lived after his death.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died from a cancer.
A year earlier, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is to say the shock that her disappearance caused in the young bachelor I was at the time.
In spite of all this, I realized my grief fairly quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I am in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested me in the Middle East, to the point of becoming a master in a large school, have not been, with the backsliding, anodin choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she instilled in me are always present, so I can think of how she would like me to act at any given moment.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to be at the height of the generosity and spirit-righteousness of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I can see his eyes poking at me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
He died after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that triggers alone, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then the weather calmed the pain.
The only thing left is the lack, this unanswered void, the need for her, to trust me, to reassure me in the hollow of her tenderness.
Still, she’s here, silent presence, she’s here and looking at me.
Every morning, I see her anxious eyes pose on me, I see the nuts that aggravate her gaze, the ridges around her lips that dig cigarettes, the folds that mark the front on the days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looked at me in my mirror every morning.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We are constantly feeling his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his pain bed, so we gradually learned to smile, and to pronounce his name is no longer a taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the middle of the night when absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when morale is a little bit reached.
We feel carried and protected in difficult moments, the delay in time makes us realize how much she was an orchestra leader and we try to stay on the path she had traced us.
If a being has loved you very much, the absence cannot take you away from the heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 due to asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I couldn’t attend his funeral and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I sometimes have my beliefs different from his, I always wonder if my actions are consistent with his vision of things.
I have also had problems with my work for these beliefs.
For me, it’s impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don’t sleep in it and I always wonder what he’ll think of it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he's here on a daily basis.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It was soon thirty years ago that my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son 6 years old.
The immense punishment that invaded me at that time, of course, has eased, but it is still close to me.
Very often he "descends" in my dreams in such a precise, so vivid way that when I wake up I am even more sad to see that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going well, I told him no, he answered me "I'm going down" but with such a real voice that I woke up in surprise, anxious and I turned on the headlights looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to happen.
I always live in the same house, and often, I feel watched and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we have been happy and or his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since he left, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October has been the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the U.S. President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
“We don’t tell the world to be by our side and to support ourselves, we have the right to ask the world for it because we are part of it,” Al-Maliki told Washington on Thursday.
And also because if what is going on in Iraq is not settled, it will expand, and what is going on in Syria will expand as well.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the U.S. Institute for Peace, an independent institution established by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They brandished banners accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with assistance.
Cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation has been imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to the Lord of the Crime Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed on the big day.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Court of Appeals
A large defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would not be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to the crime boss Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug-related activities after he compromised because of his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed “Bash” and considered by criminals to be a “first-aid file,” was arrested at his home in 2011 following police hearings headed to Scarborough, which he represented in a previous trial related to smuggling.
Police have spotted Sarborough, 32, laying three bags of cocaine at the lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a Barreau dinner with his siblings.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought to illegally obtain information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.
The four suspects were monitored by police at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking taking place in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after police seized heroin and cocaine for <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, as well as more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction would be revealed on the big day.
Today, at Liverpool Court of Appeals, Ditta, who works at Blackburn’s Forbes Solicitors Law Firm, fell into disrepair after being convicted of two chiefs of prosecution after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine at a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall came after police, investigating Scarborough, found out that he had been in regular contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta’s home and placing the drug, which is 60% pure, under the lawyer’s garbage in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly contacted by telephone with Ditta who was at a dinner at the football stadium in Ewood Park, the Blackburn Rovers club's pregnancies.
The lawyer returned to his home, discovered the drug, and they called each other nine times.
The court heard Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but refused to consume cocaine. He said he had spoken to the suspected drug dealer because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During her arrest, Ditta picked up her wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from her.
During an interrogation, he stated that he owned an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that he was occasionally called by clients at his home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that he was calling for major actors in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “If someone needs to know that there is no violation of the law, he’s a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because it was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He hindered the police investigation as much as he could to enable him to pursue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonoured her.
He got too close to some clients, especially Scarborough, and he let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal action and stated, “If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited for 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said, "Mr. Ditta has gone from criminal lawyer to criminal lawyer himself since he started getting drugs from criminal organizations."
His addiction to cocaine has compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the back-thoughts of the leaders of organized criminal groups who have entrusted him with valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted an inquiry into Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of the three chiefs of cocaine possession charges and is now being prosecuted, as evidence of his commitment to prosecuting criminals.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and translate you to the courts.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question/answer session on himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the corridor of death in America, his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be back on stage in December.
The Detroit News newspaper reports that the Queen of the Soul will take place on December 21 at the Sound Board Hall of the MotorCity Casino hotel.
In November, Franklin recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she was suffering from, Respekt’s famous interpreter told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were “difficult”.
She said she was “happy to be back.”
Menton reduces the cost of Christmas lighting
420 patterns, 2.2 kilometres of seaside covered with a coat of light: one could roll the hot blow in Menton with the illumination bill.
Invoice which, unlike many municipalities, is also settled by taxpayers, not by trade associations.
To alleviate its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the public lighting and Christmas decorations network.
Los Angeles Airport Evacuated After Shooting
A shooting took place at the Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to local police, at least two people were injured.
It would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the firefighter.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a panic wave.
Passengers and staff rushed to the exits or on the tramway.
Very soon police forces intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was arrested on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had had a lot of success during the previous season.
Through five synets designed and interpreted by artists in the region, with a high dose of humor, teenagers are allowed to enjoy classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Society of Lyrical Art of the Kingdom will return with its Lyrical Destinations, a formula that now makes room for the Chicoutimi Pulp.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists from the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
In addition to these activities, the lyrical Apéro, the concert-benefit held last August, with the competition of the soprano coloration Marie-<0xC3><0x88>ve Munger.
It was a non-profit activity, parallel to the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization to produce a financial balance sheet that is as sweet to the ears as a mouse squirrel.
Without delivering accurate figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of yesterday’s press conference in Chicoutimi, to prove reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future draws well, even in the long run.
We have more solid and constant support.
"Finances are floating and we hope to last until the opera's 50th anniversary, a step we'll go through in seven years," he said.
"I would say even beyond," added the CEO, Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child as a hostage at Gabrielle Roy school in Surrey faces six chiefs of charges, according to the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been accused of taking hostage, kidnapping, threatening, carrying a weapon in a dangerous design, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to deter the situation immediately have been essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," Colonel Bert Paquet said in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New request for collective remedies against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new request for collective remedies was filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that would have taken place this time at the Saint-Joseph oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the applicant's testimony, identified as "J.J.", which was supposed to have been masturbated in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, Brother Soumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, as his father-in-law, at the oratory of St. Joseph.
The first appeal was aimed at only three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people said to us, "I, I was in such a place, can I register?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both cases.
The collective remedies that have just been filed has the particularity of allowing the addition of complainants from any establishment where abuse could have been committed by members of the Congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also underlines that the Congregation of Sainte-Croix and the Oratorium of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuses to be committed against children", that they "have borne" and "exercised" a "moral, religious and sexual constraint" to the sects and psychologists.
The latter allegations are based, among other things, on letters written by the Sainte-Croix brothers’ lawyer, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on research in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, an ex-brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced sevices.
Collective action must first pass the stage of admissibility in the High Court.
Once the admissibility has been admitted by the Court, the second stage, or hearings, is carried out.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were conducted on the ground.
Significant fire in a trade
A fire severely damaged a trade in the LaSalle district, in Montreal, on the night of Thursday to Friday.
Emergencies were called around 1 a.m. on Friday due to a fire that occurred at the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
Thirty firefighters who were fired at the scene took nearly an hour to master the brassier.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," the head of operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux, said.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one in the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no wounded, but nearly twenty homes, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments may need to be accommodated temporarily, the SIM said.
Many Opposition to Medical Aid to Die in Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical aid to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to soothe their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few would want to end their days, according to a spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus was placed on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would be minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical care to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she lamented.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to Suzanne Fitzback, vice president of the Alliance of palliative care homes.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be unnecessary anyway.
We are never asked, “I want to die, give me an injection.”
The director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that Quebec’s bill disorients the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario will take the step.
For her part, the Liberal deputy from Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, claims that the notion of end of life must be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan Press Disapproves of Controversial Media Law
“This is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask yourself the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?” the newspaper said, contesting the bill and demanding that it be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it,” explained Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent news radio stations and websites in Kenya.
He said the new media court "will always be partial because it is a prolongation of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to parliamentarians," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have “hands on the media.” The Standard, in turn, indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya “had undergone a hard blow” and stifled the bill calling it “draconian”.
The bill is being passed at the same time as a train of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists at the Westgate mall last September.
Kenyan media sparked anger from authorities by broadcasting footage of video surveillance cameras on which troops deployed on the scene of the attack robbed the so-called luxury shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to question them, although the call was withdrawn following a shield lift in the media.
Under the new bill, media may be liable to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being “radiated” or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations.”
He also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “animated blogosphere.”
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist for The Nation, wrote, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
“Delivered to themselves, politicians would put the country in bankruptcy and take us back to hunting and picking.”
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of the anger of the population in the past.
In May, they took a position against the cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission and restored their admirable salaries of about 532,000 shillings per month tax-exempt – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists from the Laval Centre for Health and Social Services (CSSS) caused a lot of excitement to the management of the Cité-de-la-Santé Hospital, during the year 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirement departures, maternity leave or short departures, the department of pharmacy has found itself very deficient in personnel.
Almost 30% of the necessary staff was missing, making this financial year “very difficult,” according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to engage independent labor, which can cost up to three times more than a full-time pharmacist.
There was no recourse to the troubleshooting, Mrs. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities within the facility have been streamlined or decreased for camping, as long as things are replaced.
It is certain that we have worked hard to get our young [pharmacy residents] to come and stay here.
There's a circumstance contest that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is much easier for the CSSS Department of Pharmacy.
Already, three pharmacists are returning to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in the past months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain have been fruitful, as the four students currently residing in Laval have also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
“It’s much better now,” the pharmacist said.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will fill our outings from last year.
ever-increasing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or the prevalence of young women in the profession, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancy, we almost always run to three maternity leave when it’s okay.
Last year, we had a lot more and we didn’t have pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model does not start his career in cinema by the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to portray young Charlotte Gainsbourg in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will be released in two volumes (January 1 and 8, 2014), erotic memories of a four-year-old sex addict since her teenage years.
The resemblance of Stacy Martin with her senior is striking: a silhouette of brindle, a diaphane tint and French-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste of risk: the one that had not hesitated to put naked on ice paper will show up in much more sulfurous situations on the big screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac made the temperature rise on the Canvas: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their puddle in the closet, he resorted to professionals of the X for the most ostentatious sex scenes, before fusing all the bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has the habit of pushing her actresses into their latest breaks, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A room at the CGR of Narbonne evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, as a result of coughs in the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility prompted the evacuation of the room and warned the firefighters of a suspicious smell.
Approximately 70 people left the meeting.
The people were examined and a complete recognition of the room did not give anything.
Bad joke on the background of tear gas jet?
Or an involuntary incident?
It has always been that the management of cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers in depth.
The room was aired and everything went back to order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and the customers regain the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into lemons
Enjoying Halloween, a woman tried to get two pounds of cocaine hidden in strawberries into the country on Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the checking of the passenger's luggage that the drug could be detected.
The cocaine had been divided into three lemons that had previously been emptied.
The drug was then transported to the office of the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie (RCG), which took over in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not disclose where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, a spokeswoman for the CBSA.
What I can tell you is that it was happening in the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, a total of 1653 narcotics seizures were carried out by the Quebec region’s border services.
Air raids on military facilities in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace early in the afternoon on Wednesday, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of short-range SA-8 ground-air missiles would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new Tsahal air raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place under circumstances roughly identical to those of July 5: at the time, it was also an anonymous US official who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont ground-to-sea missiles, delivered by Russia in Damascus.
Israeli officials had not concealed their irritation at seeing Washington unveil the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Ukraine's solvency rating on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to cope with its financial obligations.
The country's public debt securities notes go to "B-", falling into the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative perspective, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be lowered again within a year.
“It is increasingly less likely that the government’s strategy will ensure enough foreign currencies to meet its high external financing needs,” the U.S. agency said.
The agency notes that Ukraine’s foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of loans made abroad.
These reserves, to which the authorities have massively used to support the local currency, hryvnia, are collapsing, the agency is increasingly likely to devalue, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, who accuses it of not paying an invoice of <0x24>882 million.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbour, angry at Kiev’s willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU in late November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had undergone its fifth quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it to 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, which has a budget deficit, has been seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for months, which in 2010 had given it a loan of <0x24>15.3 billion and has so far unlocked only <0x24>3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranche until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by raising gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "significant external financing needs" constituted a "vulnerability", while "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud, from the Centre for Political Studies, "one cannot expect an improvement in the short term".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the 2015 presidential election is scheduled, the expert said.
The only hope is an improvement of the international situation.
S&P also highlights the "uncertainty" associated with the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditioned on the release of opposition Yulia Timochenko.
“Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia’s reaction,” S&P said, fearing “trade restrictions” on the part of Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukraine's exports, warned that if a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev is created, it should strengthen its border controls on imported goods.
U.S. Green Fire at Publicis-Omnicom Merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they received no objections from US authorities to their merger, drawing closer to the creation of the world’s first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the previously announced merger review deadline of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the two groups announced in a statement.
They said they also received the necessary permits in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period foreseen by the HSR in the United States and authorization decisions issued in other jurisdictions meet several of the conditions necessary for the execution of the operation.
"The merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorizations and on the approval of the shareholders of the two groups," they add.
Congolese army chases M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were going to chase the M23 rebels into their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu, bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the verge of being beaten after being expelled from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) locations it had controlled since the insurgency began 20 months ago.
“We’re going to prosecute the M23 and hang it where it hides because it’s criminals,” Colonel Olivier Hamuli, a spokesman for the FARDC, told Reuters.
We must not allow them to be reorganized because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace back.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military coup attempts would not change his demands for peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, took over Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and the M23.
Clashes have been reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town to fall in the hands of the insurgents this week, as well as in the vicinity of Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion was born in 2012.
At their summit in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the government garrison’s escape and the passivity of the Monusco blue helmets.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the world's largest in terms of staff, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawi and Tanzanian soldiers.
For his part, the FARDC major was rebuilt and the army moved to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
“The M23 seems to be coming to an end,” a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, predicted on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historical - it would be the first time the Kinshasa government has succeeded in battling a major insurgency.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no allied armed group in Rwanda would be present in the eastern part of the DRC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, who denies it, of military support for the M23, which was formed at the outset of mutiny former Congolese military personnel.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, has invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali had mentioned the possibility of military reprisals as a result of the shells falling on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the bourgeoisie to greet the entrance of the FARDC soldiers.
“We lived for a year with M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us to be released by the military one day,” said a resident of this border town in Uganda.
“We have lived in terror (of M23), we are traumatized,” he added.
Tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have turned out to be negative, the ministry of health said.
He said that "the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date."
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of being infected after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already caused about fifty deaths.
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, reported on Friday a decline in its quarterly profit due to the decline in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining retreating from the group’s targets.
Its net profit for the third quarter fell to <0x24>4.95 billion, or <0x24>2.57 per share, compared to <0x24>5.25 billion, or <0x24>2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters estimated an average profit per share of <0x24>2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company aims to target 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a growth of 25% of production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures have increased by <0x24>7 billion in two years and are projected to reach <0x24>36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell by 45% to <0x24>380 million.
This decrease in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron’s main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported a net profit drop on Thursday, despite the rise in its gas and oil production.
School Transport: the complaint deemed admissible
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) requires from the beginning of the school year a fee of <0x24>150 per student (up to a maximum of <0x24>300 per family) for students benefiting from two-residence school transportation, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the amendments to the last budget, no financial contribution was requested.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested in," explains Ms. Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediate and requested an additional time to reflect on it.
"It is always better to talk about it, to concert and to find solutions," says Ms. Lefèvre.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organization has only meant that mediation is part of the process during a complaint.
Cheating around the closure of the Emergencies of the Hotel-Dieu
In the face of the blunder carried out over the past several months by some of the staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, the health minister, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10 to “delay the timetable for implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of emergencies that will not be able to intervene on November 4.”
An official request made "to run no risk on taking care of emergency services in Paris early in the winter" but also aimed at not hindering the PS campaign a few months from the municipalities.
Despite the ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective at this date.
Even if, in APHP, we prefer to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of November 4, firefighters who insured about a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency services at the Hôtel-Dieu will all receive orders to take the 30 serious cases per day to the emergency services of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of hospitals.
At the Hotel-Dieu, emergency departments will leave room for five general-medicine departments on Monday.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The Hotel-Dieu emergency service must be closed as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4," assures without hesitation Loïc Capron, chairman of the APHP Medical Establishment Commission (CME), who supports the management project.
“On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by the firefighters, only people coming by their own means,” confirmed Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients urgently," he said, affirming the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain on the spot, he also said.
But it is up to the ARS to decide the closure of the emergency reception service.
"Things are being done gradually," says Nicolas Péju, ARS spokesman for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
“The minister has lied to us or he has been lied to,” said emergency doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Resigned from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for having led the squad against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a "launcher of alert" in the face of a "cynic" decision taken by "the medical-administrative techno-structure".
"They're emptying and asphyxiating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he said.
“If the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem.”
But they are regularly engorged.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting at the Emergencies of Lariboisière.
In the ARS, it is claimed that thirty "dispatched" patients on several sites are not at risk of representing an "avalanche" in other emergency services, the human resources of which will also have been strengthened.
At the ARS and the APHP, the "new hospital model" is defended, which has been in place since October 7 and is expected to continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients a year.
By the end of the year, liberal generalists are also expected to be involved in the establishment of a "permanence of outpatient care."
“Where do we go if people are asked to self-diagnose,” asks Gérald Kierzek, for whom “the concept of non-serious emergency” is “dangerous” and marks a “medical regression”.
This will be the case for level 3 maternities.
People aren’t crazy, they’re going to go where there’s the best offer of care.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change bracket, warns Christophe Prudhomme, an emergency physician and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP counselor in Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the UMP in Paris was for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to the answers."
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, once again recalled on Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken in favor of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, she would mark her net disagreement, said Bruno Julliard, her spokesman.
Even though the restructuring of the Hotel-Dieu has its legitimacy in the background, we cannot admit it without an acceptable scheme of postponement to other hospitals.
Obama Stops Listening to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to end its hearings on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House’s attempt to take back the NSA hearing case following the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that the IMF and the World Bank have been monitored by the intelligence agency since the start of the scandal.
Asked about the issue, a U.S. administration official responded: “The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance targeting World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington.”
Expressing itself under the seal of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had been established in the past.
Another official, he said, had ordered Barack Obama to stop these practices in the past weeks.
This instruction was given roughly at the same time as the one ending the hearings at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission on Thursday approved a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programs, but authorised their prosecution.
The Commission has imposed new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the retention of that information.
The United Nations welcomes new targets for the fight against poverty
The United Nations is now working on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been set 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in highlighting the “Sustainable Development Goals” aimed at replacing the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit that began on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to “beyond national interests.”
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs),” he added.
These MDGs will be based on progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that are based on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as conflicts erupt between powerful figures
At the foot of the statue of Mozambique’s founding president Samora Machel, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
Worried about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a T-shirt with the mention “we want security” in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered in the capital’s Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost every day reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst engagement since the peace agreement signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by white-run Rhodesia and then the South African apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts think the country should not fall back into an open conflict, but recent events have shocked foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is significant for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than <0x24>50 billion in investments over the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, the U.S.A., the U.S.A., and the U.S.A. in Eni.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo mutually reject responsibility for the tensions.
Renamo says the government is responsible for the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked the Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo’s spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes the Renamo responsible for triggering conflicts, and accuses him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a “loser” who wanted to use “all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government.”
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist that they both want to avoid the war.
But the concern grew after Mazanga said that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the deal was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
“We want to resume the negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties failed to ease tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
“It’s two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who don’t stop arguing,” said Joseph Hanlon, an open university lecturer and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate well and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasury from the government.
The share of votes collected by the Renamo has continued to decline since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to receive more votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza — who is due to step down at the end of his second term next year — wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not known exactly what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it has carried out disruptive lightning attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the hangovers took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if the Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has heightened the frustration that the government is sparking, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and that it is up to them to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said people only wanted stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads,” he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as “lifestyle models,” the author says.
Thor’s legend could show that “brutal force does not weigh against subtle rust,” while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be “too violent, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to be taught at school,” Crossley-Holland advocated a “metic selection” of works adapted to age.
“I find it formidable that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been supporting this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “openly educated” makes children “completely declining,” with messages being “sublimated” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said, “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult writer for adults and an adult writer for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or ending well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what is shown and what is not said.
One fighter from the Hamas armed branch was killed tonight and another wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources said in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they carried out an Israeli armored gunshot.
NSA spying: U.S. ‘goes too far’, admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone “too far” in terms of espionage, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged in Washington’s first controversy with Europe over massive data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time a U.S. government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in interception by the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that it doesn't happen again in the future," John Kerry said at a conference in London he attended from Washington on Thursday 31 October via video link.
In his retransmitted speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William The Hague, the head of U.S. diplomacy has long justified intelligence and intelligence-gathering practices by the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the U.S. authorities had since launched many attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed, because we were able to be aware of these projects," the U.S. diplomat said in a statement.
And, John Kerry said to the Europeans, “I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived.”
But we are trying to gather information.
“And yes, in some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately,” the secretary of state admitted, who had already spoken about this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He said on Thursday evening that President Obama was “resolved to try to clarify and that he was conducting a review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.”
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of users from Google and Yahoo.
The paper, citing documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, claims that the program called "MUSCULAR", and conducted with the British NSA counterpart, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from the optical fibers used by Internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in the last month of January, ranging from metadata on emails, text elements, or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any link to these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA would have massively intercepted data and communications from US allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the U.S. press claimed that the U.S. president was unaware of such hearings, Barack Obama refused to speak about it, invoking national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even sent the bullet back to the European intelligence services that would have seized these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve “military operations” in countries where these NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and would not target Europe at all, General Alexander said.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network that has also sparked China’s anger.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his master's asset, Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announced the Ligue 1 club in a statement.
PSG, the leader of the championship against Monaco, unlike goals, released the list of players held for the 12th day match, without the 32-year-old.
The statement simply indicates that he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from an inflammation of the left knee when he returned to the selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated deceased
The crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased cremated in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a Socialist candidate for the Paris City Hall, is expected to attend, and will then explain her proposals for funeral at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funerals of a loved one, the opposite is true: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book Death in Ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice president of the National Committee on Funeral Ethics, insists on the "violence" that cremation constitutes for the survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a bunch of ash" in very little time, and not after a process of decomposition, which would "accompanie the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolical violence", which involves the "deletion of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is what is undoubtedly accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries still badly lived in France?
“Because cremation is a new fact,” says Marie-Frédérique Backé, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Approving Death.
It has only been tolerated by the Catholic Church since 1963, which has limited attempts to exploit it.
Approving cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director General of Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with an inhumation.
The annual survey of Ipsos shows a strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one for their loved ones, whether they are religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers want it too.
The crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
“For about a decade, they have been trying to avoid the violence of family waiting, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the return of the ashes,” says Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now offer ceremonies masters, who, in the presence of the body, proceed to the following ritual: welcoming the assembly, naming the deceased, connecting him to others, evoking him, giving meaning to his death, organizing the farewell.
This is the case at the crematorium of Father Lachaise, since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have converted.
There are also ex-Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the crematorium of Father Lachaise has been organizing, since 2010, the Day of La Toussaint, several memorial ceremonies, secular and non-religious, to which he invites the families of people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is retransmitted online, to the attention of those who could not travel.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, relocation due to rats turns to controversy
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
In the face of the urgency of the situation, the Director of the Southern Habitat Lands Office proposed, exceptionally and temporarily, to relocate the couple and their three children to a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken excessive proportions, says Jo<0xC3><0xAB>l Canapa, the director of the office.
Rats, there have always been in the cities.
The deratization company performs two passes per year, and in addition, we intervene, at our own expense, at each request of the inhabitants.
So, since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats do not pulverize in the city.
For environmental and public health reasons, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, you will not kill a puppy.
"We didn't invite the rats to our house," the family father defended, who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without the sweep and we are waiting for a new accommodation, the same price as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange ends down by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The share has suffered a dollar-to-yen decline, detrimental to export values and a warning on its annual earnings launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix dropped 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony dropped by more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house the prey of flames in Old Quebec
A fire that triggered Friday afternoon in Old Quebec was quickly mastered.
More than thirty firefighters were fired at 9 Hebert Street.
The flames were declared in a three-story house located behind the Quebec Seminary court.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, who were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw the apparent smoke.
“Then the alarms followed, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it’s buildings stuck here,” said France Loiselle, a spokeswoman for Quebec firefighters.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the audience, about the audience.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it was more recently resumed by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolinas stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and major theaters.
"Most of the poster heads have emerged in the Carolinas, and have had a great success, until they became too famous to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We have created this festival in order to continue working with them.
This year’s event will be attended by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of “Stand Up for Heroes”, a comedy and music evening for the former fighters, organized at Madison Square Garden, to which will be present, among others, Water Springsteen, and Jon Rowart Co.
The festival has grown as much as the world of comedy.
Several of this year’s festival attendees have gone through non-traditional circuits, for example, featuring shows on small television channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a cable channel (“The League” on the FXX channel’s cheerfully lascivious fantasy football theme) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the show "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the cast of the "Parks and Recreation" series, but she is still best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a singular voice (surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, ironic advocate of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting takes place at the City Hotel, in downtown Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that, when he was here, sometimes he went down a street between two buildings and he said, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come and live here."
Oil price continues to fall and approaches <0x24>96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns over the importance of stocks offset a report showing that the Chinese manufacturing sector is exploding in electricity.
The price of the U.S. crude reference for delivery in December dropped from 14 cents to <0x24>96.24 the barrel in late morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% drop for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show a growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth boomed to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
The crude Brent, a reference for the international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to drop to <0x24>108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
The Right to Abortion in Texas
A federal court of appeal in Texas has restored certain restrictions on the right of voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a first instance judge this week.
This judgment means that a text of law adopted in July in that State and largely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The Court of Appeal ruling means that doctors who practice IVGs will have to have a "privileged admission" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, under his or her status as a nursing member of a hospital, to admission a patient to a hospital or medical center in order to issue a diagnosis or treatment there.
Advocates of the IVG argue that the contents of the law may result in the immediate closure of one-third of the state’s clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this “admission privilege” for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a court of first instance had ruled on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But Texas Attorney General, Republican Greg Abbott, who disputed the post of governor, asked the court of appeal to cancel the first-instance ruling that blocked law enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for the month of January.
The New Star has managed a return in force, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% of the audience.
But was the show on the appointment?
Approximately 10,000 candidates have come to this 10th season to face the jury: Maurane, the evil Sinclair, the perch André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored at this first prize.
As every year, the first audition shows feature a wide selection of grass singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Now, on Twitter, you want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some of them found their account.
They are many to have tried the New Star, and sometimes even to go to the end.
Behind the television screens, successful singer vocations are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make you laugh.
Court blocks decision on NYPD’s monitoring and scrutiny policy
A federal court of appeal on Thursday blocked a judge's decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department's monitoring and scrutiny program and dismissed it from the file.
The U.S. Court of Appeal (Second Circuit) indicated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the city's appeal concluded.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to control and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed for its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign an inspector to assist the police department in amending its policy and the training program associated with it.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the suspension request on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be dismissed from the file because it violated the Code of Conduct of Judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of partiality, partly because of a series of interviews given to the media and public statements in which she coagies
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black men of Hispanic descent as part of their monitoring and excavation program.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee changes, including policy reform, training and oversight, and has ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test the body-bearing cameras in the areas where the largest number of controls are taking place.
In August, New York City agreed to put an end to the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after a police check.
The hearing of the appeal by the city is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of monitoring and excavation have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and excavation system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of checks recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest record level in 2011 with 684,330 checks mainly involving black men of Hispanic origin.
A judicial action was initiated in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into a collective action.
Proponents of changes in the NYPD’s monitoring and monitoring program say they will put an end to unfair practices, allow for more effective and trusted police forces, and be able to change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say these changes would undermine police morale without lowering crime, would represent a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of pressured police forces after police personnel have been severely reduced over the past decade.
The judge stressed that it was not ending the constitutional control and excavation practices, but that it was reforming the way the NYPD was implementing its controls.
The tenants must go to vote, as each of them pays an average of <0x24>100 per month on the price of the property that goes tax to the City.
When the owner pays <0x24>5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each accommodation.
We are obliged to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
By going to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us they were going to attack the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay for fireworks at <0x24>100,000, lands of <0x24>4 to <0x24>5 million in case...
Go to vote, it's the best way to express yourself and say it's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entering the 500 m2 of the Elisean kitchens as committed after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the stairs to become a chef nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation spots, and fed an incalculable number of the greats of this world in a quasi-anonymous that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement 60.
The open-faced man, skull disguised and intellectual glasses, born on 24 October 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin is the owner of a pastry CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I have passed from one castle to another!" ironically Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the mania of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
“It’s always the head of state or his wife or wife who chooses the menus,” he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she was coming directly into the kitchen," to the point that she had forbidden women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
It does not matter to heads of state who showed a relative indifference to terrestrial foods, "they are all gourmet," Bernard Vaussion kindly denounces.
Jacques Chirac certainly had “a slightly more developed appetite.”
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the dishes were empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, “is someone who likes to eat” and “there’s not much he doesn’t like.”
The current head of state, who recovered the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no request for a specific diet".
Bernard Vaussion also recalls the pressure that was on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners at the Elysée: “between 200 and 250 people in about an hour.”
The night before is almost white.
Those people wouldn’t understand that there are mistakes.
The former chef of the Elysée, who had a drink on Tuesday night with his team, family and friends, leaves with a pinch of heart.
He said compliments.
“The human side has emerged,” he said.
The chief will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been in the Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in Old Quebec on Friday afternoon.
The four-bedroom building, located at 15 Hebert Street, was the subject of three alarms from the fire department.
The fire was declared on the front, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, a spokesman for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this sector of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The fire house was housed in four houses, but no tenants were on the spot at the time of the fire.
Damage has been limited, even if the water has caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the scammers have turned the thesis away from a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: Release of the Second Trailer
Martin Scorsese evades a few images of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New Yorker broker, is incarnated by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will decoy you in his role as a decent trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a “Long Island Stock Exchange broker who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a massive Wall Street corruption case.”
In the 80s, Jordan Belfort then mounts a scam that will make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow its incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, man is chained to parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess in all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese has been delayed due to its too long mounting.
It looks like the film lasts at 2:45.
In the room on December 25, he will be able to participate fairly in the Oscars.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipeline
Former News of the World editor-in-chief Andy Coulson reportedly used “phone piracy, surveillance and confrontation” to attempt to confirm a bidon pipeline on a link involving then-exercising Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said in the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her “cute special advisor.”
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, with hacking Pawlby’s voice box and “planting constantly in front of his door,” but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
"The accusation suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people's house hoping to surprise them, it's the kind of man to like to present the story to people to see what they have to say."
He said that NotW was using three ways to investigate the subjects: phone piracy, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, he cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Is he aware of phone piracy?
He says the opposite, but we say “Of course yes.”
Rumors about a link involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW editorial office when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said she had been told, “Don’t waste your time with her, she’s with Charles.”
A tape, on which voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at the home of Mulcaire in August 2006.
Investigators also found intrusions on the private detective's computer that involved Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the period when the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
In the meantime, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw Ms. Pawlby's minor facts and gestures.
In a voice message he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, “I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow that I really want to tell Charles.”
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself attended co-defender Rebecca Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to piracy.
Barack Obama Receives Iraqi Prime Minister In Full of Violence
The U.S. president was expected to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, seeking help from the United States to fight the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq had its deadliest month in five and a half years in October, according to figures released on Friday, November 1, by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people were killed in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations estimates 979 deaths and 1,902 wounded.
These violence are increasingly deadly despite enhanced security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shia-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
Two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence scares off a new hug as neighboring Syria is on the verge of a civil war.
The bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot down in the middle of the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing dissatisfaction of the Sunni minority in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and being the target of unfair arrests, has favored this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, more violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the deaths of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been blamed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a “world war” against al-Qaeda.
Violence is at the heart of U.S. Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki’s talks to be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the American president, elected on the promise of ending military engagement in this country, had drawn an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and Congressional elected.
On Thursday, he advocated for the international community to wage a “third world war” against al-Qaeda.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican senators and Democrats.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, attributing to him the partial responsibility for the resumption of the violence by his "sectarian and authoritarian policies".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that “Iran’s pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.”
Beijing accuses Uighur group of Tiananmen attack
The Chinese interior security chief on Friday accused a group of Uighur separatists from Xinjiang of being behind the car bombing that killed five people on Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, blurted over the crowd on the famous Chinese capital square, a symbol of the murderous repression in 1989, and fired killing its three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of Homeland Security, accused the Islamic Movement of Eastern Turkestan of being the instigator of the attack.
Many Ouïghours, a Turkish-speaking minority located in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province Eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence that occur due to independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing has been organized and prevented," Meng told Hong Kong's Phoenix TV channel.
"The group behind the scenes was the Islamic movement in eastern Turkestan," he added, taking his remarks by the Chinese news agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests it is of Uighur origin and said that his wife and mother were in the car with him.
The latter also contained fuel-filled containers and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident resulted in 42 injuries.
The Islamic movement in eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican probes on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major worldwide survey on how parishes manage sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage ties.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national bishops’ conference, with the mandate to get as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent U.S. Catholic newspaper.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide the appropriate way to probe the parishioners.
In the UK, bishops published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
RDC: Army attacks last fief of rebels
The irreducible M23, or a few hundred fighters, was cut to about 2,000 metres above the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two towns about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," a Jomba resident, telephoned at about 12:30 a.m., told AFP, according to which a girl was wounded by a bullet in the morning.
“The intensity of the clashes has decreased a bit,” he added, “it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed the rebels a bit backwards.”
According to the witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "overnighted" in Jomba before heading to the front for a "racking operation".
He was heard very clearly behind him with cravings fed with light weapons.
From Bunagana, the political fief and last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilisation of the DRC, the fighting has entered "a final phase" as the FARDCs "locked the residual M23 positions to delocate them".
Since Friday's resumption of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, Monusco has not participated directly in the fighting, but has provided government troops with decisive intelligence, observation and planning support.
At the end of the afternoon, dozens of soldiers, well-stocked with ammunition, were mounting in the direction of the front line.
They were armed with Kalachnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road to Bunagana, bordering Uganda, civilian-assisted military personnel loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a new FARDC flammable truck, ensuring the lifting of another engine that sparked M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila called on rebels once again on Wednesday evening to “demobilize voluntarily” under the pretext of being disarmed “by force”, but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing without results since December.
On the spot, M23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, it's only Ugandan mediation to arrange the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed by the government.
The M23 was born from a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace deal.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which they refute in Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in the DRC, and its basement is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had fled between Monday and Wednesday, according to the UN, the early-morning DRC return movement reversed at noon.
"This morning we crossed over to go to our fields, but the military told us to retreat," Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including a baby on her back, told AFP.
It feels like the shootings are getting closer to the population.
Early in the evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The Musical Comedy, This Beast of the Scene
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the sung and danced productions take their flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It’s a revolution: the musical in French is said to be a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart’s rock opera, most attempts were in the ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or The Miserables carried the aurora of the mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador has changed the world.
Nowadays, these two scenes handle the titles as successful tubes.
The first, this Christmas, takes its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the next the world creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "The Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the season's successes.
On other stages, musical performances such as "1789", "Bastille lovers" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" put themselves at the forefront of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Historys of musical comedies" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard won.
How do French musical comedies evolve?
The supply has demultiplied.
First of all, there are the "musical shows" that evolve at the pace of producers...
Some use beautiful image projections and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a 15-year bond back on the pretext that you can serve almost anything when you have Matt Pokora at the top of the poster.
Afterwards, we get the musical comedies with the sumptuous productions of Châtelet that bring us back to the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to break through.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Kiss of the Spider-Man" or "The Awakening of Spring" are hard to fund.
Do we have enough talented artists like Broadway to sing, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it’s a big year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of musical comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theaters, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The level of talent is as high as the number of jobs to be provided.
Why are the tours in the province so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays leave on tour and it is often the boulevard theater for adults and not young adults.
Musical performances fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love television and what it produces as ephemeral stars.
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of a touch of these young girls and often of their whole family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are wisely held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a provincial Zenith.
Mayonnaise is grown in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major rooms in France in the same form as in Paris.
Seriously injured in accident with a ghost driver on the ring of Brussels
A road accident caused a serious injury on Friday morning around 5:30 a.m. on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is innocuous to her.
The ring was closed to traffic, until 9:00, at the location of the accident, the time the road is loosened and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation hardly caused bottlenecks as the accident took place at the Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could therefore be diverted by this outlet/inlet of the ring.
A child seriously injured in attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old boy was seriously injured following an accident at an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer committed, but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It was closed to new order.
RDC: Army is preparing a new assault
Children play on a carbonized armor that belonged to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing Friday for a new assault on the last M23 rebel bastions near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The aim is to delocate the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks the hill of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by itself.
There will be no more than the hill of Runyonyi.
“Chanzu’s is not very strategic,” North Kivu governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fief and last stronghold of the rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed by the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred unreduced M23s have been cut to almost 2,000 meters above the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who reported fighting every Thursday throughout the day said the situation was "quiet since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting the night before and were buried.
A girl was wounded by a bullet, and three other people were injured, including one severely evacuated by the FARDC, the witness added.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on October 25, the two belligerents have given no balance of human life losses.
NSA Reveals Increasing Business Paranoia About State Surveillance
On a beautiful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew over at low altitude the British Consulate of Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
On order of the Federal Bureau for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American Post Office, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explained that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. intelligence services, once again insisted in September that the U.S. does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or improve them.”
But since Edward Snowden, the complaining consultant, began to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to trust the director on word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spyed on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever sparked corporate paranoia over overseas.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that caused the vessel to overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data be used in their mutual interest.
“Germany has to wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, who represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the U.S. is as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by EY’s advisory firm.
However, in all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, nothing indicates to date that the U.S. has passed on industrial secrets of foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe that it should endeavour to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and reopen them slowly.
“This is not the right way to do it,” says Hasso Plattner, president of German company software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn’t have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
All but the IT industry.
However, the scale and sophistication of U.S. espionage agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations have been a shock to some companies who until then thought that China posed the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data stored in the United States is governed by the laws of this jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a business organization, about 10 percent of non-US members abandoned their plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after disclosures about the U.S. Prism data exploration program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: “Our customers are asking us today a question they didn’t ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you guarantee me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is no surprise that there is economic espionage.
There's always been one.
“This is a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed as part of the current discussion,” said Kurt Bock, CEO of the chemicals producer BASF.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest of defending our businesses.
Business executives are generally less inclined to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, in case this would leave an advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long haunted the message that it is at least reckless to retrieve a free USB key at a professional salon or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says that collecting mobile phones before board meetings, so that they can’t be used as remote hearing aids, has been a common practice for years.
Germany’s BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during their trips abroad due to the risk of violating the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unauthorized access,” the BfV said in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) conducted by the United States in February cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty to second-degree hacking of economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former Director of French Internal Intelligence, DCRI, said in an interview this month: “Services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies.”
Parents of a Georgian teenager, who has died under unusual circumstances, think their son has been murdered
The parents of a Georgian teenager, whose body was found in a wrestling carpet rolled into his high school gym, think their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 trapped in a rug standing behind the backs of his high school gym.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson had died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old's family contested these findings.
“They are absolutely sure that their son was murdered,” said Benjamin Crump, attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead, as indicated in the Sheriff's conclusions.
“They think it challenges all logic, the laws of physics and common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a notebook and they returned it in a mortar bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'm going to follow the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated Johnson had died of “positional asphyxia.”
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“A number of questions still deserve an answer or a confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he is updating elements of nature to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office representative was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia ordered authorities on Wednesday to hand over all video surveillance records that investigators had examined.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the video footage would contain clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on allergies in children to schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage children’s food allergies at school.
This is the first series of guidelines published by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of child food allergies in the faculty and staff, and how to treat them in case of allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools have a stockpile of epinephrine – the EpiPen self-injector brand being the most commonly used – in order to be able to react quickly in case of potentially deadly anaphylaxis.
Legislative assemblies of states have recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have more easily epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, “I feel like something is stinging my tongue,” “I feel like I have a hair on the tongue,” or “I have stings on the tongue.”
The NSA case underscores total lack of debate on intelligence
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand sneaks into the public by summoning the U.S. Ambassador on October 21, and on the other hand prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of rumors of the presence on board Swardenow
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius calls the U.S. Ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of U.S. surveillance on all communications in France.
Isn’t it surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence on the one hand and the NSA’s condemnation of the Quai d’Orsay hearings on the other?
Wouldn't it be like a wave of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks raises the veil on the analysis by U.S. diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we consider that, in terms of U.S. power, this is an important illumination.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means an insult to this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from the information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of U.S. cooperation?
The establishment for over a decade of very powerful interception technology tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, France and the United States, in particular, have put in place almost daily cooperation and information exchange procedures, which are described on the one hand and on the other as essential.
As an example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data about the Sahel region to American services, and, in contrast - it has already been quickly said - Americans can give French information about other regions of the world.
So the underlying issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to have interception tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, especially in parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and, in the end, the issue of free attacks.
What does the United States really risk? a degradation of its image?
It's nice to report them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk posed by Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case for Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economical for him: more and more European or South American companies are retracting, in light of revelations, to entrusting their confidential data to U.S. providers subject to U.S. laws, and thus to the NSA’s endeavor.
Last element: The vast movement of revelations committed by the media around the world, which helps to spark a debate on intelligence surveillance practices so far almost non-existent, could prompt lawmakers, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose “indetermined sex”
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be rigidly attributed to their birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare their child's sex, allowing them to register a "indetermined" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make early decisions about sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex persons.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I'll keep the patchwork that the doctors created, hurt and stabbed.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, intersexuality being part of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorders, a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes or gonades (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most U.S. specialists say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to assign it, then wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical case.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist and sexual identification specialist, said the new German law “seems to be a good idea.”
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children,” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how the identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It’s like the mystery that surrounds gay people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transgender or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both simultaneously and is not clearly defined as one.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characters, (such as muscle mass, pilosity, chest and stature), primary sexual characters (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs), or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in employment, as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young, non-conforming boys now have camps specially designed for them.
Australia and Nepal already authorize adults to register male, female or “third sex” on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman named Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to be declared "neutral" after winning her appeals trial that allowed her to keep sex "unspecified" for life.
German passports will include a third designation alongside M or F-X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from this land-based Catholic country signed a petition for the “gender theory” to be removed from school books.
The American website Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that “as the world is drawn into a new kingdom where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are overthrown.”
In Maryland, the mother of a baby also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer sex to be attributed to babies at their birth.
“The role of a parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s sex,” she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, after the name of the magnificent Greek god who had double sex.
And just over a decade ago, the medical community considered the genre as a spider, which can be erased and on which one can be redesigned.
But now, many are those who question the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be mistaken, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignment as he grows up.
“In the middle of the twentieth century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered gender to be malleable.
He dedicated the term “sexual identity” and argued that social and environmental signals – how parents educate a child – interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan", his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a barked circumcision to make him castr completely, also removing his testicles, and raising him like a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that was not the case,” Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “always repeat this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex-change operations said “[They’re] not satisfied with the result.”
This is the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors couldn’t really say if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical ablation of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was forced to take female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn’t happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he underwent vaginal surgery.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he found was horrifying to him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a testosterone treatment and got his breasts removed.
Surgery made her sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called the Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director-general of California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law "invites labelling and stigmatization".
“Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child a ‘indetermined’ sex,” she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to attribute a male or female sex, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law was going to give, so we can only advance assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported Australian law because “it allows adults to choose to be recognized as third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal gender,” she added.
The German law concerns the assignment of sex to birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead to that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a mammography radiologist in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is suffering from a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said German law would "responsibly" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, at the age of 29, Katie is married and an intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or mothers.
“The law leaves some latitude to parents so they don’t have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
This allows them time to do certain tests and understand them, and a time limit before signing “male” or “female”.
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy being a parent.
You don’t have to rush for a surgical procedure that is irreversible.
“This puts children at the heart of the decision and mitigates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing what is right,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he/she feels most comfortable with – and that’s something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of her government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes that his government will hold until 2015 despite strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition as the Senate vote approaches to remove Silvio Berlusconi from office.
In an interview with the La Stampa newspaper, the centre-left leader said he "closedly intends" to continue governing with his coalition until the upcoming 2015 legislative elections.
The Italian parliament’s upper house will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former president of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support from the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his resignation.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Liberty (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on 2 October last year by his refusal to surrender to the injunctions of Berlusconi who already wanted to overthrow the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent from the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the shooting exchange.
Firefighters called at the scene said they had responded to a call stating "multiple wounded".
"The police are on site," the airport said on its Twitter account, while TV images showed people evacuated from ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) told AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a cardboard, and a second carried on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 local time (12:30 in Montreal) at airport terminal 3, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times notes that Terminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesman was unable to confirm immediately whether one of its employees was injured.
All flights at the arrival and departure of the airport have been suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza Strip
Israeli tank fire on Thursday killed a Palestinian Islamist Hamas militant and seriously wounded another in the southern Gaza Strip, health services sources said.
A Hamas source explained that fighting broke out in the region, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your shots of Palestinian mortars.
The Israeli army has just evoked a “targeted action” in the area near a tunnel called “terrorist” by the Jewish state, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama’s Campaign Considered to Leaving Biden Down for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers to President Barack Obama have, in the biggest secret, considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most remarkable event that appears in the highly anticipated book of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s 2012 campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times got a copy of the book to be published and told Thursday evening that the president’s close collaborators had conducted “in-depth group work and polls at the end of 2011” to see if Biden’s eviction could help Obama with his re-election as his hopes eased.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the top leaders of the countryside and the White House, namely former White House secretary-general Bill Daley, to measure the effect of the replacement of the vice-president by the former secretary-general.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been harrowingly kept within the Chicago Campaign QG and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president – including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew the change was under study.
“Double Down” says Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their “close personal ties,” before ultimately deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list “did not significantly improve Obama’s chances of success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we were saying, “Lord, what can we do?”
While Daley called the review a “concert,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would be beneficial during the election.
“Campaigns don’t spend a lot of money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously plan to take action,” Martin told AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was considering the replacement.
Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss was aware of the possible remanufacturing.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president “was aware” of the possible change, the former secretary-general admitted it was “possible” that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not respond definitively to the question of whether political polls had arrived at Obama’s office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden’s expulsion from the presidential list was being examined.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Do you want a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world’s first meduses-based fluorescent ice.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent collage.
He got the idea after reading a study on medusas and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that as the ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," said, "It's something incredible but we're only at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 grams of this thing costs about <0xC2><0xA3>200."
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to glow.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice I’ve ever created because the luminosity of the medusas is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But she's got a pretty good taste!
Charlie's experimental approach company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice cream fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added, “I really want to develop an invisible ice.”
This is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of medusas synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed dies during a tai chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while exercising tai chi, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed on Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died Sunday morning, while watching the trees and performing the famous 21st Tai Chi movement, with his hands of musicians shattering the air," Anderson wrote.
Lou Reed was a master of tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explained that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the last few years.
And even if we are citizens, it is our spiritual home.
“Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living that he had,” she added.
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: In Figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I've become more clumsy.
In the last two years, I haven’t distributed a single candy and I won’t do it again this year.
But the statistics show that I'm the gallant sheep when you talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of <0x24>6.9 billion in candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween party is the trends.
The disguise is expected to represent <0x24>1.2 billion out of the <0x24>6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are angry.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers, and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet the men in the space of Daft Punk will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought after outfits are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with being traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they weren’t the only ones.
In fact, Americans are going to spend <0x24>330 million in animal clothing this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of curious dogs dressed in hotdogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don't gland up.
Americans will spend <0x24>1.9 billion in candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, Sucettes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go to the candy hunt in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we’re going to buy and, not telling stories, consume 41 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don’t want to eat, and yet almost 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion grains of corn.
It is a mystery that I have not yet come to elucidate.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the U.S., which generate about <0x24>500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and this includes these great photos of you pissing on you that your friends are putting on Facebook and you can’t take off and on which a guy likes you likes it.
Finally, let’s talk about lemons.
Charlie Brown introduced us to Big Lemon when we were kids, and sculpting a lantern-shaped lemon is like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve been doing since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the “baby lemon trend” only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculpted these slippers and didn’t have to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about <0x24>106 million on lemons, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The lanterned lemons that float gently on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million lemons were grown this year.

Royal Bank of Scotland will internally create a "bad bank" structure of 38 billion pounds (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure aimed at relaxing its relations with London and accelerating its reprivacy.
The bank wants to reduce the share of doubtful assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% over the next two years and hopes to have completely cleared it within three years.
RBS also said it would enter an additional <0xC2><0xA3>4.5 billion in quarterly provision for depreciation of doubtful claims, a writing related to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would release 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thereby reinforcing its lending capacity.
The bank and London have pointed out that the "bad bank" would make a difference in the past, with the government being accused in particular of interfering in the management of RBS.
“We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and for the UK,” Ross McEwan, the new CEO, told reporters.
Land Rover Announces Sponsorship for a Series of Rallyes
The interior has 6-point harness seats and harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service that gives access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rallies fans who join Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are truly pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try out different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of the raid rally.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is going to be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornice in a career
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, escaped after a serious road accident
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in her career.
Firefighters went down the cliff to retrieve the dog and save her from a certain death
A puppy was lucky enough to escape the worst after the firefighters were called to safely retrieve him while he was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable slope of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a career on Wednesday.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and launched a call on social networking sites after she disappeared in the career following a serious accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sighted person who was walking her dog spotted Ruby on a cornice in the carriage, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton fire station crashed into the site and came down in memory to save Ruby using an animal cistern to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical Assistance Specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a precarious situation.”
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She did not move at all during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical Assistance Specialist Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very fortunate to get out of it.”
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a checkup; her overall condition was satisfactory, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said, “I was terrified to watch the rescue.”
At first I didn't think she was up there.
It was surprising to have him back in his arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were stunning.
What they did was really courageous.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely awesome.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added, “We were afraid she would fall but she didn’t move.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never drags Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a choirman on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, “He drew me when I was 18.”
She added, “It was a long time ago, and he was very kind.”
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old Jagger spokesman said he “categorically denies having made advances to Katy Perry.”
The representative added, “Maybe she’s confusing it with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed at the top of the charts this week.
Beijing calls for an Islamic Turkmen movement
"The backstory support for the attack came from the Islamic Movement of Eastern Turkestan based in Central and Western Asia," the chief of the Chinese security agencies told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on Thursday evening on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (PCC), was speaking in Tachkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has appointed a special organization after Monday’s attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same family in the Muslim-dominated region of Xinjiang, bordering several countries in Central Asia, rushed their car loaded with gasoline buckets against the entrance of the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two people and killed 40 white people.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which declares fighting for the independence of eastern Turkestan, formerly Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the UN in 2002 among Al-Qaeda-affiliated organizations.
This movement is often referred to by Chinese authorities as being responsible for sporadical disturbances in Xinjiang, but its actual influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: Europe's Explosion Gives Scots a Choice
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European area of free movement in order to join the EU.
And here we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrien's wall.
While it is true that Strathclyde’s newspaper indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the major securities (and was to be expected).
No one has said that EU Member States spend much of their time circumventing their formal rules when they are arranged.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continuous non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from the Scottish people.
This is a story that is not one of them.
And a story so ancient that it is now fictional: I first heard the bobard saying that “independence means control of passports” more than 40 years ago.
Yet one interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at a dead end.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, parties that oppose the EU or are fighting for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, collected almost five million votes in the September federal election and outlawed the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal-Democrats).
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the heavy burden on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that are experiencing excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Rather, the European system has weighed on its members the favourable exchange rates for German exporters – what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe are faced with a problem of intrinsic productivity towards Germany.
The only recourse is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper dissatisfaction with productivity in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a disproportionate disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by a cheap U.S. shale gas.
As a result, the major uprising, especially in France, is one of the major leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy in trouble.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s far-right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, bringing the socialists back to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot start from the principle that a split of the right will automatically favor the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year’s European elections to create a single anti-monetary and anti-European bloc within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties make good use of these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-monetary sentiment in Europe will unite and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more like the free Europe of Nations (sovereign) privileged by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will find their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to take its distance from this project, and I hope it will make its eyes soft on the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left alone in the Atlantic.
And Scotland, in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (mainly).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending walks to Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accept a more free European agreement on condition that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is – and it should be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Conservative Labour Party, who has co-conserved the Labour Party, Darmocir Alistair.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Aging earlier
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes don’t mean puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts Think Obesity Epidemic Could Be a Trigger for Early Puberty
The tendency towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
CNN’s former correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter’s pubic breasts and hair start growing at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution to full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as breast bulging, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, compared to 12 and three quarters in 1970.
“Once the breast has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years for the first rules to appear,” Kaplowitz, also the author of Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem, said.
Time is the most accurate test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual appearance of puberty, but it is considered “early” when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – it’s something a pediatrician can follow closely.
Faster development can justify tests performed by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging that can slow growth and small size in adulthood.
The recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and affective maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with medications but recognizes that “controlling puberty can mitigate certain behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have their rules.
“They are afraid of the risk of pregnancy or even the way they are going to handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first rules at the age of 10.
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules, it wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study on girls aged 6 to 9 years that linked the percentage of fat mass to the trigger of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on the face and in the younger pubic area, the tendency towards real early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be cautious about how we identify the true appearance of puberty,” said Dr Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will generally react well.
Girls whose puberty is early should be relieved that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
Hommage to the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the 1961 Greenwich village and folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been retrospective at the French Cinema, had flipped the Golden Palme in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Unable to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have cast their debut on the rising American film star, 33-year-old Oscar Isaac, but also on the planetary pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and the songs played live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself as a accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious retirement.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich arses in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less noisy clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the oath is due to the machine when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" is a week-long story about the hardships of a folk singer who fails to break through and gets angry with the whole earth.
He accepts to retreat the foot replacements raised in the studios.
Without housing, he tours the sofas of his friends who still want to receive it.
An Air of Documentary
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of misfortune, a guy who's not there at the right time, who's not careeristic but integral, with self-destructive behavior," Ethan Coen told the press, crowned with his brother and several O'Scares.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music fans have built their story on real personalities of the time such as folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the arrival of Greenwich village, this New York neighborhood called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk writes.
The film then takes a look at the documentary, from the 33T-invented dusty music label invaded by an unfathomable old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers were performing.
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by integrating a funny character who is constantly going through the film: a gorgeous red cat with a cracking look, Llewyn Davis’s companion of fortune.
Asked about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having "grown up in Tennessee, bathed by blues and country".
“My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play guitar,” he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is necessary to “be considered good,” “coincidence can also launch someone’s career,” and “more and more today.”
As Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to let ourselves be caught up in anything that can stop us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of SAS, is dead.
He will never know the word retirement.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at the age of 83, just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times had dedicated him as "the author of espionage novels who knew too much about it."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, theater of the 198th and 199th opus of the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically diminished by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he travelled during this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, ensured to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
“Without doubt between 120 and 150 million all countries are confused,” he said in March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment in a Foch Avenue building, two steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS have been translated.
“Without counting the pirate editions,” he added, designating a pile of books on the low table between the bronzes or the ivory reported from the 130 countries that were stranded there to locate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous chest, wearing a pistol or assault rifle.
Inside, his Serenissima Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a dishonest Austrian aristocrat and CIA contract agent to pay for the repairs of the family castle, launches himself at the stakes of all the villains of the land, Communists of the 70s and 80s, and then jihadists from the 90s.
For each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a stench of violence and torture.
“I never had the pretense of being a literary author,” Gérard de Villiers explained.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people I don’t send a message to.
He worked “like the great pre-war reporters of Albert London, who went on the spot and came back with real and long investigations.”
The father of SAS said, "Make some kind of geopolitical leaflet."
"I'm constantly on my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before I leave," Gérard de Villiers added.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including AFP, diplomats, people of the services that I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonitory: so, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command center that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way of Damascus".
In "The Fools of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in The Cairo Conspiracy, a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in Panic at Bamako, he reported the 4X4 columns of jihadists based on the Malian capital.
I have not guessed, defended Gérard de Villiers, I simply make assumptions from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 IBM marginalized writing machine "of which all the parts were changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page with a pen.
At the walls of his office are hung AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photographs of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machism by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books, but others are beautiful, intelligent, and brave women.
I’m always welcome in Africa, where I have a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers said, “Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old.”
He will not die and will not retire.
No more than me.
Aviators complain about the width of the seats while large orders are at stake
The dispute is raging among major aviation manufacturers over the width of the tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Show this month.
The conflict concerns the width of the seats offered on long-haul flights to passengers of the economy class – which are not always the most courted by airlines, but to which the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to set a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its major U.S. rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as airliners seek to sell even larger versions of their long-haul bi-engine aircraft, possibly hoping for a record order at the event that will take place from November 17 to 21.
The way in which the seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the “mini-jumbo” segment.
Boeing says its redesigned “777X” will be able to accommodate 406 people in economy class in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competitive version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is calling directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to take the lead on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
Recently, we were able to realize what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the finances of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled “Would you accept this?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus’ commercial director.
As food habits change, people get bigger, but seats on planes haven’t changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing’s 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American weight of 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average size of the 21st century American is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus claims that its rival adheres to a seat concept dating back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly named “jet set” was narrower.
Airbus added that it ordered a study that indicated that an additional inch in the seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus’ figures in terms of seat width and claims that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also said that the study shows that the experience in the cabin does not depend only on the width of the seats.
“It’s really about providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they have to do to get their business done,” said Kent Craver, Boeing’s passenger satisfaction manager.
They don’t want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race to airplane orders for an estimated <0x24>700 billion at the market price in the coming decades, enough to sway the balance of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters said for the first time in July, the seating configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between all the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a 20 per cent higher yield per seat in their latest long-haul bi-engine models than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and the original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in unit costs is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing is doing this to be able to accommodate more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Director of Confort Passager at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers vote for a more dense configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
“An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines should choose.
Airplane vendors who tour the world even take a meter with them to check for competing configurations.
While offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers a configured A350 with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus underlined the need for greater customization of cabins by offering wider seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern large aircraft, experts say it is unlikely that his appeal to the aviation industry with a view to setting a size standard for seats will result, but that it could cause the 777X sales wave to be forgotten.
Oracle Shareholders Irritated by Ellison's Salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted against the remuneration proposal for founder and CEO Larry Ellison on Thursday, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not compulsory, but it comes down to the image of Larry Ellison, the world’s third-largest fortune just aroused by his boat’s victory at the Americas Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had a negative vote on his salary.
The Oracle boss resigned from a <0x24>1.2 million bonus for fiscal 2013 closed in May due to poor performance of the group, which missed its growth targets, but received about <0x24>77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the whole declining fiscal 2013, Oracle’s net profit increased by 3.5% while the stock exchange’s bond price increased by 27.5%, surpassing the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Other tests are needed before starting human trials, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College of New York said the first signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track all nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents smokers from having their dose of nicotine.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice who were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But the mice who had not been vaccinated “were calm,” the researchers said, indicating that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections should be repeated so frequently that antibodies levels remain high that they are too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them lose their bad habits,” he added.
British scientists said the findings were interesting but reported that much more in-depth research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike on Friday in Pakistan, security services said.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in this strike, carried out in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," a senior security official said.
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, told the British government that talks had been initiated with Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripods are not influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied having changed the trade lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to see if Mr. Obeid had pressured several ministers of state to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where Obeid owns two restaurants and a cafe, after their expiry in August 2005, without any calls.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former Deputy Secretary-General, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions initiated in 2005, the government pressed for tenders to be tendered.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, auctions for Circular Quay companies, which reported to Obeid about <0x24>2.5 million a year, were renewed without a call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, admitted Mr. Tripodi, demanded a change in government leasing policy.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ministry of Ports after working under the orders of Mr. Obeid at the Ministry of Fisheries.
“The topic discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of trade leasing policy?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripod.
I don't remember what we talked about, but anyway, it wasn't that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter jets target Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official told Fox News.
The officer did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out air strikes against missile cargoes in Syria.
Foreign workers with a 457 visa may have to pass a “authenticity” test
The government is currently considering the possibility of putting in place a “authenticity” test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while considering extending repression measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion designed to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unqualified positions or as a way of getting his family and friends to Australia.
A government work document was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government’s speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“Failed statements about ‘foreigners coming back to the end of the line’ and ‘jobs for Australians first’ are an unpleasant return to the time when trade unions were demanding a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites had to be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historical artifact.
The working document outlines the 12 measures previously envisaged by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O’Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being under review.
If the “authenticity” criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to see “if the job offer is authentic in the case where the applicant is a relationship or a personal partner of the owner or person concerned within the company that sponsors it”.
Companies may also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker would die of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The 9-year-old's son, who was travelling to Australia with him, found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was transferred urgently by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study aimed at multiplying the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will begin as early as the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “would bring together the UK.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will be a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England, from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study rail capacity building and improving the duration of journeys to the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of trip durations of up to three hours between Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is to build a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are huge.
Without it, we are faced with a capacity problem of our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to support "unambiguously" Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland into the overall high-speed rail network project across the UK.
“We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British government to examine the options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edimbourg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
“I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps.”
Rules on the use of on-board electronic devices remain in force for the moment in Australia
Australian air passengers will have to continue to shut down their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the US gesture aimed at easing electronics regulations.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in “airplane” mode.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision that forces U.S. carriers to do important work in order to comply with the requirements, but have indicated that they do not immediately intend to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
“The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices on board,” she said.
This issue is the subject of a regulation that requires aircraft operators to ensure permanent security and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already spoken to CASA about her intention to extend the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said she would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a CASA review that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it is currently in compliance with the current rules.
“According to our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to immediately change that,” she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA decision and its reasons.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, hand luggage programs and instructions provided to passengers.
“As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The Group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely placed under seats or in upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: At least four injured in violent fighting
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a gang of about thirty people, according to the testimony collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a riff involving several people exploded on the side of the Post.
At least four light wounded would be regrettable.
Alerted, the gendarmes went on the spot to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore’s mortgage lenders take advantage of middle classes forced to tighten belt
Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings at a loan lender from the Bendemeer mall in Singapore to pay the school fees of her daughters.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went in,” said Amirthalinga.
Although she earns <0x24>3,000 from Singapore (<0x24>2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, became this week the third mortgage loan company to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Bet on jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – <0x24>1,300 from Singapore in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga – but it’s almost as cheap as unguaranteed bank loans.
In general, Singapore’s mortgage lenders charge an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local funder with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, mortgage lenders have the advantage of not asking for solvency checks or salary proof, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to mortgage lenders while families feel the pressure of increasing the cost of living and over-indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit powered by too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to pledged lenders to fill the gap while their economies are slowing.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor’s cited growing household debt, mainly due to the rise in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for Asian banks’ solvency.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household gross domestic product/indebtedness ratio in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, while this rate was 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which recently emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The balance sheet is that with the rise in costs, people in the middle or lower [of the wage scale] are looking to supplement their income as they can,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have made people rush to pledge their personal effects to touch the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items pledged in the city’s 200 mortgage loan stores are in gold.
People say, “The price of gold is high, let’s guarantee Grandma’s gold chain and we’ll come back to pick it up next month.”
In Thailand, the largest mortgage store operator, EasyMoney, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
The increase is such in the mortgage loan sector that ValueMax, the store operator in Bendemeer and 15 other stores like Singapore, plans to grow not only in neighboring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside Asia, says general Yeah Lee Chingce direct.
The company will finance them using 60% of the <0x24>66 million in Singapore that it raised this week during its introduction to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have wiped out criticism for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah indicates that the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also that it does not directly increase debt.
“Clients mortgage property they already own, and monetizing their personal property doesn’t increase household debt,” she says.
Betting is increasingly better socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed short-term funding.
People who go to lenders on bail are also not just those who have financial problems.
Ease people from Singapore also go to ValueMax mortgage loan stores to bet on gold lingots or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their purchase price in cash.
We see customers from all walks of life.
“It can be people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses who need cash to go through a difficult cap,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of youth pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who cared for young people in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and the office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist church in Timberlay, where the pastor was officiating, said she was deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials indicated that Mr. Hudgins had resigned.
The pastor was released on condition.
In particular, it must not communicate with people under the age of 18 and not have access to the Internet.
He will appear in the provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in a Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being chased.
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform with a bra with a gamma cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, with customers complaining to the management of the facility that called the police, the store said on Friday.
“We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store,” a spokeswoman for the Asda supermarket said.
The store called the police to rescue, but “the time it arrived, he had already left without sparkling,” she added.
I was doing the queue when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were mouth-watering.
“You don’t go out on the street that way unless you wanted to get attention,” a 60-year-old client, Rosina Rusin, told Cambridge News.
The incident occurred on Thursday, the day of Halloween, where it is customary to dress as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canular.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted pictures of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS bra twice a week at Asda for three years," Paul Dutton said, explaining that he has suffered from "mental problems."
<0x24>325 million rescue plan for Tasmania’s health system
The federal government maintains that the <0x24>325 million bailout plan for the hesitant health system is accompanied by strict conditions aimed at ensuring that the state government will not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking “urgent measures” to end a crisis caused by the aging of the island’s population, high rates of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The funding, scheduled for 4 years, was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that, in our view, will address the unique difficulties facing the state,” Plibersek said.
The <0x24>325 million plan includes a <0x24>31 million campaign for non-urgent surgeries.
2,600 additional operations, particularly in the area of orthopedic surgery and cataracts, will help to catch up on the delay.
Funds are also provided for appointmentless clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training of medical staff, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the idea that, according to leading-edge clinicians, this is the best way to cure Tasmania’s health system,” said Ms. Plibersek.
The minister said that the Tasmanian government would face a strict regime of reporting and accountability.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be formed to ensure that the State provides the services in the most efficient and efficient way possible.
Wilkie said today that the <0x24>325 million will not count for much "unless they are followed by a real reform to consolidate Tasmania's public health system."
However, he congratulated the government for responding to the urgent request for assistance that it presented to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing Tasmania’s public health system from the blacklist,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s announcement is a “solution of fortune.”
“The reason we’re here is that the Labour government has withdrawn <0x24>430 million from its health system,” he told ABC TV.
You can’t have a government that takes almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts 300 million dollars, and pretends it’s a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel boasts remarkable artistic direction and meticulous reconstruction of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in France in the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Superior Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never sinks into lubrication or sensationalism, and that’s the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a punishment for the public.
Syria has destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons, the surveillance agency says
Syria has destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the International Chemical Weapons Surveillance Agency said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are being stockpiled.
A group of Syrian militants also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the country’s civil war nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) has arrived one day ahead of the deadline for
1 November established by the organization based in The Hague ordering Damascus to destroy or "unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machinery intended to mix toxic gases and to fill the ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious schedule to destroy Damascus’s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
With the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the neurotoxic agent sarin.
The announcement was made as the fighting raged on Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
The militant group, which monitors the evolution of human balance through a network of militants based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Among them, there were an estimated 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces have been killed, including 18,678 pro-government forces fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead were also estimated 2,202 deserters and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated this figure since.
About 2 million people have fled the country because of the conflict.
Assad’s troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom have been linked to al-Qaeda network groups in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday there were losses on both sides, but gave no precision.
The fights highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by the chemical weapons inspectors as they have to complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war, within tight timeframes.
A statement by the IOC, which works closely with the United Nations, stated that its team was “now satisfied to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all declared critical production and machines for mixing and filling.”
She added that "no other inspection activities were planned for the time being."
Earlier in the week, the inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OICA said the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and ... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.”
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of two sites that OICA inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the OICA Executive Committee.
“I welcome the moral strength and courage that you all have shown in the framework of the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Ahmet Uzumcu, director general of the organization, in a comment published by the OICA.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes the Sunni Muslim rebels to the Assad government and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the sentence pronounced against one of Bali's bomb posers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted furiously to the sentence against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should be shot by an execution peloton.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the two nightclub attacks in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which resulted in the deaths of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of many other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of attacks against churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have demanded a life sentence, but they could have asked the man, who is known as “Demolition Man” for his reputation as a bomb-making expert, to be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
At the edge of the tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
“It should be pulled in front of the execution peloton,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day without having any other grandchildren, or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 23:00 on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze jumped a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he died three times while under respiratory assistance.
Mr Hugues said Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, why, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bomb posers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces will kill the former al-Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in order to restore ties between the terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
“He hasn’t gone,” added Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he had been laughing a lot at the grief he could have caused to other people.
The verdict was made on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of crying this year,” Corteen said.
Patek, however, can appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board planes (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not to speak on their mobile phone – under the highly anticipated new guidelines released by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes to be made.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from one airline to another, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the crew members' training manuals and rules on the storage of aircraft to be in compliance.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on its aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“According to the plan, we could approve a broader use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They are not supposed to light them until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their devices when the plane lands before landing and not light them up until the plane has settled.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-off, landing and grounding, FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was happy with these changes.
“Once the new policy is safely implemented – and we will work closely with carriers to do so – it will be beneficial to everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like “roomkeepers” when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be banned from connecting to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices into airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was expelled from a plane by American Airlines after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stored because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were still considered to be a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if used on board,” Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine the problem last month recommended that the government authorizes a wider use of personal electronics.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on its use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid reason for security for these bans.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or do so deliberately.
FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the time.
New airliners depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Airplanes modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems also better resist interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow a wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only issue minimum transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those pushing for a softening of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company’s leaders loaded a Kindle e-book reader liner and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee to feel mixed about whether or not the use of the devices is at risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the interference from the aircraft was real, even though the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that the devices may interfere with the systems of an aircraft, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA authorize drivers to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them common sense arrangements for tech-equipped travelers.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,” said Roger Dow, President and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
A heliported bird from a platform in the North Sea has been released into nature
A bird, helittrated after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released into the wild.
The water rim was mounted on board a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before being put back on foot by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa rescue centre.
Colin Seddon, the head of the center, said: “This waterway was probably a wintering migrator coming from northern Europe and was caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea.”
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find shelter on the oil platform.
He added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to bring our help.”
The water rod was in good health when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with the UK?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing businesses together and defining what wealth and jobs creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the broadest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representatives of all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions in the UK.
The conclusions of the investigation will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than engaging in the long and difficult process of reform of the European institutional arcs.
When asked for their opinion on specific policy points – from monopolies regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders think that control of these key skills should go back to Westminster.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, with companies saying the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey of business leaders has revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives in favour of a change in the treaty and the development of a trade-based relationship with the EU, not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a “significant change” that brings power back to the UK.
The challenges are high – to change the treaty and better represent Britain’s interests would see a 16% drop in votes in favour of the country’s retention in the EU during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate for a moment: this inquiry shows that British companies support this plan aimed at renegotiating the terms of Britain’s accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will constitute a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the UK.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is committed to a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in the UK, and, as the conclusions of our survey show, for businesses, this means re-emphasizing trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
The United States in the colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed candy to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween celebrations on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the festivals have caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the "Greenwich village" neighborhood.
Everyone is overexcited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned last year.
“We’re having fun like crazy people,” Rhonda added.
People are happy.
It's a good kid, it's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan holiday celebrated on the eve of Toussaint, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom declares that Bulgaria's gas pipeline inaugurates a new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, Gazprom’s director said.
“A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest large-scale project in Europe,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia’s export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, which transits most of Russia’s gas to Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director added.
Miller added that the direct junction with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into operation in 2015.
Gazprom said construction is expected to begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The gas pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, The News of Tahiti announced Thursday, retrieving information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This area measures 47 km2, if you count three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the Bounty mutants, an episode in the history of the English Navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutiny, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends 95% of London’s generosity.
The Council of the Island unanimously voted in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone of 836,000 km2.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask the UK to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the British governor of Pitcairn, who resides in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to ensure its surveillance, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already carry out the very costly air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesia EEA, near Pitcairn.
The FAA is softening restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on board aircraft – but it will still be banned from making calls on mobile phones.

Chinese Deputy Governor sentenced to life in prison
A former deputy governor of Jilin province in northeastern China was sentenced Friday to life imprisonment for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of hitting more than 19 million yuan of wine pots, official Chinese media reports.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, who was also the president of Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped companies and executives obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, the first intermediate court in Beijing said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, saying the phenomenon posed a threat to the Communist Party's very existence.
If the head of state has promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flyers" - the subaltern officials - only a handful of senior officials have been convicted, including former executives of the petroleum giant Petrochina.
The most recent case was the former CCP chief in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions within the state.
But the government has in no way expressed its intention to reform the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales have been charged with sexual assault against children following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
But in his opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it "never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization".
Director-General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children at the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, Commission counsel, that he had been aware of the first case but was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate, stressing that "YMCA's external checks have been carried out and indicated that the safety of children is an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second-worst ratings on four institutions during an audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and had failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of child safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's breaches of child safety.
Staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he kept them private, that he kept them on his knees, that he loved them and let them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was in charge of Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about her behavior, said she found the YMCA Caringbah Child Services Manager, Jacqui Barnat, who would be in charge of Lord “very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time.”
The Director-General said that he was rejecting the staff's testimony that they were reluctant to report these violations to their hierarchical superior.
Instead, he said that the friendly relationships they had with Lord obscured their judgment, which means they did not report his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his views before the New South Wales YMCA Board, saying that, for the organization, the lesson from “the Jonathan Lord incident” should not concern “the reporting” by staff, and the Board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to sign confidentiality agreements with staff, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by YMCA's Chief Executive Officer of Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He said that the decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was an "excess of zeal" and that it had been poorly implemented.
The YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe children's organization at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed, i.e. between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of the University of Griffith before the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and oversight of staff.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but acknowledged that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old expressed his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007, after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Special Envoy of the Quarter for the Middle East Peace Process.
When asked if he wanted to rejoin the post of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair would have responded, according to London’s Evening Standard: “Yes, of course, but it can probably happen, so...”
When many experts in equestrian demonstrations gathered in Cardiff to fight and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be rough.
But nobody expected to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old boy, win.
Not yet at school and just a few months after making his first weapons, the little boy and his pony Shetland Toffee trotted during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – which are of the same size – were greeted for presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition held at the Sunnybank equestrian center in Rudry near Cardiff.
Standing against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat hat on the side a little relaxed to make his 2-year-old Toffee pony parade around the track.
Fenton has been praised by the judges for his uncommon natural dressing qualities for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has since trained with his Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are doing an excellent duo.”
They showed up against and against everyone, but both flipped the gold cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were crazy about the joy he had won.
On the track, people who didn’t know him thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to get photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in southern Wales, follows the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in horse racing for more than 10 years.
Mrs Howells said, “There was electricity in the air and everyone was encouraging and applauding it.”
He ran the entire length of the track running and even though it seemed quite small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he cares about.
In the way he started, he will certainly soon participate in the Horse of the Year event – and I’m sure he will do a great job.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian demonstration said: “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony.”
They form a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee were well represented and the way they paraded on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud of the charm.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call “will be refurbished”
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be remanufactured, a media regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express has issued a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted pots-de-vin to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will undergo a “complete refurbishment,” the regulator said.
The order of "remanufacturing" emanated from the Guangdong administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary survey showed that New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several wrong articles on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“New Express’s writing was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided to “impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card.”
He also “ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete redesign of New Express, and recommended that he conduct an investigation of New Express’s responsible people and immediately redesign the journal’s management team.”
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express about the alleged financial irregularities of a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a first-page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing fake stories against money.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I would run after the money and celebrity.
I've realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apologies, New Express published his apologies on the first page, writing that he had not properly verified his articles.
Several major suspects have recently made televised confessions.
Experts say people are systematically forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in line.
The radioactive steam leak detected on one of Charles-de-Gaulle's two nuclear warehouses in mid-October and while the ship was at sea, was "safe for the sailors", but not without consequences for the Navy.
In fact, the Royale has just confirmed the ship's "unavailability" until "mid-November", "time to take the corrective measures to be taken" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, a specialist in the defence naval, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, deployed in the Var for the occasion, "are currently intervening on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the faulty heater.
"Everything is being implemented so that Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013," DCNS explains.
And the National Navy to certify that "it does not at all question the ship's activity program" nuclear-powered.
Please note that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier comes out of a six-month intermediate maintenance period.
He had left Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, in order to qualify young hunting pilots.
A "small breakdown", confined to the confinement area of the reactor, then occurred on the admiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a lot of dissatisfaction on the part of the people I meet: a monstrous reassessment of their properties, a swarm of taxes, the cost of permits of all kinds, administrative expenses to no avail.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dollars dilapidated could be saved in order to allow a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money taken by force from taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no problem with the sumptuous expenses and the maintenance of ducky ducks: deficit cultural center, strong subsidy to the Energy City, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, either they are sold to the private company or they are demolished.
It is also unfortunate to see the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
I give an honorable mention, however, of the transformation of the old Wabasso into some sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost for taxpayers?
It is not in the public sector to invest in such companies, but in the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that Fishing Lakes and Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the large decline in the population, water use has drastically decreased throughout the territory.
Without saying to waste it, the city will never lack water and the strict regulations on its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of more than <0x24>200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We have been run for more than 40 years by ties with beautiful degrees for the most part and I don’t think a sheep breeder gets worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railroad
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
U.S. officials have described the 4-foot-by-three tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagging at an equivalent length to nearly six football pitches long, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, United States.
The area is packed with indefinable warehouses, which makes it easy to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs emerged by passing unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They are sentenced to 10 years in prison to life imprisonment if sentenced to life in prison.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers exploit vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, thus putting a challenge for drug cartels to quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 700-yard railroad pass from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and going to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police deliver extradition warrant against Assange <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a “remission notice” against the 40-year-old Australian, asking her to appear at a police station, adding that if she did not, she would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after exhausting all possible ways under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated the appeal he filed against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, asking this South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “issued a referral notice against a 40-year-old man who asks him to appear at a police station at the date and time of his choice,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release under bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the release of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be charged with espionage, after revealing more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks site fighting secret information.
How biometrics will invade our lives
Finished the passwords to type in to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy general manager of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in a universe as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this noise for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
Only in 2011 and in France, the National Commission for Computing and Freedoms has authorised 774 fingerprint recognition systems, hand shape or hand vein network in companies, administrations, canteens...
“Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime,” Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington, D.C., said in a statement.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will be based on new technologies, which will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, hand contour and venous network of the palm or finger.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
“For example, some people who work on concrete have very bad fingerprints and their fingerprints are illegible,” says Philippe Robin, technical director of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand implies a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is both a security - one cannot capture this data unknowingly - and a drawback: sometimes the procedure has to be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out for about twenty years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
By increasing the precision of the sensors and the computational capacity of the computers required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten over the last five years, according to Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
“Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk with sound sensors, but a silent environment is needed,” said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
Unique and infalsible marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
“In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data,” confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, CNIL’s research, innovation and prospects director.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers law enforcement services a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90,000 suitcase to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and within an hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing a person among others) and authentication (ensure that the person is who he claims to be).
The identification so far concerned the issuance of identity papers: the biometric elements (prints, photo, iris) must be compared with the information the state has on all citizens already filed.
This ensures that a person does not try to overwhelm someone else’s identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store.
“We retrieve the images from surveillance cameras and compare them with the photos of celebrities that circulate freely on the Internet,” said Dany Nassif, NEC France’s commercial development officer for biometric identification solutions.
Another use: take a photo of a quidam who makes the tail in a store, track its progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (frontiers, protected premises, canteens...) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, the presence control has been added.
“A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the friend pointing for another,” explains Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But, more and more, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors by introducing its card and placing its hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the hit of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and in Angoulême by Natural Security in partnership with banks and signs of large distribution: at the time of paying in the store with his bank card, the customer does not type his code, but introduces his finger into a scanner that scans the veins.
The experiment is expected to last for six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Tracks to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
“If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in cash for thirty seconds less, it’s appreciative,” explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: within a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you tailored options.
And finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
“Digital fingerprints are stored on a first server; people’s identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure case, which is blocked if you try to move it,” says Philippe Robin of Thales.
But, in the absence of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
The privacy specialists, they, continue to be concerned.
“The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, scare me the worst: widespread surveillance,” predicts Andrew Patrick, of the Canadian Privacy Commissioner.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was given an almond of <0xC2><0xA3>1,000
A driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the Braintree A120 on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they found the drink to be carried between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn on his permit led to a 6-month permit withdrawal.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a fee of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a victim surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>100.
A Tax on Foreign Real Estate Owners to Blast the London Bubble
The Treasury provisionally encrypted the measure of the capital gains tax but awaits a final decision from Mr Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, recorded a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than <0xC2><0xA3>2M and annual fees for buyers who choose to own individual properties within a company.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, and represents <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeastern United States, Northeastern and Yorkshire region.
Mr. Cook said: “Following the increase in the stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-evitation law on the matter, it is very difficult to advance that high-value properties are taxed independently of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system.”
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Prestigious real estate – the 5 to 10 percent highest real estate market prices – in the prosperous sector in southwestern London, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8 percent over the past year.
Prices in downtown London show a steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but have been eclipsed by a growing “internal market,” the city’s southwest (7.4%) and northeast (6.5%), according to Savills’ studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how a dog’s tail movements are related to his mood.
Previous studies have revealed that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs move it more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “Everyone knows that, in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions.”
Here, we tried to see what it was like in other species.
He added that just as in humans, the right side of the brain in dogs was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that both hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disordered tail movements of other dogs, the researchers followed animals watching movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will certainly not take long for us to understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We presented to dogs movies that featured other dogs – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion – and we were able to traffic the tail movement and present it as going more left or right.”
When the animals saw a dog without expression swinging the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog swinging the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they noticed a tail turning mainly to the left (again from the dog’s point of view that pushes the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other thanks to these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added, “If you meet other dogs several times and notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail toward one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react based on this experience.”
The researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Canine Behavior Expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol’s School of Veterinary Sciences, said it was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a cheerful dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said, “Dogs would go more easily to a robot dog when his tail swinged to the left rather than to the right, rather than becoming anxious – the opposite of what is stated in the Italian study.”
He pointed out that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs who participated in the different studies did not fully consider movie animals or robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“While many elements, detected in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why their tails sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpones concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed with its singer.
Sheffield's band was due to take place Friday in The Hydro's downtown concert hall.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reprogramm the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to postpone a concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone the concert at LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1.
“Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert.”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will take place on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals to the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest men of church in the Catholic Church behind the Pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – so it belongs to a group of 120 “cardinals electors”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which the bishops will be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinals voters will likely have decreased.
He said that a pope generally nominated as many cardinals as it took for the number of cardinals to reach 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wanted.
The consistency of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a tendency to favor Europe and Italy in particular.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be elected since Francis formed the council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world in charge of examining the means of reforming the church.
In the past, the pope decided alone.
“From now on, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He added that it was “absolutely possible” for Francis to seek advice from the cardinals.
But we’ve never seen such a situation – it’s totally new.
Valero said that the popes generally raised bishops representing large communities as cardinal, but that Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will appoint.”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the U.S. to fix seat records
General Motors Co recalled nearly 19,000 of its all-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to solve a problem with manually tilting records, according to a statement Friday by the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats may have a flaw in the inclination mechanism.
As a result, the files do not comply with federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
“If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the headrest may not properly protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injuries,” the statement was posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between August 1st and September 10th.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of pickups of the defect during the first fifteen of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the newsletter to owners due to the 16-day closure of government activities, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra.
GM’s stock price rose 1.4% to <0x24>37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
Worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker has died buried under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday afternoon in Montreal.
The drama took place around 11 a.m., on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie district.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations has been taking place here for some time.
A mythical foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred at the time when the victim had just arrived at the site to retrieve his tools.
I was passing by in the car and I saw the wall collapse with a large cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered him.
We could only see a part of his back, it was so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his fifties who worked for a boxing company.
Reanimation maneuvers were attempted by the emergency services, but were unsuccessful.
The man has not survived his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was sent to the site to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The cry of despair of an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says Obama has made commendable efforts overlooked by Republican Party obstructionism
Obstructionism doesn’t excuse Obamacare’s difficulties or drone attacks
The memory of Obama’s 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a medical student in his 2nd year at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
It’s a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the morosity of the second year of medicine and give me hope.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and it’s the memoirs of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical accounts of my patients in the evening and I lay down, this book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could blow you away.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and the news reporters took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades cried with joy and my parents kept all the journals they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transitional period before he took office in 2008, he had 82 per cent favourable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it’s like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I place great achievements on Obama’s credit, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of Iraq from our army, to the end of the “not seen nor known” and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the field of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the Obama administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the verge of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the listening of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the indictment of the complainants who reveal the government’s misdeeds.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without a trial, or the avoidance of public funding and the exceedance of allowable spending during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since Nixon’s administration.”
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a single website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the political opposition party and the events that happen by chance, such as Newton’s massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of the administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his nomination.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and poorly refined alternative that did not seem to allow him to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we have been hearing for so long.
However, while the favourable opinion index has plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He makes me wish for the many promises that have come to pass.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses in favor of Clinton at the Pennsylvania Primaries.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and remain faithful to their cause.
“I want us to re-establish our talent,” he said.
We must remember who we are.
Here we are five years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3:00 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car took place on Retinne Street in Fléron.
The 26-year-old Jonathan, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the rescue, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from the system.
The mining magnat, who contests the payment of a <0x24>6 million carbon tax, argued this argument to try to evade questions about a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial at the time of deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to personally benefit from these policies.
“He will have a major conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially stated that Palmer won the Sunshine Coast seat in Fairfax by 53 votes, after counting.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of a remanufacturing of the voting system to accelerate the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can enter, enter your contacts in a computer, vote immediately, and get the result at 6:30 a.m. the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a paper pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has examined possible options with regard to electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection document with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his policy project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions “very seriously.”
Exercise of public service is a matter of public service.
“We’re not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we need to serve the community at a critical time,” he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of dolphin on the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, Scientific Mission Officer at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marine Environments (OCEAMM) returns for L’Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Are you surprised by the discovery of this new species of dolphin?
It’s good news, but I’m not particularly surprised.
While species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographic basis in the past, today the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge in species classification sciences.
Moreover, it is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to question the classification or affiliation of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are being challenged due to advances in genetics.
In the same way, two very close species have been distinguished morphologically thanks to genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
About a decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific squid dolphins and Atlantic squid whales.
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important discovery, as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral outbreak or accidental catch occurs in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than the local extinction of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered to be endangered or in danger of extinction depending on the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility that it has to recover from neighboring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, from which the population of the new species discovered has emerged, its stock has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
The marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there is many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene brewing limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, than to know what lives in the Marianne Cave, just 11 kilometres from the surface of the sea.
We spend more money on the search for life on other planets than on marine research, and it’s time for that to change.
RBS Suspends Two Traders in Exchange Market
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange division according to two sources close to the file, which shows once again that the global regulators’ investigation into currency market manipulation suspicions begins to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in the most important financial market surveys in the world, where <0x24>5.3 trillion is changing hands each day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the extension of the investigation that echoes the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
“The ongoing investigation into this case is continuing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” a bank spokesman said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file said that RBS had sent files of emails and instant messages, sent to and by a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as European Cash Trading Manager at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of cash trading at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been indicted.
Mr. Usher’s file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, added sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had filed a lawsuit against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspected currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
Around the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are reviewing allegations made about bankers who would have agreed to manipulate rates on the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources close to the file said.
Banks are sneaking up instant messages and emails sent over the years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
The news about these surveys has shocked traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines of investment bank trading units in recent years, but which has been challenged this year due to the low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast exchange market heavily liquid, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to start to have a little impact on the market.”
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had sent back a trader working at its London Stock Exchange fund office this week after it caused a loss of <0x24>6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was controlled,” said a representative of Credit Suisse.
The investigation into Mayor Rob Ford has been stalled, a lawyer says
After police confirmed that they had put their hand on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Me Clayton Ruby said he had never seen an investigation "so skeptical".
Me Ruby told The Canadian Press that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford’s friend and occasional driver, 35-year-old Alexander Lisi, and accused him of extortion in relation to the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed the man delivering packages to Rob Ford, according to new court documents.
Me Ruby called it "inexplicable" the fact that the police have never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or put his phone on, claiming that police chief Bill Blair has deliberately chosen not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and carried out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an immediate search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman, Mark Pugash, described Me Ruby’s statements as an “evident and desperate attempt” to make a claim to the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a press conference on Thursday, Blair said there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable motives" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European scholarships drop in mid-session, except London
With the exception of London, major European stock exchanges are evolving downwards on Friday at mid-session, plunged by some news of disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
Moreover, investors remain cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could unleash its quantitative easing policy earlier than expected.
On the contrary, after the announcement of an inflation rate of 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea spreads among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could soften its monetary policy.
Wall Street's futures are predicting an upward opening of U.S. stocks after two consecutive rebound sessions.
At value, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest rebound of the CAC 40, plunged by a warning on the result of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (6.26%) is the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after also publishing downward results this morning and announcing the internal creation of a "bad bank" structure that brings together 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
Vodafone (<0x2B>2.45%) remains at the forefront of EuroFirst300 growth in response to a press release calling for AT&T to study a possible OPA.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation about the ECB’s monetary policy is going well, as John Hardy, a strategist at Saxo Bank, points out.
The ECB’s unique mandate has always been on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at next week’s meeting.
We are anticipating a strong potential for the euro to fall.
In this context, the euro continues its rebound against the U.S. currency and hit a two-week low of <0x24>1.3517.
These same assumptions, on the other hand, support the euro area bond market.
Supreme Court Approves Obama’s Health System Reform Act
Big victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared that the Obama-approved health system reform law was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) – which requires citizens to subscribe to health insurance by 2014, under penalty of having to pay a fine – and stated that it was constitutional under the rule of law.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page law and considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold to Medicaid should be lowered under the penalty of loss of all federal funding of the program, was compulsory.
The law-blocking procedure was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates in the running presidential election during the 2012 primary, including nominee Mitt Romney, have vehemently opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to former fighters in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as numerous patriotic associations, gave this Friday afternoon a tribute to the soldiers and deceased of all wars.
Deputy mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities deposited gerbes in two of the three military squares of the cemetery.
Israeli-Palestinian Clashes at Gaza Border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded on Thursday evening during a violent clash on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory in a year.
The Gaza Strip's only power plant ceased to operate on Friday after a fuel stockpile was depleted, the Palestinian Enclave Energy Authority said.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abou Bakr, and another Hamas military branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank gunshot during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younès, a medical source in the suburbs of the south of the Gaza Strip.
Two other local officials of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later on.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
Attack on a Tunnel Buried by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer invaded the territory for a hundred meters before retreating.
The clash lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri paid tribute to the four “heroes” and claimed that Israeli soldiers had been killed in the clash.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell by defending the territory during an incursion by the Zionist occupier in Khan Younès.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman said.
The Israeli military said the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug in Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and targeted, according to the military, “terrorist activities.”
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, saying the goal was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive device targeting the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and wounded five soldiers.
Israeli Attack in Northern Syria
"This mission was imperative due to the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," said Army spokesman Peter Lerner.
Israel also attacked an air base in northwestern Syria, targeting a cargo of missiles intended for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, satellite Al-Arabiya reported on Thursday.
A U.S. official confirmed an “Israeli strike” but did not give details on the target.
“In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah,” he added.
Officials of the Israeli government refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" she has not named, the Saudi capital chain said that "the bombing targeted a cargo of ground-air missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that fights the rebels alongside the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, had reported several explosions heard on Wednesday morning at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquié, on the Syrian coast.
The organization, based on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents in Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by inks and poems by Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopédies de Satie.
An evening that allows you to see the whole Chouinard prism, from art to tics and from black to white ink.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, also white, in the immense space that is the Théâtre Maisonneuve, advances, of profile, fine as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, a Henri Michaux ink is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes its form.
And this form will be that of the whole room: a pile of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on each side of the playing area, hurry when the next graph appears, embody it, emerge in the current.
This black-and-white play by Henri Michaux is performed in solo relays, in group at unison (a group that makes solo), in large group of twelve solos where each performs his signature.
One thinks of "Glory of the Morning", where Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, placed online at the forefront of the scene.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is strong, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be breakdown when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance carpet, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux's poem, monocord and monotone in the cry, and will continue dancing.
And the music to start again, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up suffocating and tingling.
As well as the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - creating images has always been a force at Chouinard - such as those hairs that shave or those black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It feels like the choreographer, instead of going to meet the work of Michaux, has imposed herself, with her tics.
The result: the bodies look flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux’ inks, like Gestalt shapes, open up a broader and more vibrant imagination than dancing, more porous.
Only the end, negatively, with its dancers haunted by a stroboscopic light and white signs in a sudden black theater, touches magic.
The audience liked it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedias, after the entrapment, is richer.
The scene is partly draped in grey, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, such as furniture in a abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers gathered to play the scores.
Their music misdirections, touching, give a real fragility.
On stage, couples pass, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving ensembles, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffons, also familiar to Chouinard, with a red nose, appear in highly polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnivores, fugitives or players.
The gesture, the laughter and the small cries transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridicule of the bodies, of the beings that melt.
But the piece takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown returns to the scene when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the cabotinent dancers descend among the spectators, glow, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness are transpiring, and it's Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are prosecuted for Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former patents from Nortel has launched an avalanche of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company it cut to the pole during the auction of patents that took place after Nor's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for <0x24>4.5 billion, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the U.S. Court of Appeals in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow you to display advertising in relation to search terms on the Internet, the conclusions of the trial indicated, which is the core business of Google.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that run under Google’s Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of <0x24>900 million for Nortel’s patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, eventually offering <0x24>4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel's patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for <0x24>12.5 billion, a market partly based on Motorola's patent library.
“Although it failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, Google has violated and continues to violate those patents,” the trial’s findings said.
Rockstar claims more damages and interests against Google because it claims that Google's patent infringement is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a faulty water heater causing the explosion
Grandma said she turned on a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion in a house in Gesves, which left two serious wounded on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a leak of gas from a faulty water heater, the deputy prosecutor said Friday evening.
The expert on the spot sent by the prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
Grandma turned on a cigarette while there was a leak and gas accumulation.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is still committed.
Grandma was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was next to him and was burned lighter.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on the premises before being taken to the CHU in Liège, she took a helicopter and ambulanced her," said Mayor José Paulet, who had come down to the premises.
Traumatic, the grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion.
Healthy and except, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the CPAS.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the Arches police intervened.
Crisnée’s civil protection has stabilized the two buildings.
Egypt calls on first freely elected president to take oath
Mohamed Morsi has lent the pledge, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he lent his pledge of office to the presidency, becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Moubarak who was expelled from power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the Supreme Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He took an oath before the Court’s 18 black-dressed judges whose building on the banks of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a successive fundamentalist group formed by his government for over 84 years.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the Court to applaud the new president and, distinguishing themselves from the presidential fast of the years Mubarak, the traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy in the very frequent streets connecting the suburbs to the city centre.
Considered as the uncharismatic “help wheel” of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown considerably since his victory and his Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work that began during the 2011 self-insurgency.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, wearing a blue suit and a red tie, addressing judges in the decorated wooden room where he took an oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he delivered his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national anthem while he was on guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song “The People and the Army, Hand in Hand...” toned by thousands of people gathered in the university’s large amphitheater.
Founded in 1908 and former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, from where the uprising ended the authoritarian regime of Mubarak last year, and vowed to regain the presidential powers of which the military council, which replaced the defeated former president, deposed him.
But by agreeing to formally take an oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is in use, he leans to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi’s speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
U.S. shutdown slows car market growth
The 16-day closure of most federal administrations weighed on U.S. car sales growth in October, according to figures released Friday by manufacturers, five of the top six performing below expectations.
Detroit’s three major manufacturers show two-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors has done better than expected.
Analysts anticipated an average of 15.4 million annualized and adjusted sales from seasonal variations, but the market was estimated to be 15.3 million by Adam Jonas, analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank’s customers, he said this slight braking was primarily explained by “the government shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first fifteen of the month.”
However, GM reported a nearly 16% increase in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by consensus.
The Group’s four brands have seen their commercial performance improve from October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pick-ups, saw its sales progress from 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194,301.
For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced a 11% increase in its sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also have sales below the consensus, despite a year-on-year increase of 8.8% and 14.2%, respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, the GM stock was gaining 1.4% at 16:35 GMT, while Ford yielded 1.1%.
Renault plunges into stock market by Nissan’s warning
Renault accuses Friday of the strongest fall in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced it had dropped its annual net profit forecast by nearly 20%, traders report.
Nissan, which had to undertake such a review, also announced a revision of its direction.
Several traders reported that Renault's stock was affected this morning by the "warning".
“This is clearly Nissan’s profit warning,” said a trading officer from a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan Alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan’s capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French, according to data from Nissan’s website.
Greece: Two dead in shooting near neo-Nazi party premises
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by gunshots by two people who were on board a motorcycle passing in front of a Golden Aube Neo-Nazi party premises in the western suburb of Athens, police sources said.
At the moment, the police were unable to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of the Golden Abbey had claimed the victims were local guards.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police of the anti-terrorist service rushed to the central avenue of the suburb of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place, and locked the neighborhood.
The incident comes a few weeks after the indictment of six members of Aube Golden, including the head and founder of the party, for participation in a "criminal organization" as part of an offensive against the party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's Appeal Rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be suspended for the next two league champions matches of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expulsed against Barça for striking Neymar, the Scottish midfielder saw his suspension extended to three matches by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was “very disappointed,” saying that his appeal was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 households are deprived of electricity across the province, shortly after noon on Friday, due to violent winds hitting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentides with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the dark, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The large area of Montreal also has a lot of disruption with nearly 7,000 private powerhouses in the metropolis and Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its forecasts of net profits upwards and expects record results thanks to vacationers from Australia and the UK.
The travel agency is now expected to make a substantive profit for the entire fiscal year between <0x24>325 and <0x24>340 million before taxes, compared to a previous forecast of <0x24>305 to <0x24>315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of <0x24>290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
The CEO, Graham Turner, said Flight Centre had achieved 8% profits in the first half and that the second half had begun in force, particularly with regard to non-business trips to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and many of them are on track to achieve record results for the entire year before interest and tax deductions,” he said.
This applies to Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector boomed during the second half, compensating for a slight decline in the domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, the Flight Centre leisure travel sector has recorded good results while business customers have spent less.
Its U.S. subsidiary recovered its losses during the first half of the year, where seasonal demand was lower and was expected to benefit from the overall fiscal year for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre’s shares increased by 3 cents to <0x24>38.20 yesterday.
Unknown shooting at hotel near Cairo pyramids
Unknown smugglers opened fire on Friday at a hotel near the Cairo pyramids in Egypt without any casualties, as a result of an apparent dispute with fired employees.
The attackers fled, a spokesman for the interior ministry, police general Abdel Latif, said.
This attack occurs when Egypt has received virtually no tourists since the army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and bloody represses the protests of its supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English literature courses, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to the present.
The review will also introduce “new texts” to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
Starting in 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate English literature qualification.
The Department of Education is due to publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical review.
It will make changes in other key topics next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Examination Regulatory Office, will unveil a restructuring of the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was “a broad consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public trust,” stressing that CSEs would be “more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours per year, that is 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singapore students make about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to mathematics, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of mathematics is in-depth – as well as the greater importance given to the subjects in the international rankings – it would encourage them to take more time.
The program will focus more on “real-world problems”, including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a text of law adopted in July in that State and largely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An eight-year-old welcomes children with a gun at the Muy for Halloween
The 9- and 13-year-olds went door-to-door to ask for candy at Halloween.
One of the neighbours of the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old man told the gendarmes that he was afraid.
His weapon was seized.
Former Gestapo chief buried in Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without any trace of his being found, was actually buried in a common grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a communal tomb of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he told the newspaper, based on archive documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime, would respond to one of the great post-war riddles.
In the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were totally wrong.
"As of August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary tomb near the former Reich Aviation Department by a command," according to Tuchel.
He was wearing a general uniform.
“In the left inside pocket were his state of service with a photo,” he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the district town hall of Mitte in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the district.
The President of the German Central Council of Jews, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
The fact that one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormous amount of bad taste.
“The memory of the victims is grossly crowded from the foot,” he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the most important figures in the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and under his orders was Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle delivers free health care in Cameroon villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, only 1 in 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of CNN’s 10 Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect him as “CNN Hero of the Year”.
This person will receive <0x24>250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to come to his aid.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma from which he would carry the sequels for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him overseas if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could benefit from.
“It’s not easy,” adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m., go to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation.
Two in five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country’s health expenditures are in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Dr. Bwelle explained.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed more than 700 surgical acts for free over the past year.
He became a physician himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas over the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they land in vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and crossing hard terrain to get to the villages that need the most help.
Luck doesn’t always follow them.
They had to push vehicles many times to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best housing available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overwhelming energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people on each visit,” said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive bouquets, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the practice team of simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, town hall, or home; after the intervention, the patient rises and goes to the wake-up room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the electrogen group, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It’s an exciting pace, but the musicians in the villages generally help the team stay motivated.
“They hit drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgical acts for free over the past year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those they come to help.
A man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
“This will change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to living this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, that finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in the Dr. Bwelle group.
He is still in the hospital or is trying to find money for his association in order to run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, it's an opportunity to learn on the field that they don't have at home.
“We were able to participate in operations to help sponge the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley said.
It’s not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you’re studying medicine in your second year.
Volunteer students generally pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
“It’s a hero, there’s no doubt,” said Katie O’Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not nearly extinct.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” added Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and alleviating pain are the reasons that motivate me to do this.

The Two France by Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheaters and classrooms?
Undoubtedly, but by emphasizing his weakness for crossing paths, Sciences-Po, the Higher Studies.
Arbiter of other people's works in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Yes, but by ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the publisher.
Heir to the chair that Fontenelle occupies at the Académie française?
Sure yet, but knowing that such a saint could not replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, of which he passed.
They gladly recognized in him a great awakener, animator and federator of their work, but noting that he was not inclined to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of "Memory Places", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The evil languages were able to see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a vivid eye-opening, but incurably amateur.
The two books published by Nora nearly two years ago have already established that the one who passed by not to write had a lot and well written.
The book here should definitely give him justice.
Yet, once again, there is the temptation of ubiquity, the intellectual vagabondage, the retirement set to jump like foot-joined from one subject to the other.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the brocantor back to one and the same passion: to discover the constituent node of the French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: It is a concern of the time.
In short, we have been collectively invited to give a definition of this.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders at the time, the French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobism compulsory, was entrusted to the prefects and subprefects, authorised interpreters.
The one that traces Pierre Nora is completely different.
It does not stand as the heir of eternal franchise, it refuses to define.
An analyst concerned about a familiar curiosity, he errs in a forest of symbols, arrested at every step by an object in the form of rebounds, tormented with annoying questions.
So this one, who is born of the company itself: why, in a country so permanently settled in its borders, so formerly carved and solidly masonized, do these dramatic calls to unity be understood?
They are not so urgent, Pierre Nora suggests, but to conjure up the disorder born of the discords of French history.
Francs and Gauls, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division, here, are very ancient.
And the most iconic of course is the one that divides national history in two.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchy, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but did not succeed in denying it; concerned, on the contrary, to find its sacrament and all the more avid of unity and indivisibility that it had cut off its head to the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And, hence, an invinciblely binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make you feel this uniqueness of the French identity, nothing is worth the four steps outside the Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora’s American escape could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have one and the other made a revolution, written a declaration of rights, wanted to establish a new society.
But American colleagues do better to emphasize what is clean for us.
There, men who had left their former regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men in charge of an ancient indigenous regime, and even more radical.
There was a consensus revolution when here she sowed drama and confit.
There are always honoured founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors, of whom there are hardly any models, and who have been intertwined.
There is an institutional constancy, and here there is a cascade of constitutions, as well as many mistakes to catch and attempts to resume.
France who is leaving, France who is coming
However, there was a time when the French believed they could cut the torn dress from their history, and defeat the curse of number two.
In this Third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a lot of interest and even tenderness: saluting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscurely prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity only had a time.
Here it is again in debate, buzzed by an immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France leaving and the sketchy circumspection of France coming.
With, in premium, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
We found out that the truck was a housewife.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The lizard was standing in the center of the center.
And the one who had deposited, more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of a nation, but had withdrawn from the initial exercise of the thesis, trusts us, cum grano salis, that he will finish doing it.
Certainly in a less rough, more bursting and more subtle form.
But we are not mistaken, equally binding.
For much more than the figure imposed on the university course, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
Former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is complicated enough to manage"
Abducted in Beirut on March 8, 1986 with three members of his "Antenna 2" team who came to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostage-defense association "Otages of the World", which he presided over for several years.
Its main objective is to have the opportunity for hostages to file a complaint and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Detained for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital of Val-de-Gràce on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, gradually, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, a former great reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde".
On the night of your release, you were on the plateau of "Antenna 2" at 8 p.m.
What are your memories of your liberation today?
In particular, in Beirut.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing him because he's black - Roger Auque.
He tells me we're freed, but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very tense too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They put us on the edge of a alleyway.
There are Syrian military personnel.
We then arrive at the Hotel Summerland where the press is present.
The French are taking us to the French Embassy.
It's time for the first wire shots to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in t-shirt at the French Embassy.
I also remember a short night to talk with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua boards.
How was your arrival on the French soil?
We land in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a bit brutal.
There's an incredible bousculade.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three television channels.
I'm coming back and there's plenty of it.
The descent of the ladder of the plane, the encounters with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The motorists pull the butter to take pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do a little police to stop some from climbing.
The media pressure is huge.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see it clearly.
We get out of a hole and we're suddenly under the media fires.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to handle.
But we did the hardest.
In the evening, I'm at 8pm, the next day I'm on TV too.
Then start a kind of rehabilitation to life, very gently, for a month or two that are a bit like holidays.
How did the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing go?
I was entitled to a first medical checkup in Corsica.
The rest was done at Val-de-Grace the following days my return: radios, exams of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything, but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about the hostages.
It made sense.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the liberation of the four hostages of Niger?
I'm listening to what's going on.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things annoy me, others less.
I'm trying to make the difference between the questions about my past as hostage and my presidential hat of the "Otages of the World" association, which allows me to put away, and I find it much more interesting to address.
For example, I am wondering about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I fight, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there is a problem with semantics.
It is necessary to call the taking of hostages "political" - which is the case most of the time - and to allow hostages to have access to justice, to complain and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for this.
Why not say to the hostages, "you have broken the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, you will be brought to justice"?
It seems to me, however, to be justified, legitimate, struck by common sense.
This message is heard, but not heard, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi trial
Anger in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of deceased President Mohamed Morsi opened, they went down the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country’s first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial underlined by this Muslim Brotherhood activist.
So far, no lawyers have been able to meet him and no volunteers have been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a fake trial insurging a pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to make Sisi judge, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacres.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses 9 U.S. states of violating gay rights
Since the federal state recognized homosexual marriage, "all spouses of military personnel have the right to an identification card of the Department of Defense and the benefits that come with," the minister recalled in New York in an address to the Anti-Defamation League of Anti-Semitism.
“But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities” located on their territory, he denounced, accusing them of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defense said he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The nine-state grid began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on the Texas National Guard deployments, as a result of a conflict between Texas law and the federal law on homosexual marriage.
It was joined in its rejection by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior Defense official.
The Pentagon estimates that the population affected by the recognition of homosexual marriage is about 5,600 active people, 17,000 including the National Guard, the Reserve and the retirees.
Sixth edition of Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard will take place on Saturday 2 November at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registration will take place on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and qualifying phases will begin at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 15 a.m. and the awards will be delivered at 16 a.m.
The audience will be able to admire the technical skills of young people who, for some, already attend the competitions at the highest level, like the young hero Lorenzo Palumbo.
At just 10 years old, he has already won his place at the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he doesn’t like anything until he goes back to competitors who beat him by three heads.
Mayor of Toronto chases journalists who come to question him on a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of taking drugs, according to several media outlets.
A video brought to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested, Rob Ford, has always denied having consumed crack, while acknowledging having a helm for cannabis.
On Thursday, he expelled several journalists from his property to question him.
We also think that sometimes images don’t need explanation or comment.
A case of rage detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
Authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, manifestly of foreign origin while France has been free from indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on 25 October in Argenteuil and died on 28 October.
The diagnosis of rage was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been undertaken to identify and take care of people who could have been in contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 inclusive," the Ministry of Health and Agriculture said.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
The departments now call on people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or on a skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal has been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 18 a.m. from 1 November.
"Since France has been free from rage since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not free," the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture specifies that the last case of "indigenous" rabies recorded in December 1998 on a rabbit and that "France was officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Bureau of Epizooties (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
“Rage is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time,” the departments recall and it is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the onset of the first symptoms of the disease.
Obama is stepping back on health system reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama came back yesterday on his unambiguous and often repeated promise that “if you’re satisfied with your health regime, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their suppliers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
“The vast majority of people with the right health insurance can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls a “effervescence in the news” about the terminations, President Obama encouraged Americans who received these warnings to seek new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to get complete and better fit health diets for the same price, or even for even less than expected.
“You’re going to win,” he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5% of the population who contract their own insurance were forced to change their diet because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Allow me to address directly to these Americans: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius at his testimony before the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had failed “deplorably”.
“I’m as frustrated and annoyed as anyone else,” she added.
I'm looking forward to regaining your confidence.
Kathleen Sebelius is an exasperated woman who uttered this phrase, while she believed her microcut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the sitting of the Assembly yesterday following an exchange of controversial views with Billy Long.
For more than three hours, Billy Long has not stopped asking Mrs. Sebelius why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to sign a regime via HealthCare.gov, which she boasts of millions.
Vettel launches special headphones in Abu Dhabi
The lucky winner, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colours of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the track level.
The German Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula 1 world champion, sparked a special headphone for the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday, which was designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen from 1,500 designs sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of its sponsors, an automotive brand.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and can therefore see closely the German champion, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday, for tests.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, destined to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his party from the suburbs
Don't be fooled, especially.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Part of the suburbs" is not only addressed to suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, it justifies.
When I speak of suburbs, I address all those who are excluded from the great national family.
It does not prevent, his project, presented on Thursday at a press conference in his native municipality of Aubervilliers, was born from the will to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that is characteristic of all the neighborhoods.
My proposal No. 1 is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, territorially attached, today claims to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are attached to the left, but if the right people are willing to support me, I will listen to them too.
There are only extremist parties that I don’t speak to.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program -consultable on the Internet - from many themes supposed to talk to suburban residents and especially young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civilian majority at the age of 16, the rehabilitation of the guardianship function...
It remains to be found candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this could be fair, he admits."
It's a matter of time and money.
The Party of the suburbs should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my nomination and I hope in other cities as well.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune already has seven listing heads in metropolitan France and Martinique.
“And the support emails I’ve been receiving since yesterday aren’t all out of the suburbs,” he says.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage “had gone too far inappropriately”
John Kerry indicated a sharpening of the U.S. defensive attitude towards his surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions, espionage "had gone too far inappropriately".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had ruled on “automatic pilot” when a series of incendiary revelations by denouncer Edward Snowden about NSA espionage activities emerged.
The leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: “It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have learned of certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War, from the difficult cold to the safe of September 11 years to the safe Guru.
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had crossed borders, but insisted that everyone’s rights had not been violated.
He said: “In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately.”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and clarify clearly to the people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse as part of this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force acting for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to jump.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have prevented aircraft from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered because we were able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. spy case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism efforts with the U.S., the Europeans said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken in front of members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had posed regarding a possible withdrawal from anti-terrorist organizations due to the feeling of frustration raised by the National Security Agency's surveillance.
“It’s really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism,” said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and president of the U.S. Senate’s European Affairs Subcommittee.
And I’m going to go to Europe to make them understand that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some of the U.S. allies, but the director of the agency said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned the metadata collected by the U.S. states and the U.S. allies.
Other revelations have reported documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone and those from 34 other heads of state.
The director of intelligence services, James Clapper, justified the allies' espionage by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this atmosphere of turmoil, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a Congress trip, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He said the route was still to be defined.
Murphy said the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show “feeling firmness.”
He explained that European heads of state should be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programs they have been implementing themselves for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world to spy on,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Kerry plans to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to deal with the rancor generated by U.S. strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, plunged by Shell’s bad results and the day after an announcement by the Fed to maintain its support for the economy, as expected.
Australian woman appeals her sentence of imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for allegedly wrongly assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released under bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first convicted by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her early on Sunday.
However, video surveillance footage later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she confessed to inventing the story of all the pieces.
She was detained in a cell of the local police station before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention center in the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women’s prison.
This is the daughter of former Australian rugby league player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Foreign Ministry to help her daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“Of course, we have had a distressing moment, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the trial and was released after a bail of 50,000 baht was paid.
In Australia, the press said it was on vacation in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increased sentence of up to two years in prison and an incarceration in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to redo its deteriorated image with tourists, which could lead to an execution.
French police will arrest Anderlecht supporters who came differently than with RSCA cars
French police have decided to set strict rules for the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, police spokeswoman Marie Verbeke said on Friday.
Belgian RSCA supporters who wish to attend this Champions League match will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former Rekem border station to the PSG stadium," the spokeswoman said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters intended to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has announced that measures have been taken to allow arrests or even guards to be carried out," Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys
At the school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys, 62% of students have a native language other than French.
This was the reason why a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and members of the education staff motivated us to reflect on ways to better integrate pupils who live on horseback between multiple cultures.
The school commission has just unveiled its vision of "Living Together in French".
The Vision Diversity organization has been advancing in schools for a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common references that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of the tribe or come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
“So we create projects in a way that they identify with all of this,” said Aida Kamar, President of Diversity Vision.
Michel Venne, of the Institut du Nouveau Monde, identified several challenges for the school commission.
“On the transmission, for example, of what Québec culture is, the feeling of belonging, the support of staff in the transformations that we experience, within the student clientele,” he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has set up a research centre that will provide tools for teachers who, too, sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
The preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
“Different pedagogical strategies, that’s the real need,” she summarizes.
Research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistics, schooling, social and cultural.
