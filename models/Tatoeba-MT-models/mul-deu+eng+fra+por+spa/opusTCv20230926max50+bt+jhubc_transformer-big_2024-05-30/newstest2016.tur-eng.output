Professor Admits He Killed His Girlfriend by Calling 911
University Professor Shannon Lamb, who is calling 911, told police that he had shot his girlfriend with a gun and that the police had to come home only a little ticking.
Lamb said his "lovely dog" was alive and probably sad, and that the woman's parents' phones could be on the woman's cell phone.
The police found Amy Prentiss' dead body in the house and a note written in a white notebook, "I'm sorry, if I could get everything back, I loved Amy so much and she was the only woman who ever loved me."
Two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, Lamb has found no way to find that he has already taken 300 miles to the school campus where he thought he was shot and killed by his beloved history professor Ethan Scmidt in front of his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said officials heard a shooting at 10:18 p.m.
Lamb also said he had made the emergency 911 call shortly after that.
At the end of the day, another death occurred: Lamb committed suicide as the police approached him.
One day after the school shooting caused students and professors to be locked behind closed doors, authorities were still investigating what led Lamb to do so.
Both sides of the state drew a talented but probably troubled teacher's picture of the details of the students and staff who knew him as well as the investigators.
The students said they were looking forward to attending her class.
Prentiss said a policeman in Gautier, where he died, said there was no criminal record.
In a book he wrote, Schmidt even referred to Lamb as one of the "other people" he shared his academic life with.
Both attended the Department of Social Sciences and History, which included 17 faculty members, and many students took lessons from both.
However, there were also indications that there were spiritual problems.
Brandon Beavers, of the students he spoke of with praise from Lamb, said that he was also a anxious and anxious person and that he appeared to be "as if he had a problem".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him that he was under stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously stated that he had some health problems and asked for medical permission from Delta State University.
This year, I only learned two lessons from the internet.
Recent changes to the University’s recruitment policies could not guarantee that Lamb would automatically become a post-teacher, despite the doctoral degree he worked hard to earn.
Dean William LaForge said he didn't know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt but that "the Lamb obviously had something in mind."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After the campus was cleared, the police tracked Lamb's journey from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Washington County Forensic Investigation Director Methel Johnson said his family's home in the suburbs of Greenville had committed suicide with a single 38-caliber gun before Lamb was arrested in the backyard of a house about 1.5 km away in the suburbs of Mississippi.
Lamb's car was found working on the highway.
Although it was not immediately determined why Lamb went to this house, Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people living in this house.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb began working at 3,500 students' universities in the city of about 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 and gave courses in geography and education.
He received his doctorate in the field of education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as a smart, charismatic and fun person.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 when she met her colleagues through the media, while Lamb said she was 20 years old.
Carla and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was a very nice guy who tried to teach guitar for a few years.
At the time, he was the one who beat his heart fast.
The 40-year-old, who lives in the suburb of Jackson, Brandon, told Lamb, "When he came, all the girls would die."
Lamb and Prentiss apparently had been together for a while.
While Lamb said on the 911 call, "I killed my wife," there's no official record of them getting married.
They had a dog named Lightning living with them in their brick houses on the banks of a river in Gautier.
Police said the dog was in good condition.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago but were always friends with Prentiss and now have a 19-year-old daughter.
O'Steen also said his daughter was completely destroyed.
He and his mother were two wonderful friends.
She said she had never met O'Steen Lamb but heard that Abigail's daughter was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met Lamb and Abigail when they were on stage at a summer festival three years ago.
Then Lamb and Abigail played together in the general shows.
O'Steen said that she wrote and said her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse working in various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, who is a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the 5th of September after finishing guitar and drumming for a small number of spectators.
There was no sign that there was a problem.
He said they were a very happy couple.
Sometimes we cut and we row each other.
They both had a great sense of humor.
Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the same university, said Professor Schmidt was running the first-class seminar program and was an expert on the history of American indigenous and colony.
He was married and had three young children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas and was also chairman of a student solidarity group he founded.
On Tuesday night at the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, around 900 people attended the candlestick ceremony, which included academics, university staff, students, and local visitors.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the memorial ceremony where the university choir sang the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Wonderful Gratitude".
Classes will continue on Wednesdays.
"We're trying to bring our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time to wrap the wounds.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (New Orleans) contributed to this news.
This text was corrected to reflect that the police had called 911 after Lamb had killed Schmidt and that, despite Lamb's mentioning Prentiss as "wife" in the 911 call, there was no official evidence that the couple were married.
Toys R Us plans to buy less holiday season items
Toys R Us has announced that it will not employ as many holiday season elements as last year, but the toy and baby products manufacturer said it will give existing employees and seasonal workers more work opportunities.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, which was 45,000 during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work will be part-time.
The company said interviews with candidates will begin this month and that the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Although the holiday season is still months away, the holiday shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees who will help them sell, send and distribute products.
Michael J. Fox Makes Expires on 'Affair' with Princess Diana
"Return to the Future" was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also very important for personal reasons.
In the documentary Back in Time, which is about to enter the new vision, he says: “We were waiting for the Royal Family members to come in and suddenly I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and I realized that Princess Diana was sitting next to me.
The film started, and I realized that dating the Princess of Wales was a fake sneeze and arm tension away from me.
A documentary about the film "Back in Time" includes interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future was first seen 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "This is the most exciting time travel movie ever made for me."
In addition to the Back in Time VOD and DVD formats, it will also be shown in some select cinemas.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Speaking about Russia’s growing military support for Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the nearly five-year-old Syrian problem could “not be solved by military intervention” and that more weapons would only be more violence and pain for millions of people.
The UN Secretary-General also invited all sides, including the divided UN Security Council, to come together to find a political solution to the issue and to hold constructive talks.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that five permanent council members planned to meet with the U.N., China, Russia, Britain and France's foreign ministers at the UN General Assembly's management meeting to be held towards the end of the month.
He said he was deeply saddened by the split between the council members and the Syrian people that the regional powers "make the problem unresolved".
Ban has invited five permanent members to join in the Syrian crisis, as in Iran’s nuclear deal.
8 Survey Figures That Show Donald Trump's Seriousness
Some people have tried to label him as a criminal.
The others looked like he was joking.
And some are supporting the internal explosion.
Although some Republicans tried to drag Donald Trump down in the polls, this (still) didn’t work.
The last 11 national polls have shown him Donald Trump's leadership in double digit numbers, and some are seriously beginning to question the chances of a real estate emperor being nominated.
Of course, it's early in the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump will be able to win the Republican nomination.
Experts say Rick Perry's rise in 2011 led to a rise for Herman Cain, both of whom failed to win the nomination process in a single state.
And there are many reasons why there will be trouble in the general election.
But outside groups, such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC group and the Economic Conservative Group, are aware of Trump’s lasting power and are beginning to spend their dollars to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey results that show that the real estate emperor is not just temporary:
Trump's election rates have changed 180 degrees.
A poll conducted at the University of Monmouth shortly before announcing his nomination in mid-June showed that two of the 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate emperor.
In mid-July, that was 40 percent.
It was 52 per cent at the beginning of August.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Three out of 10 people say they have negative opinions.
And these numbers are rising in the early ages.
Last week in Iowa, a poll in Quinnipiac showed that 60 percent of Republicans there preferred Donald Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters may be happy with Trump’s nomination.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would have been "wishful" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 people said they would "be raised" if he was nominated.
Only Ben Carson creates enthusiasm at the same level as Trump (43 percent say they will be “enthralled” for Trump, that’s 40 percent).
The closest person to Co<0xC5><0x9F>ku?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
47% of Republican voters, on the other hand, say that if Jeb Bush, the institution's favourite, is a candidate, they will "not have me" or "will be raised."
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s betrayal as a problem.
While criticizing Donald Trump for his speech and humiliation, he believes that 52% of Republicans questioned according to Monday’s ABC News/Washington Post polls have the right excuse to be president of the real estate emperor.
The same figure applies to Iowa, where the country's first party board is to be held, and 52 percent of Republicans believe that Quinnipac has the personality to be the leader.
44% still think they don’t have the personality to serve effectively, and according to ABC/Post, six out of 10 independents say their treasure does not belong to the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When they wear political experts hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of 10 people said Trump was the best when asked who was the best candidate to win the GOP nomination.
A change since the end of July, when four out of 10 people deposited their money to Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, the crystal balloon of GOP voters was not very clear.
During the last round of the election, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would be nominated, while only 28 percent chose Mitt Romney, who was ultimately nominated.
It is still seen that the majority of GOP voters think Trump’s election campaign is overwhelming.
Even if Republicans gather around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented area could also contribute to Trump’s prominence, and a fact that anti-Trump support has spread among more than a dozen candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September showed that in the event of a possible match between Trump and many Republican candidates, Trump receives the support of the majority every time.
Carly Fiorina is 13 points, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz.
You're the only one who can beat him?
In case of a possible breakdown, Ben Carson passes the businessman with 19 points.
Donald Trump’s supporters say the vast majority have made their decisions.
A new CBS/NYT poll published on Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump are blocking votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen to change this, and no one can say that they really won’t change their mind.
46% said they left the door open to change candidates.
Trump’s biggest competitor is still brain surgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they make their decisions are twice as close to voting for Trump.
Six of the Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
In a campaign announcement two months ago, Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "a rapist" on the topic at the beginning and at the center of 2016 talks.
Some think that Trump’s far-reaching speech will distract important Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and damage their re-branding efforts.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as the immigration issue remains on the agenda, Trump seems to remain on the agenda.
The government's anger is rising to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson take up half of the Republican votes largely due to their external circumstances.
Six out of every 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post poll on Monday say they want someone outside instead of someone with government experience.
And they're mad at Washington, too.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey in Iowa found that three out of every four Republicans in Iowa were angry with Republicans in Congress, 54 percent were "unreasonable" and 21 percent were "extremely angry."
Prime Minister Jeremy Corbyn will be at the summit for the first time.
Since Mr. Corbyn's election, he's been eagerly awaiting the Prime Minister's Issues Summit.
New Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will take the lead in the Prime Minister’s Questions for the first time after David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will ask six questions shortly after noon, and his performance seems to be closely examined by the media and Labour Party Members.
In his weekly show, he called for "less theater and more real."
He also said he could skip some sessions by leaving his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbyn’s leadership, appointing the shadow cabinet and following his speech at the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader’s silence at the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the British War on Tuesday was also criticized by some Tory Members during the reading of the national march and at the helm of the front page news in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision to accompany the national march was noted.
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he was standing in "a reasonable silence" and that the Royal Air Force appreciated "the heroism of the British War."
But Owen Smith, one of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet members, said in a statement to the BBC's Two Night News program that he would advise the Labour leader to call the national march "independent" from his belief in the abolition of the monarchy.
While about a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in the top team of Mr. Corbyn due to differences in economics, defense and foreign relations, fewer than one of the six in the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
The BBC's political reporter Robin Brant says political differences within the Labour Party are also beginning to "empty up" and that these are issues of the government's upper limit application to Mr Corbyn's position in the European Union.
Mr. Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party was proposing new changes to completely lifting the upper limit.
Hours later, Shadow Work and Retirement Minister Mr Smith said the party was opposed to the government lowering the <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 ceiling to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000 and that it was "very open" in this regard.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Party leader to meet at the orphanage summit from the date of David Cameron's being the Conservative Party leader.
The Labour Party leader promised a different approach to politics and said he had received more than 30,000 recommendations to ask Mr. Cameron "popularly".
MEP Islington North said the Questions programme was very preventive and would focus on poverty, inequality, and the challenges facing young people instead of making a sweeping swath of words with “reasonable education.”
Mr. Corbyn said when he was not himself, for example, when Mr. Cameron travelled abroad, he would represent himself as Angela Eagle, the shadow trade minister, in the Prime Minister's Questions program.
He even suggested that other colleagues would come to this stage from time to time, and told Air House spokesman John Bercow that he would address the issue.
When he was the leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron often admitted that he wanted to move away from politics in the "Doll Game" style associated with the Prime Minister's Questions program, but a few years later he failed on the issue.
Since it was first published in 1990, the Prime Minister's Questions program has been used as a fundamental measuring point for the decision-making capabilities of leaders, to measure their positions between the authorities and Members of the House of Commons; in contrast, some critics have suggested that this has been reformed, and that it has been widely understood.
'Retired in Joburg': Homeless teenagers take photography training
The city center of Johannesburg is a difficult place for homeless people.
But a group of old street kids found a way to gain a new talent and make sure they pass.
I was in Joburg, a not-for-profit studio that teaches homeless youths to take pictures of their neighborhoods and earn from it.
He met one of the first graduates of the BBC News project.

Sterling rises with the acceleration of wage increases in the UK
While data showing a rise in fees in the UK showed a rapid rise in the pound, the FTSE 100 index also rose following the purchase offer for SABMiller.
The UK premium-except fees increased by 2.9% from the same period of the previous year between May and July.
This rate, which represents the fastest increase since 2009, is also seen as one of the leading indicators for possible interest rates increases.
The sterling rose by more than 1% against the US dollar to <0x24> 1,5505, and by 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 Index rose by 1.49 per cent to 6,229.21 points.
The company that hit the most in this upsurge was SABMiller, which recorded a 20% increase with an attractive purchase offer from its competitor, the EU InBev.
It will merge the world’s two largest breweries and will meet well-known brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch under the same roof.
Burberry’s shares rose by 0.9 per cent as a result of positive earnings from its rival luxury retail group, Richemont.
Richemont’s current sales figures have also shown that it has risen above expectations, as well as that sales are starting to rise again in China, one of the key markets for Burberry.
The mining giant Glencore's shares rose 5% after it said it had received <0x24>2.5 billion in allocated share sales as part of the company's debt reduction strategy.
Packaging and paper group Mondi's shares were among the most-valued shares with a loss of 4.3% following Goldman Sachs' bid for the company.
JD Sports’s shares rose by 3.1 percent after it said the company’s six-month pre-tax profit had risen by 83 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million.
JD Sports boss says higher salaries could be detrimental to expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill said the minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But he said the power of this spending, he said, would not be able to pay the high-performance costs of his own company.
He also added that the costs would affect JD Sports’ expansion plans and that this could mean less extra work.
Metcash launches public campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores in South Australia and Western Australia from an Aldi attack.
Market wholesaler Metcash has launched a public campaign to defend its retail stores in South Australia and Western Australia against the <0x24>700 million Aldi invasion.
Aldi is preparing to open the first of its two distribution centres and 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers, and are committed to promoting meat and wine branding in Adelaide, as well as their main trade fair.
IGA retailers and suppliers also offer a taste test at IGA stores with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo and loyal customers with store owners selling discount football league tickets to South Australia.
Food, beverage and equipment wholesaler Metcash is expected to provide more details about the defense strategy as it organizes its annual investor strategy day on September 29.
The risk is high, since South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30% of Metcash’s IGA store foot permit and produces higher profit margins than the IGA network in the eastern states of Metcash.
Shop owners in South Australia and Western Australia are negatively narrow and IGA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they get in NSW, Victoria, and Queensland; 30% more in GA than in eastern states and 24% more in the U.S.
But analysts like Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will capture about 5% of the market market within the next 12 months of opening its first stores in these two states, and that sales will be taken from existing players but generally unpaid retailers.
In a report published this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath predicted that IGA retailers would lose <0x24>360 million in a year and Metcash would lose <0x24>250 million by the end of 2016.
This estimate is based on the estimate that Aldi will open 25 stores in GA next year and 30 stores in the U.S.A. and will receive <0x24>500 million and <0x24>600 million in sales in each market.
Mr. Kierath said the loss of food and market sales and Metcash's high fixed cost base volumes could cost Metcash about <0x24>13 million in interest and pre-tax earnings.
At the same time, despite Roy Morgan’s recent research revealing that IGA customers are the most loyal customers, Metcash is losing its market share in the eastern states primarily, including Aldi and Coles.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash’s food and market sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017, and 2.1 percent in 2018, bringing its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent in 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group founder Hamish Douglass, the chief fund manager, said that Metcash could "most likely be erased in ten years" at a business dinner in Melbourne.
Metcash refused to respond to Mr. Douglass' comments.
But it's clear that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has declined from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash’s revenues from food and market operations, which supply approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43% since 2012, with sales and margins falling as they enter under pressure.
But the wholesaler is resistant, helping IGA retailers to renew their stores by investing more than <0x24>150 million a year for matching rack prices on hundreds of products each week at Coles and Woolworths, adding faster-growing fresh foods, and a better market labeled range.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says price matching and store renewal programs are starting to work, and the wholesaler is expected to return to core profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by Australian tennis president Steve Healy.
Thanasi deserves much praise from critics for Kokkinakis' behavior.
According to Australian tennis president Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis was in an accidental condition in the last storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves much praise from the critics.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the talented duo commonly referred to as the "Special Ks", found himself under unwelcome spotlights due to Kyrgios' facial friction at the Montreal Masters.
During a tough element game in Cincinnati in the afternoon, Kokkinakis and rival Ryan Harrison left by file judge twice, Harrison found the statement: "Wawrinka came up on Kyrgios, and I have to go up on that kid."
Kokkinakis, seen breaking his rocket to potentially miss Richard Gasquet at the last US Open, was loyally defended by Healy.
The young player is currently competing for the second singles position behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals in Glasgow with Sam Groth.
Healy said, "What I feel so excited about is that I don't think a little Thanasi is being debated."
He broke his rocket when he closed in the US and when he lost, but he wasn’t the first player to break the rocket because he was disappointed, and I know Thanasi shouldn’t be proud enough.
But in fact in the U.S., Harrison and others managed themselves pretty well under extremely probative conditions and I think he deserves a full compliment.
There's a great team around there, a great family, and I think it's a little too much.
Although she is 19 years old, she is extremely mature, she works a lot and also adapts to the team, she has no problems with other players, she is very respectful in the dressing room, she is doing tough workouts, a very balanced and mature young man and she is judged in her own entourage according to me.
Healy also supported the decision to welcome Kyrgios for an important partnership; from Friday, he began to explain that the right thing for everyone was "to make a mutual decision" but to support Canberran to return to the team as a long-term railroad leader.
Healy said: "We want the team to focus entirely on the match, not on the clashes around [Kyrgios].
And to me, the boy, as people like Nick, Federer and Murray pointed out, grew up very quickly, growing in front of the public, and he made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's received, but we're trying to think that he's supportive, that he's underpinning, that we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, that he's underestimating, that we're trying to help him.
Europe’s Migrant Crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and overlooks migrants
Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, declaring a state of emergency to cut the flow of migrants, and took into account those attempting to enter the country by illegal routes.
With the accumulation of hundreds of migrants in the impartial region, the border has created chaos, and the Serbian authorities have moved in anger.
Migrants fleeing violence in their own countries set up tents on the side of the road between the control points of the two countries for an uncertain period of time.
But their anger was growing.
As a police helicopter passed over, migrants shouted, "Open the border!" and insulted Hungary's agile force police.
Some of them rejected the water and food they were given to them.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Serbia said that while the flow of migrants from Macedonia and Greece continues, Hungary's repatriation of migrants was "unacceptable".
(Serbia) wants to be a part of the solution, not to be harmed by this process.
In the coming days, talks with Brussels and other countries will have to be held," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
This tension on the Hungarian-Serbian border arose just a day after the 28-nation bloc’s meeting in Brussels failed to agree on a common immigration policy.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 migrants who attack Greece and Italy, and hoped to agree to accept another 120,000 migrants from Hungary, which will also be present in the EU by the end of next month or year.
Germany’s Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Austria called for an EU summit next week to address the continent’s immigrant crisis.
Hungary is not very confident that Brussels or its neighbours will take any concrete steps on the issue.
The emergency call in the two southern regions on Tuesday gives authorities extensive powers to fight the crisis, including to close roads as needed and to speed up refugee-related cases.
On the other hand, Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said he planned to pull the cable along the border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants from Serbia after the country’s dredging.
CBS News reporter Charlie D'Agata announced that even prisoners in prisons were employed in wire drills between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become an important narrow passageway and transit point to the European Union countries, and most of these migrants are refugees fleeing wars in Syria and other Middle East countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most of the incoming migrants are "economic migrants" who try to move to Europe for a better life than innocent people who are fleeing the war - the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
Laws that come into force in Hungary at midnight, in addition to the fact that the 4-metre (13-foot)-long rope drawn to the Serbian border, make it a crime to make it a crime, even more severe punishment for human smugglers.
In a statement to reporters in the southern town of Szeged, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said: "Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring an emergency."
One thing is very clear: crossing the border illegally is a crime.
While the talk is still needed to be approved by the assembly, Associated Press reporters in the area say they have seen heavy-armed dogs and armored soldiers here for days.
Orban's domestic security adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said the authorities had captured 15 people who crossed the border with 45 trying to cross the border.
They've gone through the damaged ropes, now they're charged with police custody and committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are quick to repair the wires.
Hungarian authorities also used a train wagon covered with ropes to close one of the seven border crossing points with Serbia on Tuesday morning, while they closed two of the seven border crossing points with Serbia.
It also reflected the main border crossing point near the chaos near Roszke, along with the introduction of a small metal container where people were filled with clicks for Hungarian transactions.
Twenty people were able to enter, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants said they would not accept food and water aid until they were allowed to enter Hungary by closing the highway between Serbia and Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's predecessor to Bernie Sanders halved in national elections
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues her two-digit leadership in the Democratic race for national nomination, but Sen. Bernie Sanders reaches her.
While Clinton currently holds 47% of Democratic votes (down from 58%), Sanders ranks second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet declared whether he is in the presidential race, receives 15% of the democratic vote.
More than five months before the start of the main races, most Democrats were saying it was too early to decide which island to support.
Clinton’s supporters, however, have stronger ideas about their choices than other candidates.
Last month, since CBS News, Clinton has lost its ground among a number of demographic groups, Sanders on the other hand has some gains.
Clinton is leading a big difference between women and moderates, but this difference is closing.
Support among the men has dropped substantially, and Sanders is only following him 5 points behind.
Clinton's Democratic voter advantage under the age of 50 has evaporated, and he and Sanders are now in the same position.
But Clinton has a big difference in terms of older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sander with two-digit squads between the liberals, but now Sanders is 5 points ahead of the group.
At the national level, nearly half of the Democratic voters say they will passionately support Clinton if the party is an island.
While a quarter supports certain conditions, another 15% cut will only support him if he is a candidate.
A six-percent cut doesn't support Clinton.
Perhaps, not surprisingly, Clinton’s existing supporters tend to support him with passion, especially.
The views between those who don’t support Clinton at the moment are even more confusing—only a quarter can passionately support him.
While 48 percent of Democrats say they will support Clinton with passion, fewer Republican candidates talk about Donald Trump (35 percent).
When asked open-ended questions about why Clinton wanted Clinton to be nominated to Clinton’s supporters, the following answers had the right experience (16%), the idea that now it’s time to elect a woman president (13%) and the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also criticized his relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Being conciliator in problems and selectability are among the criteria specified.
As a vice-president with the potential for the presidency, 57 percent of Democratic voters may want to see him in the race, but a third of the unity cuts don’t think that way.
When asked what the Democratic voters were the second candidate for the party, Biden was at the top.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say that, according to Sander, Biden could be the second choice between the open and the gap.
Unless Biden enters the Democratic nomination race, Hillary Clinton's superiority to Sanders increases; Biden's level of 20 points rises to 30 points in a race where Biden is not.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters consider Clinton to be the best candidate for a general election, but this figure went from 78 percent last month to this level.
Although Biden was second in this regard, a lot was behind, but the percentage of those who saw him as the most selective candidates showed an increase.
Once again, when asked what is the most important thing in a candidate, the Democratic voters hold the issues in front of their eligibility.
Last month, no Democrat electorate or candidate appears to be considered a candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or candidates perform well among the primary voters of their party in some key characteristics.
The majority see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy, as well as people with strong leadership qualifications.
While Biden is in the top of the three in terms of honesty, Clinton is strong on leadership.
Thirty-seven percent of Democratic voters say Clinton is not honest and trustworthy, and about half of them say the same for Sanders (15 percent) and 27 percent have no idea about it.
Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden in the same direction as their own ideology.
In all dimensions, a quarter of Democratic voters have no idea about Sanders.
While questions about the use of a personal e-mail address and server continue during the Ministry of Foreign Affairs position, most Democrats find the explanation on the subject satisfactory and indicates that their views on it are not affected.
But this is a different story in the American general public.
Half of Americans are no longer satisfied with his explanations, but only one third find it satisfactory.
The public's views on this matter were divided in March, shortly after the problem was taken under siege.
Most Americans say that e-mail clashes do not affect their general views about Clinton, while their negative opinions have increased to 36 percent on the other hand.
They are generally Republicans, and more than six in 10 people say their views on Clinton have been violated.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by the voters of his party, it is still a problem among registered voters in general: only 32 percent of the voters saw him as honest and trustworthy, eight points compared to last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don’t find it fair and reliable.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not find Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump are getting good grades on the leadership.
Among the six candidates who took the test, Biden, Carson and Bush scored the best in honesty.
More than that, Sanders is often honest, but as in Carson, most have no idea about him.
The margin of error in samples taken from 351 Democratic votes was 6%.
Ben Carson is right behind Donald Trump in national polls
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, Ben Carson is running behind Donald Trump
The new poll shows that about half of the two candidates competed in the game, and the other candidates didn’t have much luck.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, rising to 23% in the latest CBS poll that preceded the debate on Fox News last month, to 27% in the poll released on Tuesday.
However, support for Carson rose from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson was doing well in demographic groups as well, and that college graduates were much more supportive of Republican voters than Trump.
The remainder, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, fell to 2% from 10 percent support last month with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are third with 6%.
The margin of error of the most recent survey, which was made with 376 people among Republican voters, was 6% and the survey was made in September.
Last week, the latest CNN/ORC poll showed Carson’s support among Republicans rose to 19%, immediately behind Trump’s 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post showed Trump seriously in front of Carson.
Trump, faced with Carson’s rise last week, apologized for questioning Trump’s beliefs, but went on to randomly address his retired brain surgeon.
At a campaign stop in Iowa, Trump said on Saturday, “We need energy.”
Five Brotherhood Members of Baruch College Accused of Death of First Class Student
During the month of acceptance of a brotherhood in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, nearly two years after the death of a college student, murder cases against five people were opened.
In a launch month in September 2013, the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of New York City Baruch College violently attacked Chun "Michael" Deng and, according to police, contributed to his death by delaying his hospitalization.
Authorities said her eyes were closed, a 30-liberal sand-filled backpack was stuck in the back, and she was constantly squeezed while trying to walk towards the target in a frozen field.
Mr. Deng complained that he had a headache over time and later lost consciousness.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng fell in love, and according to police, they waited an hour before taking him to the hospital.
But according to police commissioner Chris Wagner, who spoke at the press conference, they changed Deng’s clothes, searched for his symptoms on Google, and asked for advice by contacting the Brotherhood’s national president, Andy Meng.
At this point, Commissioner Wagner said, the members began to store personal belongings and pointed out the brotherhood's goodness to Michael Deng.
He could not be resurrected, and he lost his life the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered trauma from repeated strokes in his head, body, and hips with a non-sharp body.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family, said in a statement that as a result of the Brotherhood’s acceptance ceremonies, many families have been destroyed, losing at least one student’s life at acceptance ceremonies each year since 1970.
Brotherhoods and members should be held accountable for this, and this step that the authorities take is very important.
The Grand Jury of Monroe City advised that a third-degree murder charge be opened for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with murder and punishment.
Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday that if there are not only people involved in the matter, we will hold them accountable if there is an organization that formally or formally approves it.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity ended its relationship with this local unit.
What happens when the Fed increases interest rates?
With the rise of interest rates, the bull market is on the rise and tax revenues rise, and the economy also records a rebound.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will last.
History, especially in economics, offers very little information about timing.
The rebound lasted as long as 86 months, just as the rebound occurred as soon as 11 months after the first interest rate increase.
The U.S. Central Bank’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often been decisive in the response of economic and financial assets, though not permanent.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials strongly stress that investors should focus not on when interest rates start to increase, but on how long the normalization process will take.
A fact that there are various variables.
However, as a result, market participants may think that interest rate increases have been declining.
In a note to customers, Capital Economics Global Chief Economist Julian Jessop said, "It is inevitable that the Fed's first interest rate increase has been interpreted as indicating that some have come to the end of the 'money-money' period."
On the contrary, we do not expect U.S. interest rates to slowly return to normal, but it is seen that most of the still low levels are afraid of a seismic blow.
We can't say they won't have any impact.
Based on past trends, the response that some areas of the economy can give is as follows:
As seen in the past months in the market, waiting for an increase in interest rates can imbalance some things for a while.
When the interest rate increases, the effect is not so pronounced.
In a new study on what will happen after Fed increases, Deutsche Bank analysts said, "it appears to be a 12-24-month downtrend after the first interest rate increase, which may reflect a downtrend in monetary policy."
According to a recent analysis shared by Bob Doll of Nuveen Asset Management analysts at Barron's, the market has recorded sharp rises over the last 35 years, with the market returning to a straight-line increase of around 14% after 250 days, with the return to interest growth of up to 4%, and a return to normal up to 2.6 percent in the last two days.
Deutsche said that the effect on shares was more pronounced in the subsequent stages of the interest rate increase cycle and that the bringing of the shares was about to be destroyed.
Tensions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases also help them.
In the current situation, the Fed is facing some situations that were previously unavailable and will accelerate the recession.
The most noteworthy is that the Fed’s net domestic revenue is at its lowest level to date for interest rate increases.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118-percent increase since 1950 has dropped to just under 4.5% twice a year with a nominal net domestic turnover.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed, the situation is expected to be permanent by very few, and the third quarter is at 1.5 percent.
According to Deutsche, it could be risky to increase interest rates in such a sensitive economic environment and lead to the question “this time it will be different.”
Market participants who have been waiting for the Fed to raise interest rates for a year will pay attention this week at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which will end Thursday.
While most strategists and economists believe that the FOMC can approve an increase at this meeting, timing trade only points to a 25 percent likelihood.
“In the research we’ve been doing since 1950, all of the increase cycles that have occurred to date are in a super-high trend cycle and reach peaks quickly after the accumulation, with a pure domestic rush,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was an unprecedented slow accumulation of samples without the worst reversal occurring in a period.
The current cycle has been the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since its last retreat – the longest cycle on record has been 35 months, and the cycle we’re in is still in the 74th month.
With the expectation of an increase in interest rates in the market, it has stabilized and has become volatile, and the order is similar to that of a nebze currencies.
The real difference is that when the Fed policy changes its gesture, the effect is seen faster than it is felt in the bills.
When the first increase/thinking of the drum comes, it does not immediately change direction.
At the end of the interest rate increase cycle, the tax returns immediately drop,” Deutsche said.
According to strategy experts Charles Schwab, interest rate increases will straighten the slope by approximating the yields between longer and shorter-term turnovers.
Kathy Jones, from Schwab analysts, who say that high yielded samples often perform better in an environment like this, said, but "we're careful about bringing to fruition."
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adapting to the Fed’s policy expectations.
“In addition to the decline in dollar strength and inflation expectations, there are various signals that the market is regulated according to stricter monetary policy,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are increasing, the yield curve is correct, credit spreads have expanded and fluctuations have increased – all features that will appear on the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Broadly speaking, companies that do most of their jobs in the U.S. will earn higher interest rates because local products will be more attractive.
The situation of multinational companies that are very indebted will be worse, as the rising dollar will make products more expensive in the global market, and debts will be even more expensive.
In a report prepared by Goldman Sachs analysts for customers, "History shows that 'qualified' stock shares can experience performance underperformance at the beginning of such an increase."
Companies with strong balance sheets surpassed those with weak balance sheets by an average of 5% in 1994, 1999, and 2004 following the increases.
Companies with high capital and low fluctuating equity shares also surpassed their low-quality competitors by 4 (percent) (percent) by an average of 3 (percent).
Debt will become a big issue.
According to Goldman, companies with high-wave exchange rate debts are likely to suffer the most damage.
In addition to the pure exchange game, it is predicted that consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Although experts have different opinions about how fast they will hold, savers can also benefit from high earnings.
Andrew Bingham said BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative MP accuses Andrew Bingham of 'disappearing'
He argued that the radio was becoming indifferent to its commercial competitors.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and accused him of smashing the British Awards.
Vice-President Damien Collins has accused The Voice of not being original.
A prominent spokesman for BBC Radio 3 pushed the broadcaster to reveal his difference to other commercial stations, saying that BBC Radio 3 was increasingly "converting" to Classic FM.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said the radio channel that provided public service to BBC bosses was "disappearing" and was largely indifferent to its commercial competitors.
"I don't like to use this term, but Radio 3 is "dissipated" and it's becoming a classic FM."
In addition, it also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which were held in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards launched last year are just another version of the Brit Awards.
Bingham said, "So if you're going to do something different, these are the first two examples that come to my mind, but you're holding on and copying the same thing that's already in the market."
The BBC director-general rejected the allegations that BBC Radio 3 is open to competitors in commercial education if it needs live music.
If I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn anything about classical music anywhere else.
And this is a commitment to live music, and making music is not comparable to anything else.
He also said that I think the effort of Radio 3 to discover new music and introduce its work is very important.
BBC Radio 3 director Alan Davey said earlier this year that the radio had to work more to reach more audiences, because he claimed that the British were less educated in the field of classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only component of the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports Selection that was held because the ball was pushed to the tail of the BBC's commercial rivals.
Member of Parliament Tory Damien Collins de O Vos - the music talent contest where the BBC received 22 million pounds of television from Dutch production company Talpa Media.
Can't you see why the program brings so much sound, because it's not original and there's no special difference?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 Show, which was juryed by Paloma Faith and Boy George, was made "in a more fashionable way to the BBC."
He said the organization wanted him to "find a hit from his own blood" before he could do the entertainment program again.
What is more, in the future he did not accept the idea of being blocked from making the audio program or spending the amount spent on the license fee on other formats.
Is it because of the lowest increase in internet sales in the history of Black Friday in August?
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7% increase in internet sales.
The lowest growth since last month's records began to break in 2000
Three years ago, when mobile devices began to be used in shopping, there was an explosion in internet sales.
Experts say Black Friday in November could be the reason why spending on black Friday is undermining
Online shopping has been exploding for more than a decade, turning Britain’s most lively shopping streets into a ghost town.
According to figures, which show only a 7% increase in internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts indicate that online sales are showing more and more signs of weakening.
In total spending in August, only a 5% increase was recorded compared to last year, and the lowest growth has been seen since 2000, when records began to break.
After figures showing only a seven-percent increase in internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts indicate that online sales are showing more and more signs of weakening.
Andy Mulcahy, the editor of the IMRG sales index, told The Guardian, “If you look at the growth levels of the previous years, and especially 2000, you’ll actually see everything goes back to normal over time.”
He also added that consumers began using mobile phones to buy the product three years ago when Internet sales recorded a significant increase.
This meant that even more people were able to shop while lying on a chair.
But right now it's going horizontal, you can see the landing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, a concept derived from America, is shown as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts say consumers can expect this event to take place on the last Friday of November to buy something.
In the last year’s event, many companies’ website collapsed when they attacked companies’ websites to get five times more consumers than the previous year.
Experts indicate that Black Friday, which indicates merchants are fighting for a discount, may have interrupted merchants "for now"
A study published by the British Retailers’ Association found that every <0xC2><0xA3>5 spent on shopping was spent on buying a product from the internet.
A third of products such as TV and washing machine are now purchased from online stores.
In addition, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes on the internet instead of luxurious and showy shopping streets.
Muslims have been successful on their last trips in the cruise accident that took place in Mecca with the founding of the family of bin Laden
After the first funeral in Mecca, 29 people who lost their lives were transported to the streets by Muslims.
Saudi Arabia has held construction giant Saudi Binladin in charge of the wreckage accident in Saudi Arabia
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were injured following the fall of the vicinity.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to carry the remains of 29 people who had lost their lives by falling into the Mescid-i-Haram.
Mostly the crowd inside the whites closed their first funerals to their final journeys at the Muaysam Cemetery in Mecca.
A painful crowd passed through the holy place where a mosque of a wine cellar was erected a few days ago and the tragedy overwhelmingly overwhelmingly overwhelmingly overwhelmingly overwhelmingly overwhelming.
At the same time, in the event of 394 wounded, the family of Binladin, the owner of the construction holding of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, was held responsible for the funeral of the deceased.
The 29 people who lost their lives by falling into Mescid-i Haram were moved on their shoulders along the way.
At the time of the death, there were four children from Manchester's Bolton area, whose father was November Akram.
Mr. Akram had come to Mescid-i-Haram with his parents at the beginning of the annual Hac worship.
Saudi leaders said Haqqani would continue with the participation of thousands of supporters on their way to Mecca.
King Salman said in a statement today that the Binladin Holding group should not leave the arm of the crankshaft open while out of use.
The Arabic version of the farm prepared by the Saudi Press Agency, operated by the state, stated that the only party to be charged with the incident was the Binladin Group.
The British news agency's service did not pass this detail, but the company's officials were reportedly banned from going abroad.
At the beginning of the week, Salman vowed to find the reason for the raid on the palace of Mescid-i-Haram, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came to Hac at the end of the month.
There was no explanation of the revolving coup, and its representatives were not allowed to comment.
The Royal Farmer accused the group of not taking up-to-date security measures and not cooperating with meteorological authorities.
Mescid-i-Haram, located in Mecca, is surrounded by dozens of wreaths, most of which are under the leadership of the Binladin group.
The Binladin family has been in close relationship with the Saudi family for decades and is the name of most of the construction project.
Al-Qaeda's last organization leader, Osama bin Laden, was a son of a mischievous family.
The accident occurred just a few days ago, at a time when there was severe winds and rain, before millions flowed into the land of Hac, where every adult Muslim was obliged to visit at least once in his life.
Authorities said 158 people were still being treated in the hospital.
Authorities have ordered the families of the deceased and the survivors of permanent disability to pay 1 million riyals (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000).
The other wounded will take half of that amount.
B&Q boss says there are cheap Eastern European craftsmen working behind this trend
Veronique Laury says the British are hiring more and more craftsmen
Behind this increase lies the number of master craftsmen in Eastern Europe.
As a result, 200 new Screwfix stores targeting craftsmen are opening up
Kingfisher also closes 60 B&Q stores nationwide
Written by Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail City Chief Reporter
It is said that instead of leaving the hammers and paintbrushes in the hands of the British, they started hiring skilled Eastern European craftsmen to do their homework.
If you are skilled in using a hammer or wall painting, you are a minority nowadays.
Because according to the company’s boss behind B&Q, the British are increasingly employing more and more masters to do DIY jobs in their homes.
Kingfisher’s new CEO, Veronique Laury, said there was a huge increase in the number of skilled East European craftsmen offering services at low prices behind this trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for craftsmen while closing 60 B&Qs.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted more women to be hired at B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store were made by women.
Currently, the majority of staff are men.
She said that single woman’s home, which does more home improvements than in the past, is a need to meet emerging demographic trends.
Mrs. Laury said: “The majority of men still work in our stores.
We need to get more balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women and 80% of decisions about products purchased are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laury, one of the top five women at the top of the FTSE100, has reorganized her top team to make up equal numbers of male and female directors.
Kingfisher, including the general manager and finance manager, is almost alone in this area, with 50 percent of the team’s staff consisting of women.
Mrs. Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find good women to get into our board of directors.
Kingfisher announced a decline in both low-month profits and sales after the cost of the group’s closed stores was charged.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher 200, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open a new store
Time for the U.S. Central Bank to raise interest rates for the Fed
The two-day meeting of the U.S. Central Bank on Wednesday and Thursday is being monitored around the world; a decision is expected to be made on whether interest rates will increase or not after ten years.
In a survey by Reuters, more than half of 80 economists said last week that the FED would implement this decision, they now think it would suspend the decision and keep rates between 0-0.25 percent.
It's been seven years since the Fed's rate down to zero, and it's a historic event.
Angel Ubide, a senior researcher at the Peterson Institute of International Economics, said: “For the first time, we will be witnessing a major central bank’s approach to the process of normalizing interest rates from zero.”
The U.S. economy is relatively well performing, and billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet in the process of revitalizing the economy, and it creates little inflation.
But the Fed cannot ignore the global picture, which is less promising.
He warned the markets against an increase, but there were signs that they believed the situation would not allow such a rise.
The decision will be announced Thursday at 8 p.m.
Delta State University filed a letter of apology for the murder
According to officials on Tuesday, Shannon Lamb is a note that says he was "true" for the first murder after he killed his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning with a gun and in the next hours of the same day before he killed his trade buddy.
The Mississippi Gautier police reported that Lamb, a geography and social sciences education trainer at Delta State University, called 911 at 10:00 a.m.
He said Monday and that he said he killed someone with a gun.
Lamb said he had to send a police officer on the phone.
"I killed my wife last night," Lamb said, "there's a sweet dog in the house that doesn't hurt anyone, and he's probably sad."
The police asked her to call her, but she didn't say her name.
Lamb didn't make any explanations about the murder.
When the police went to the scene, Amy found the dead body of 41-year-old Prentiss and a note written by 45-year-old Lamb: "I'm so sorry if I could take back time.
I loved Amy so much, and she was the only one who loved me so far.
Lamb, after writing this note, went to the Delta State, 300 miles away, and killed history professor Ethan Schmidt; then the police committed suicide by sniping him.
Dean William LaForge said he did not know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but "it was clear that Lamb had something in mind."
On Monday, despite reports that Lamb believed his girlfriend Prentiss had an emotional relationship with Schmidt, officials said Tuesday they had "no information or evidence" that he was a "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for about seven years, describes Prentiss as "a good one."
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but continued their friendships.
O'Steen said Prentiss and his 19-year-old daughter had been found and that the girl was "degraded."
O'Steen also said Prentiss and her daughter were "certainly each other's best friends."
According to Linsday Knowless, whom Sun Herald described as a close friend of Parentiss, he was working online from Prentiss' home.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owns a hunting dog called Lightning, had been with Lamb for about 3 years.
Knowles said, "He always liked to help others."
Police said Monday, calling Lamb's relatives, he said, "I won't go to jail."
That same night, police at Highway 1 near Greenville drew Lamb close to him, jumped in, ran to the woods, and killed himself by gunshots.
According to a CV published on the University's website, Lamb had received a PhD in education at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who lost their old charm
The actor (left) seen with his son Redmond (right) spent quite a stressful few years.
In 2001, she struggled with leukemia, and in 2009, her life partner, Farrah Fawcett, was diagnosed with cancer.
The actor, who is also allegedly struggling with drugs, was arrested in 2008 for drug use.
All of this, of course, hurt him a lot.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Manchester United’s Luke Shaw has been out for months with doubles
Luke Shaw's right leg suffered two breaks in the match where Manchester United defeated PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.
The event, which wiped out his defensive player's tears, hopes Louis van Gaal Shaw will be able to return to the field again this season.
The fracture caused 20-year-old Shaw to slip into the field like a bomb in the 15th minute of the match with Héctor Moreno.
He was intervened in the field for nine minutes and then needed oxygen before being sent to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's broken off his leg from a couple of places, and he's in the hospital right now."
Maybe he'll be shipped today or in a day, and he'll have surgery in Manchester.
An 18-year-old man who moved to Manchester must first have a hard time, then have a great game, and then have it happen to him.
He had an oxygen mask on his face while he was in the dressing room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you've got a fracture, it's at least six months, and it means you're not going to play in the group.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was fortunate to get rid of the red card and the penalty.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal pointed out that the Italian authorities made a mistake.
When I say it's a penalty and a red card, you can judge yourself.
It was a very bad fight with two legs.
Shaw's tweet said: "Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my path of recovery is now beginning, and I will come back strengthened."
Related: Manchester United is shocked by Luke Shaw’s disability in PSV defeat
The Champions League, which will be held in France next July, will be moral for the recovery of the English defense player.
PSV technical director Phillip Cocu said, "It's a very bad injury."
If such an injury occurs to any player, everyone is saddened by it.
The intention of our players is never to hurt their opponents.
Moreno also suffered a leg fracture while playing for the Mexican team against Van Gaal in the 2014 World Cup.
"Cocu finds this situation very difficult because his intention was never to hurt his opponent and it was never good after he heard that it was a very bad break," he said.
I couldn't see that moment in my eyes.
All I could see was the ball going in a different direction, as if Moreno had touched him, but I couldn't see Luke stealing.
In SBS 6, Moreno said: "I know what a feeling it is. I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel so bad about it, and I'm so sorry.
His fight with Chris Smalling was taken to the hospital in Andrés Guardado from PSV.
Does David Cameron know the Lorax better than that?
This is something that every parent soon learns: when your child loves a book, you know that it will hardly take much time to learn from it.
It looks like if you're not David Cameron.
When asked by a child-care vacation programmer supplier what was his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, Dr. Seuss' 1971 environmental story.
In a message posted on the company's website, Cameron continues: "I read to my children because this book, which is a comic, impressive, creative, and powerful message, has an image or message we've always skipped in its contents."
So far, everything was going pretty well, until the paragraph that Cameron wrote about the contents of the book, but actually summarized the new character and details of the 2012 film version, to inflate the contents of the original storyline.
A boy named Ted in the city of Thneed-Ville, whose walls are destroyed by all nature, and whose air is metaphorical, and whose real name is Theodor Seuss Geuss, who died in 1991, writes that he wants to realize his dream girl Audrey's desire to see a real tree to win her heart.
If this doesn't seem suspicious enough to you, it's very similar to the short text of The Lora in the Internet Film Archive, which starts with "Everything's Artificial and Even Ambient in the Name of Everything," which begins with the short text of The Lora Film Archive.
In view of her work's claims to be a wealthy parent, Cameron's unnamed young man's local neighborhood, Lorax, also named after him, is tired and "speaks for trees," despite the objections of the creature.
It's likely that such a weak Public Relations work has been carried over to an order, which he apparently hasn't read The Lorax to a child more than 20 times in a row.
A presidential spokeswoman said the text was thought to have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's staff, but there was no comment beyond that.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of England's expulsion, but still unhealthy.
Playing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task but I don't think there's a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeats that happened last time after seeing the British team chosen for the tour.
Still, I don't let a displacement win out of the way.
Alastair Cook’s team may be more inexperienced than they were three years ago, but there are players who turn well on the strike line, and the collective game concept is strong; they don’t heal the wounds of 2012, they only provide a bit of youth-based optimism.
In the mass game, Moeen Ali develops as the game's spinner, and Adil Rashid represents an attack option even if its quality is not known at the trial level.

The decision to remove Adam Lyth is a difficult decision for me to analyze as the head coach in Yorkshire.
The Seven Trials were against two good strikes under tough conditions and the simple but inevitable truth is that cricketers are judged by the outcome.
For example, there was no sign of any question about Joe Root, the announcement remained because - as I said before - players were their best choices.
After a few fiftieth serials, Lyth could have seen his career extended, but he set his own destiny.
If he works more for Yorkshire, I hope he gets another chance.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised the player's attitude despite not showing his best performance, which did not surprise me; first of all, he was a team man.
It's hard to answer the question of how long it will take for a test shooter to get a note.
Lyth - like Sam Robson before him - got seven stops, on the other hand Nick Compton got nine.
Compton's only got a chance to win the match.
The only struggle you can feel for Jonathan Trott may be that England first went to the Caribbean - while Lyth's form was at the top - but this wasted opportunity has been left in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and I think he's a high-level shooter.
He's an X-factor cricketer, and we saw this at the beginning of the season, when he scored 236 against us on Trent Bridge, in Yorkshire.
At least it should be able to be taken for the same opportunity as before, but of course it depends on the formation of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea that Moeen had an opening shot with Cook in order to get an extra game spinner while holding four quicks worked, and I'm not opposed to that.
I don't understand why a shooter can't shoot here, and this left-hander has already shown how good he is as a cricketer.
Moeen might not have done his job for the town of Worcestershire, but he saw a number three for them, and there's not much difference either.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests in his first drop before starting his 2001 debut.
He got the three-hundred-series right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari’s team comes as a backup gamer and surprised me as an impressive young man in my limited conversations with him.
People can see their gross statistics - 31 averages and 35 averages in a hit - and they might think it's a burn, but there are not too many spinners to lift their hands and the player's choices have been made since they were young.
You'll learn a lot on this tour.
Away from the team, England seems to have made a few plug-ins to its own coaching team.
Sri Lankan striker Mahela Jayawardene could be a move to be appointed as an advisor for the Test matches.
One of the game’s most cute guys will bring with him a full experience in every circumstance and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball leg of the round and gives a ruthless serial to both energy and game order.
I’ve always thought that he was born for the international cricket world, whether he’s a player or a coach, and he’s got a sense of guidance like Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room, even transmitting previously spoken messages, can bring an innovation to the team.
Colly's teammate Ben Stokes from Durham is rested for a day-to-day game, Root was given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
While not everyone agrees, plans, coaches, and players are not made by the choicers.
And you should remember that, like the players, their work depends on the outcome.
Decisions like this can never be easily made.
If the economy is stagnated by 2017, Brexit could win the camp
David Cameron's renegotiating strategy for holding Britain in the EU is getting worse every day, and this situation is getting worse with Jeremy's "Yes or No?" to be elected to the Labour Party's leadership, or TUC's departure from the European poll on Tuesday.
The aliens have Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
Recently, a fellow European diplomat has fallen into crises in the EU that some member states have not caused themselves, most of which they don’t want, Britain’s only self-considering divisive privileges and the agenda of abhorrent changes to the treaty.
TUC had decided that it would not want them if it harmed social protection at its annual meeting in Brighton.
We could even call it Dave and George's own agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor take their own pictures, whether they participate in summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals or in famous monuments there, and then say they are allied to return to their countries for reform.
It's all about me.
When Berlin said "Don't leave us alone with France," my European friend, who wants a British outside in the EU tent, came to a point where more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals don't care if we stay or not.
Chancellor Angela Merkel, Germany’s cautious and intelligible ally, has been in power for 10 years, and Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14 years), and Kohl (16) want to leave power without getting worse.
François Hollande faces a re-election or change of power in France in 2017.
He's also a force.
Soon a nationalist government from the right will come to power in Poland, and a government from the left will come to power in Spain.
For the Selfie Britons who need to use their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK, it is unlikely that these countries will make an effort because they don’t want it because most of them have separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers, like the Scottish National Party, may be planning to speed up the Brexit process by making intentional statements that would not be useful during the UK’s 2017 referendum campaign, my friend says.
"There would be no negotiation again" and "Britain has got nothing to benefit from the negotiation again."
Europeans knew how exploitative Fleet Street was, from previous experience, how oligarchic press barons were in opposition to the EU, as Tony Benn did not at the time, and they were the inspiration for the 1975 referendum in 1973, which approved our initiative by 2-1.
In the early 1990s, the Brussels reporter, Boris Johnson, the head of the Euro-portunist, who announced his name in the name of the "EU flat bananas".
Besides all the nonsense, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included anti-tax bastards, illegal strangers who listen to phone calls, and the so-called foreign settlers who have most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair often thought the same things about them, but he realized that he had to distract himself by giving him bananas to not feed during lunch and after tea time when he was confined to a cage of greedy gorillas.
In fact, the Miliband was Blair's opponent of Cameron's brilliant referendum idea, as Blair had compromised the principle of the EU constitution, which was repealed in 2005 by French and Dutch voters who gave him the exit card.
The press never forgave him about it.
But on Monday in Westminster, I told him I didn't have time to lose -- Jeremy Corbyn, Neil Kinnock, who now seems to re-approve Murdoch's boycott strategy in the '80s, which is a mistake.
While it will take time, it needs to develop a coherent strategy to be in touch with Andrew Marr, who left the BBC seat on Sunday, not with me.
I mean, Corbyn's official position in Europe is politely evolving.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most of the people outside of Ukip’s hostile tendency and the ardent supporters of the Conservative Little England say yes to this.
That’s what Hilary Benn, who is a Benn but is not a Bennite, said on radio and television this week, as she naively forced Corbyn to admit that her father-in-law as a shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
This reminded me of his father's struggle with disloyalty to his friends in the worker's cabinet in the 1970s and his loss of his job in the cabinet.
Hilary's struggle was more appealing.
But "Benn's statement - to struggle to stay "in every circumstance" - was the same as what McDonnell said, or what JC said to the Lords at a special meeting on Monday night.
Given the fact that it touches me, Corbyn continues to preserve the importance of message discipline, regardless of what the Christmas image is trying to convey, in the 7/24 era of TV and in the social media entry, which is known as paranoia and betrayal.
As McDonnell said, it is very reasonable for Cameron to have the support of the Labour Party guaranteed in the referendum, making it difficult for Europe.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the transitions of McDonnell and Corbyn’s EU membership to Bennite’s siege economy and anti-capitalist past are no longer a separate area between left-wing opponents, where only the fundamentals of the teaching hierarchy of small-difference narcissism are the fundamentals.
As in the NATO transition, Tom Watson - determined that JC will not campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will have to deal with some of these for their masters in their countries.
When they have their own suspicious voters, why should Paris or Berlin lose their political capital to Britain, where they can all be wasted?
As I was told at the opening of the British Impact Security Forum on Monday, the US is already very disappointed by the weakest performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, despite the cost-reducing Conservative Party government in power.
Experts Criticize UK Public Health E-cigarette Research
Researchers said e-cigarettes were 95 percent less harmful than smoking at a 12-person meeting of those linked to the tobacco industry by a government-funded agency.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the UK Public Health (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published a report last month, which it described as a "deeply detailed study of the decks" as a "point of reference".
But some researchers questioned the validity of the data and drew attention to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The headline of Lancet's medical journal last month targeted a "extremely decaying foundation" based on the main finding of PHE.
Two other researchers at the BMJ questioned whether the claims were "built on the rock or on the rock."
Martin McKee, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is to build on the nuisance of effectiveness policies."
They said the public's claims about PHE "are about 95% less harmful than e-cigarettes than the best current estimates" would be based on a thorough examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, a multi-critical decision analysis (MCDA) to create a synthesis of their views on the harms associated with various products containing this nicotine comes from a 12-person meeting, which was convened to develop a multi-critical decision analysis (MCDA) model; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research article.
McKee and Capewell said that one of the sponsors of the meeting, the CEO, was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which was previously reported to have been funded by British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also said in a sustainability report that the BAT also endorsed the public health promotion document.
They also added that one in twelve people at the meeting reported that they had received funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but that this was not previously reported to have received funds from the Philip Morris International cigarette company.
It is not known how panel members were selected, but among these are some of the well-known giants of e-cigarettes that some of them reported on the industry background in the article.
Other people who are ready for the meeting are not recognized for their expertise in tobacco control.
The person responsible for tobacco at PHE also attended the meeting.
McKee and Capewell acknowledged that the group's research paper was "officially" "lacking substantive evidence of most of the product's damages by many criteria."
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
MCKee and Capewell said the claims that "e-cigarettes have no evidence of a transition to smoking for children or non-smokers are too early."
Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Wellness at PHE, said the claims at BMJ had already been answered.
“E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking cigarettes,” he said.
One of two people who smoked cigarettes all their lives is dying of this addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks caused by e-cigarettes are small compared to those caused by e-cigarettes, but we need to continue to examine their long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty: to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, at a time when the damage is very confusing, when it is consistent with tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
The current evidence - although e-cigarettes are not risk-free - is that only a small part of the damage caused by smoking carries - we clearly carry our national responsibility.
Previous Channel 4 boss says the BBC should quit EastEnders
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and that adversaries could "give their right hand" to hit programs like Albert Square series.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used to make programs that are not made by other British publishers.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programs on channels such as BBC4, which is likely to be watched by a smaller audience, against rivals' highest-rated programs at valuable intervals.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the organization wanted to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said it had failed to do so for six years at its own time on Channel 4 to establish a connection with the BBC.
Johnson said during a BBC future query to the House of Lords Communications Committee that "I'm struggling with the idea that the BBC is clearly ordering and broadcasting programs that can be shown by its unsubstantial rivals."
If you continue to apply the license fee that I’m not sure it’s a good idea in the medium or long term, at least the exit should be reduced to programs that others don’t or order.
The Voice is broadcasting in the primetime range because they want to provide the widest possible support within the future.
The main idea here is based on the idea that no one else can publish, which is ridiculous and clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why programs that can be funded without help need to be funded with a reduced tax rate.
One is The Voice, and the other is EastEnders, and it is actually made within the company.
To be honest, other channels give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how the public service broadcasts are.
I don't think that's going to miss the BBC.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of running the ratings "for the passion of the people who work here and for seeing this approach as the best way to ensure long-term support."
Comments on the BBC's most popular programs are repeating comments of Tony Ball, a former Sky manager who used the MacTaggart class in Edinburgh in 2003 to offer the BBC to sell programs like the EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's more appropriate public service programs were going to BBC4 and could not make a follow-up measure here, but that they would receive a tax pardon and show you who would be able to continue the program in order to discuss who would be able to provide <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion of land on the license fee."
They're putting them in empty spaces that no one's ever gonna watch.
Speaking about the license fee, Johnson told the committee: “I invite you to find a more regressive system for those who benefit from it.
Of course you all think, we all think, 150 pounds a year is a big value, but I wonder if it's because they don't watch too much of the BBC for people with 150 pounds of money.
The previous Sky and Channel 5 executive, David Elstein, who presented evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its "information, training and entertainment" mission.
BBC's beer output is now officially classified as education - it's 1% of TV output and 0.1 percent of radio - and public service broadcasts in Australia and Canada need to be prioritized, and it's "not to inform, illuminate, and change."
Regarding the partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should only do something about a handful of Proms shown on TV and cooperate with advertising broadcasters in order to ensure that all of them are tracked online.
'Sonogenetics' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how they change direction when they are hit by the sound vibrations of the wire wolves.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound waves.
Small wire wolves change directions as soon as they are hit by sound vibrations that people can't hear.
The vibrations are powered by activating genetically modified motor nerve cells to carry the jaw ducts that respond to sound waves.
Related: Researchers Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said that wolfs have proven the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetics, so ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart, and muscle cells outside the body.
Researcher Sreekanth Chalasani Guardian from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, will be able to tell that one day this procedure will take the place of deep-brain stimulation, an interventional procedure that gives electrical vibrations into people's brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Threaded wolves often don't respond beyond sound, but Chalasani found that they reacted when surrounded by a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles they find strengthen the waves beyond the sound, allowing the wolf to pass through.
In addition to amplified sound waves affect what are found in the cells of some lobster cells and are called TRP-4 ion channels.
According to a report published in Nature Communications, sound waves allow these ion channels to open up and activate the cells they are connected to.
In order to create wire-controlled wolves by overstimulation, Chalasani genetically altered the wolves to allow some motor neurons to carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When applying ultrasound to altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by micro-bubbles and transmitted into the worms, and the motor neurons are also operated here.
This procedure has similarities with optogenetics, an optogenetic tool that enables scientists to run and shut down neurons with light vibrations.
But Chalasani says that sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike the light that needs to be sent to the desired point in the brain through an optical fiber, low-frequency sound waves can pass through the tissue uninterruptedly and can thus be transmitted to the brain through the skull.
“Using gene therapy and a curative virus, we believe that human neurons targeted in the clinical environment for certain neurological treatments can be temporarily made sensitive to over-audio signals,” he said.
It also added that other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-containing cells.
Unlawful torture equipment - at your doorstep!
Advertising Is Humiliating Britain's Weapons Trade
Watch the video of the anti-weapon exhibition of the International AfD.
Terrible killer drones!
Branches that break your ankle!
They're all bombs!
And electric shock cops that cause severe pain but don't leave a trace!
The fine sound and comic film, which is produced for the International Af Organisation, is the world's largest exhibition on the subject of fine sound and comic strips, which is designed to emphasize the desire to sell weapons to oppressive regimes through ExCel Defense and Security Equipment at the ExCel Center in London.

But a different campaign also continues with posters on bus stops and subway trains and requires to look twice.
In his letter, he turned the DLR line into a tank using its London Metro font and brand, saying, "Will you travel on the DLR between September 15-18?"
This September, a bunch of gun vendors are going to attack the DLR... asking customers to help stop this gun show.
300 posters from artists exhibiting the work at Bansky's Museum of Evil Designs in Dismaland.
A group called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute <0xC2><0xA3>6 and claim that "the bus stop on the planet gives access to about a third of the advertising spaces" using "Advertising Space Hearth Packages".
Transportation to London was not satisfied with this poster "vandalism".
One of the adverts was created by the private patrol group collective.
According to the curator of evil designs and professor Gavin Grindon of the University of Essex, artists are becoming more and more questionable every day and are looking for ways to transport political works to the masses outside galleries.
Many artists act with activists in protest movements, and they begin to realize that their arts need to come into the real world in order to have an impact on society.
Another counter-weapons trade poster also faces those travelling in the subway.
The video of the International Af Organisation was watched over 100,000 times over Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the free-to-play advertising agency VCCP and produced by the voice artist as well as the graphic designer.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was very surprised by the silence over gun show advertisements - with the vacancy on ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let's offer them a campaign they're trying to escape."
More realistic, they played with the idea of making an enterprise advertising, but "they've been more attractively decorated with bright colors and animation."
Tom Davies, of the Af Organization, said: "They have helped us a lot to create concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment in the country."
What we need now is to prevent the British government from illegally selling torture equipment in front of our door, taking action.
Perhaps the most creative art in the gun show comes from ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastic coating products.
In a press release, Saab showed the order of the U.S. military "AT4CS RS fired from us".
It has a "single-shaped warhead that hits a big blow by passing through the target armor."
Whatever he's doing, it won't be nice.
The Eight Golden Rules of Living in Student Homes
When I was a 19-year-old uninterested, I was 11 years old when I moved to my student homeland, and I still believe in morality and morality, but now I remember the smiling smiles that bother me - and the countless lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight golden rules.
Moving around can range from a nervous breakdown to a total of horror.
The reluctance of the whimsy: where people are, where they lose years, where they insist on Corbyn, and why you "do not openly love or hate Marmite, because really gentlemen, it's just a fairy tale HAHAHAH I'll be in my room."
Take a breath.
And let others get one too - ask questions and show the connection.
This will guide the conversation, and it will help you to distinguish what you like from people you don’t want to talk to if your eyelashes are holding and if they are burning the fire extinguisher.
Give people a little space.
People’s rooms often turn into drink receptions, cinema nights, and public gatherings, but they’re also where people dress up and put on their underwear.
Related: Don’t even think about starting a relationship with a university
The insiders are treated badly at the university.
Your room may be an inspiring place, but many country corridors develop a culture of intercourse between rooms, and this friendly is open to vibrant, social and lifelong friendships.
It could be hell for someone trying to store that energy.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go a little bit so I can replace the energy I spent while communicating with you."
Try to feel that a friend is tired of socializing and maybe throw a message instead of knocking on the door.
When you say knocking on the door, do it.
A friend in the student’s home had taken a policy as invited in if the door wasn’t locked.
He saw a lot of things.
Don't make friends by cooking.
Since you started college at the height of the madness of the food contest, it's less strange to introduce yourself by playing people's doors with a plate of brownies and less than the 1950s "Welcome to our bar, I cooked you something, now I'm going to ask you personal questions."
It's a great way to make friends by offering home-made sacrifices to people.
Your friends will feel compelled to talk and maybe they will associate your face with a sweet surprise.
Obviously, it's about being your master cook.
A well-mixed ball ball with a candy, sugar and oil will cause people to imitate sleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is a crime that is common in student homes.
Honestly, it's a robbery to roast someone's chicken, but steal a few drops of milk for your tea?
Check the owner's milk twice.
Even if he's probably swimming inside, he'll tell you to take care of yourself.
It's very annoying and I understand that someone is stealing things, but try to deal with it more maturely than my country friend, who put liquid soap to punish the thief's milk.
She's in jail now.
Do not make noise in a way that prevents people from sleeping or studying.
That's not just to be a proper person, but because you're the people in the glass houses.
A girl in my corridor told her neighbor on the side and drums a little bit because it was 3:00 p.m. and she had a morning exam.
The responses were to open up even more.
When they finally shut down at 5 a.m., the girl gently let them sleep for two hours before going to her three-hour exam by opening her own music and locking the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic for your future wife to move in the same corridor as you?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be strange that you have to misunderstand a corridor friend and think that you’re the future spouse, get stuck, leave and see him every day and watch your co-workers be taken prisoner?
Of course, this is heartbreaking, but if your hot corridor neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, at least talk to him and advise him.
When you realize in a joyful moment that someone has left the keys inside without locking their door, you know that the line between joking and harassing someone is thinner than you think.
A good joke is fun, but it will take time to get back.
You can teach someone a valuable and fun lesson in safety by hiding their belongings—but never pollute someone’s room with shampoo and toothpaste.
Lock your doors and place your keys in a glass of water in the freezer, but do not glue your items to the ceiling more than twice.
President of the House of Representatives of Immigration to the Netherlands
Arib, who took the highest vote in the fourth round of parliamentary elections yesterday, became the first Dutch-born migrant president.
Arib, who also has Fas nationality, will carry out this task until 2017.
Arib was also nominated for president in 2012, but was not elected to the House of Representatives since 1998.

The latest offer came from Eski<0xC5><0x9F>ehirspor to Hope Cloud, who was not at peace with G.SARAY supporters and suffered from the protests of the tribunes in recent matches.
He missed this position, he wanted to get out of the game!
During Ryan Donk's transfer period, Eski<0xC5><0x9F>ehirspor took the final step for the national goalkeeper whom Kas<0xC4><0xB1>mpash<0xC4><0xB1> wanted to join.
However, the red blacks were answered negatively by the G.Saray administration.
Her heart stopped while she was beautiful.
The mother of two children living in RIO DA JANEIRO, Raquel Santos, 28, on Monday, asked her aesthetician to remove traces of laughter from the mouth edges.
The woman who was injected with the filling material in her face was accelerated to take heartbeat and breathe after a while.
Afterwards, his heart stopped, and he lost his life.
Police are investigating whether the woman has a role in the death of a drug called Potenay, which she uses daily.
The real cause of death will be known after the autopsy.
In a statement to the Brazilian press, Deborah Azevedo, the model’s closest friend, said Santos was obsessed with aesthetic surgery, with seven other 13-year-old sons.
Santos was second among Brazil’s most important beauty competitions to Musa do Brasil in December.
Oil companies have officially collapsed.
Since 2014, when oil prices began to fall, nearly <0x24>400 billion of investment was delayed until the end of last year, the most deep sea (deepwater) oil exploration projects were suspended.
According to research by consulting company Wood Mackenzie, while low oil and gas prices led to the <0x24>380 billion project being suspended, millions of barrels were produced in a wide geography from the Gulf of Mexico to Africa.
As the main reason for the cost cuts was at <0x24>115 in the summer of 2014, the report, which showed a loss of 70 per cent in the year to its lowest oil price in the 12-year period, stated that “the company’s budgets have drastically reduced.”
400 MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSKIDA
When crude oil prices made new surprises every day, the last time we saw the lowest level of the last 12 years, it fell below <0x24>30.
"Will oil fall to <0x24>15"; "Is oil now cheaper than water" debates are on fire today, a research published by energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie reveals how the industry is affected by falling prices.
Wood Mackenzie, who recently published a report in July, found that falling oil prices led to the suspension of <0x24>200 billion in 46 major energy investments, reveals where the figure reached by the end of 2015.
According to the report, 22 major projects have been postponed in the last six months of 2015, with a total of 68 major projects suspended since the start of the oil spill in 2014.
The value of these projects is about <0x24>400 billion.
DAILY 2.9 MILLION VARIAL
The study stressed that the impact of low oil prices on company plans was "sharp", and that the most affected projects were deep sea development projects.
While projects have been suspended for a total of 27 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent, 2.9 million barrels of petroleum per day are deferred by 2025.
According to the research, while the final investment decision of most of the projects in question was postponed to 2017 and beyond, the first production targets were also recorded between 2020 and 2023.
Among the 68 projects delayed, the report highlighted a potential <0x24>170 billion investment expected to be made over the next five years, "the majority of <0x24>170 billion deep sea projects."
This is because the cost of pre-investment is too high.
“70% of the sea’s marine spending is primarily made up of oil-weighted projects in Nigeria, Angola and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico,” it said.
According to the research, the countries with the most deferred oil project inventories are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries have nearly 90 percent of the deferred liquid (petroleum) reserves.
Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia, the countries with the highest amounts of depleted gas reserves, make up 85 percent of the total.
While most of the natural gas awaiting its release here is located in the deep sea, it requires complex and costly development solutions such as installing a zero-liquid natural gas (LNG) plant.
While the companies that are most at risk are oil giants, with commitments to follow each other in the deep sea, the oil sands of Canada and the Hazar Region, the companies are also said to be trying to adapt to the "longer-lower" oil price scenario.
Eyes in Iran
There was a table about four years ago: the U.S. and Europe had shipped to Iran’s oil to halt Tehran’s nuclear program, the price of oil was about <0x24>110, and how Iran’s oil exports could be reduced without causing a sudden jump in prices.
When we come back this week, we see a different scenario.
Petroleum prices have seen gold at <0x24>30 for the first time since 2004, the main reason for this was the explosion in U.S. production, and embargoes on Iran are rising.
That's why the eyes are on Iran.
If Iran increases its oil exports, more oil will flow into the oil market, which is already said to be quite saturated.
This could lead us to fall below the levels that we are surprised at today’s prices.
Some analysts say that Saudi Arabia, which does not want to raise market share to Iran, will pump more oil and could have a price war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
As the actions do not rise, Iran’s main target is Asia’s fast-growing oil market as its former partners in India and Europe.
The Iranian authorities said in statements earlier, they aimed to raise 500,000 barrels a day in the first phase of exports, and then put a lot more on the market.
According to map information from Reuters, 22 very large crude oil carriers (VLCCs) are waiting in Iran, with at least 13 full or large quantities.
Iran is the world’s fourth-largest proven oil reserve.
Thanks to the exceptions made, Iran is still exporting about 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries where Turkey is also located.
Prior to the attacks, Iran’s daily exports of oil were up to 3 million barrels per day.
Aysun Göksu, a research expert, responds to the question of whether oil will fall below <0x24>20: “China’s centralized global growth concerns are increasing the downward pressure on foreign prices while deepening the loss in oil prices.”
We see that China, the world’s largest oil importer, has reached 20 percent since Christmas, with concerns about the reduction of oil demand in parallel with the economic slowdown.
In addition, we can witness prices below <0x24>30 in oil in the coming days due to the global value gains and the impact of the global surplus of oil problem.
Unless we see permanent prices above the <0x24>32-33 levels, the upward movement in petroleum may be limited and downward pressure may increase.
At this point, it can be said that closures below the critical <0x24>30 level play a key role in keeping the declines going.
In such a case, it should not be surprising that the reliefs lasting up to the 23.30-25.60 support area at the bottom should be seen.
Isham Sardouk: "The Age of Angels is over!"
Why did you turn the route to Turkey when you took on the task of trend creativity at Victoria's Secret and WGSN, which determines the world's fashion trends?
- I'm always on the side of change.
I was born in Paris, I lived in London, then I went to New York.
I have also held important positions there.
Meanwhile, for the last two years, I've started advising Koton.
And then I saw the potential in this geography and the Coton brand.
I realized that everything was needed to be a chain of stores in the world.
Now I'm here to make it happen.
Will you be able to succeed in a short time?
- Absolutely.
Although it is already a young brand, it is currently sold in 50 countries.
We produce 50 collections a year, we have 15 separate sections.
So there's everything a store chain needs to have.
From Dubai to Moscow, we can meet the needs of consumers in different geographies.
We are now opening a store in Paris in March, and this is the beginning of a new and exciting season...
Do you have to open a store in Paris?
- Yes, sir.
It's not because Europe's economic situation is great.
But you open some stores for the picture.
Paris is in the fashion capitals like London, and you earn money from the Middle East.
One gives prestige to the brand, the other gives money, both of which are necessary for a brand that plays a role in globalism.
Let's talk about trends...
- We have a very romantic, stylish season ahead of us.
Flying chiffon dresses, soft tones, pink, white, red.
Patterns...
We are going through very difficult and cruel times, and the fashion world is always trying to add a sense of happiness to life by carrying stylish, intriguing designs to the pod during these difficult times.
That's what we're doing.
That's why the new season is coming back in the "Beautiful Age".
Let's go back to your years in Victoria's Secret.
Who was the most legendary angel?
I’m not just talking about her amazing physics: so positive, so good a girl!
They sat next to me while I was working and they fed me with apples and said, "My lady, are you hungry?"
He was so cute.
And you know what I'm talking about, and I figured you interviewed all Victoria's Secret models.
Karolina was beautiful, wasn't she?
But Adriana Lima was also very impressed with her beauty.
- Yes, yes, that sounds!
That speech, that tone...
After a while, you come back and say, "Sit on one side and look nice, don't do anything else!"
It's annoying.
That's right, that's the kind of shock.
I interviewed Candice Swanepoel.
She was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, but I was horrified by her emptiness.
- Most of them are now.
The new angels are not like the old ones.
I remember Gisele's time.
It was hard to work with him, though.
He came to the tower and smoked like a cigarette.
Not because it's Tiryaki.
No one drinks, only he can drink!
The goal is to make a diva.
The Victoria's Secret parade, released two months ago, received the lowest rating in its history.
Why do you think?
- Like I said, the age of beautiful angels is over.
Who's going to do Gigi Hadid?
What's nice?
Kendall Jenner, like a throne...
No bends, nothing.
Kate Moss's curves are also zero, but it has become the biggest name of the fashion industry.
- Yeah, but how beautiful her face was.
I want to exercise my right of objection here.
Last year, I interviewed him, and his face collapsed.
- So much tobacco, tobacco, now it's ugly, of course.
But in the nineties, she had such a beautiful face.
Her lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
He grew up at the end of that supermodel era.
Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington...
Christy was my neighbor, and I saw her makeupless every morning.
Such a state of beauty, such a grace, cannot be.
What about Delevingne?
- He's hurting himself.
They don’t take part in every campaign.
Tired people.
There's no hunger for celebrity models, like the old ones.
People like themselves want to see real faces in campaigns.
We're going to go over it.
Because that's the trend.
25 Letters from Turkey
According to BBC Türkçe, the authors who are among the presidents of the International Writers’ Union (PEN) in the UK, Wales and Scotland are among them; in Turkey, a significant part of the life of threats and physical attacks that target colleagues, journalists and publishers.
The two attacks targeting the Hürriyet newspaper in the letter in Turkey, including the pressure from the Koza group and the detention of Vice News journalists, and investigations and arrests of journalists, have been considered as worrying developments.
My mother had half the right to work.
Turk-<0xC4><0xB0><0xC5><0x9F> "We think that mothers are given half the right to work so that rent labour can be reintroduced."
"This could be a trojan horse," TISK said, "we are worried that this arrangement will prevent women from working in the interests of women."
The new rights, which are planned to be brought to employees of officials and working women after childbirth or adoption, passed through the commission with full-day meetings.
The most common topic on the agenda of 6 months postpartum half-time or free work permits was "permanent labor" in commission meetings, which allowed the child to go to primary school.
CHP <0xC4><0xB0>zmir MEP Musa <0xC3><0x87>am, who stated that the partial study was correct until the child went to primary school, said, "If you bring the lease labour arrangement behind it, we will be in front of it until the end."
Enis Baghdadio<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who participated in the meetings on behalf of Turk-Ish, said, while expressing similar concerns, "We have doubts as to how to fill the place of the female worker in the part-time work."
Baghdadio<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who pointed out that there will be new problems that will overtake the stone work if this part of the lease is rescheduled, said, "We will therefore watch with concern the developments regarding private employment offices."
TISK Secretary General Bülent Pirler, stating that part-time work has been done for five years under the law, "There is no such long-term part-time work in other countries."
And look at the event like this.
"In places with 1 or 2 employees, the consequences of this application should also be considered," he said.
TOBB Advisor Ahmet <0xC5><0x9E>a<0xC4><0x9F>ar said that if the application goes into effect, it would be difficult to find a worker.
<0xC5><0x9E>a<0xC4><0x9F>ar, who said there was no legislation on the rules to be applied in part-time work, said, "Agreement must be made between the worker and the employer if there is a regulation on private employment offices."
Text Feyzio<0xC4><0x9F>lu: We do not support
Feyzio<0xC4><0x9F>lu’s statement read: “We do not agree to this statement, and we are not able to participate and support it.”
Because there is no criticism of the PKK.
You couldn't say anything negative to the PKK, the separatist terrorist organization, you didn't throw dust on it.
We do not take seriously and do not find sincere, taking into account the heavy expressions that are spent on the state alone.
We are lawyers, we are lawyers.
If the representatives of the state, public officials, security forces have acted unlawfully in this context, we should follow him.
When we say, "Don't destroy the state," to those who sympathize with the partitions or partitions, they attack us as "divisor, fascist."
When we say, “This state must act in accordance with law, it must always be superior to law,” they say, “You are making divisions.”
We're the bridge.
We are always committed to telling the truth.

Who is Bergen?
His real name is Belgin Wristband, Bergen was born on July 16, 1960 in Mersin.
With the divorce of his parents, Sebahat Chaqir and his mother settled in Ankara in 1966.
After the Yenimahalle Yunus Emre Primary School, the Ankara State Conservatory entered the piano section, but he left because of financial difficulties and worked for a while at the PTT.
In 1979, he accepted the offer he received for his work after going to the Feyman Night Club, where he went to have fun with his friends.
At the Feyman Night Club, together with the Group Locomotive Orchestra, he staged with repertoires consisting of Turkish Art Music, Turkish Light Music and arrangements that were the fashion of the era.
After Ankara, Bergen went to Adana for work, where he met Halis Serbes and married a year later.
In 1982, he released the first Atlas Plate album, "I Have a Story."
Bergen, who was unable to resist her husband's violence as she continued her art life, fled her husband many times.
In October 1982, while working in Izmir, she was beaten by her husband.
Bergen, who lost one eye in the attack and burned much of his body, was convinced and brought to the stage by the composer of the song "Kimbir?", which made Kibariye famous after treatment.
Until 1985, <0xC4><0xB0>zmir P<0xC4><0xB1>rlanta, who was the owner of <0xC3><0x96>z<0xC5><0x9F>eker, produced a demo tape called "Brother's Fate" with his boss, and sent it to Ya<0xC5><0x9F>ar Kekeva.
Kekeva, who liked Bergen, invited the artist to Istanbul.
"Human Severse" was the first professional longplayer in the Istanbul music market, with the artist Burhan Bayar's "Woman of the Sorrows" making it to fame towards the end of 1986.
She was awarded with the Golden Plate and Golden Cassette award in April 1987 with the title "Album Most Satanic Arabic Woman Artist of 1986" by the record company.
In the same year, Yal<0xC4><0x8D>ín Gulhan, Asuman Arsan and Meral Niron faced the camera in the film "The Woman of the Sorrows" with the screenplay and the director of the country.
With a large crowd of fans, Bergen survived the last minute of the knife attack in Adana, where he went for a concert.
The artist, who left the stage for a while, and the great masters Selami <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, <0xC3><0x96>zer <0xC5><0x9E>enay and Cengiz Tekin, respectively, released their albums "He also burns God", "The Price of Love" and "I Don't Want".
She officially divorced her husband in April 1989, and returned to the stage in June 1989, with her last album, "Years Without Forgiveness".
The artist, who began the album's promotional tours with an intense interest, was shot dead by his wife in Adana Posanty on the night of August 14, 1989, joining August 15, 1989.
His country was named Mersin.
Bergen has a short life span of 29 years with 5 longplays and 129 songs on 11 cassettes as well as a video film.
The claim that the artist, who signed in Arabic with different and powerful voices, has become legendary has been vindicated by the first day of his death's album, "My Return to Youth."
Officially published studio albums of Bergen:
1982 - I Have a Complaint LP (1986 reprinted as MC).
1983 - Brother Destiny LP (1985 and 1990 reprinted as MC).
1985 – Human Severse LP, MC (reprinted as a CD in 1999)

Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Wisdom Ran, known as Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Sh<0xC4><0xB1>ri Mem<0xC4><0xB1>leket, was celebrated in the 114th year of his birth with the event "Good that Born Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m".
The event, organized by Konak Municipality, took place in the hall where the poet’s name was given.
The famous poet's poems, theater and film actor R<0xC5><0xAB><0xC5><0x9F>t<0xC5><0xAB><0xC5><0x9F>ti Asia, performing poetry and music performances.
In the event, he also accompanied the Asian Three Anatolian Music Community with his comments.
He liked many of the artworks of the Wisdom.

In Istanbul, an event organized by Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Wisdom Culture and Art Foundation was held.
Founding President Rutkay St. and members of the Wisdom of Nazem met in Tarabya for the event of the actress Tarik Akan, daughter of Vera Tulyakova, wife of Nazem Wisdom.
“Living alone like a tree and breeding/And to your sister-in-law like a forest” will read poems and leave turtles to the sea.
The event, organized with the contributions of the Municipality of Jar<0xC3><0xAC>yer, will be accompanied by the songs of Nâzem Wisdom Chorus.
Wisdom was born on January 15, 1902.
World-famous poet Nazim Wisdom's poems have been translated into more than 50 languages.
He has been repeatedly detained for political reasons and spent most of his adult life in prison or exile.
His poems have been translated into more than fifty languages and his works have received many awards.
He died on June 3, 1963.
The municipality of Bursa Nilüfer has done special works on the 114th birthday of the world famous poet Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Hikmet.
For the first time in the history of Turkey, the municipality, which worked for the documentary "Bursa's Nazm<0xC4><0xB1>" which describes the days of 11-year-old Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m in Bursa Prison, also raised personal money for the poet.
Thus, in cooperation with the PTT, the first personal money was withdrawn on behalf of Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Hikmet in the history of Turkey.
The price of this special cash and first day envelopes, 1.40 TL, will be given to guests on the night of Thursday 14 January at Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Wisdom Culture.
They will be removed by bicycle.
However, because of the lack of agreement between the two countries, most Syrian refugees will have to return to Russia, this time by turning the pedal at least 20 degrees.
In the summer months, as it was safer and cheaper, a group of refugees travelled by plane to Russia and passed from there to the north of the country from Murmansk to Norway.
As the agreement between the two countries did not allow migrants to cross the border, they crossed the border by bicycle.
Norway has now decided to send these refugees back.
For this reason, the Norwegian security commissioned the repair of bicycles abandoned after crossing the border.
Crisis of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion to Turkey in the EU
Turkey is facing a crisis of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion committed to refugees.
European Union Commission President Jean Claude Juncker has criticized Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi for blocking funds to be transferred to Turkey.
Juncker pointed out that the spirit between Italy and the rest of Europe was not good, stressed that the EU had to find 3 billion euros.
Juncker said: "This money is not for Turkey, it is for Syrian refugees in Turkey."
We haven't reached <0x24>3 billion yet.
“It’s a matter of EU credibility, and that’s why it’s important,” he said.
Juncker said he expects the money to be completed by January 26, the date previously given.
When it comes to Turkey, Italy is one of the countries that has a positive attitude.
Diplomatic sources believe that Rome’s position on the financial package is not a direct move towards Turkey and is linked to problems between Italy and the EU Commission and some union countries.
There has been tensions between Italy and the EU for a while.
At the last EU summit on energy, banking and immigrants, Renzi continued to criticize German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and the EU in a harsh language.
In a press conference yesterday, Juncker criticised Renzi's attitude, "Renzi should stop blaming the EU."
"It is wrong for Renzi, who I love her so much, to humiliate the EU Commission on every occasion," he said.
Juncker meant that Renzi was playing for the inner public.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion promised to Turkey will be paid out of the 1 billion EU budget.
Two billion euros will come from the budgets of the Member States.
Germany will contribute at least <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>427 million.
It was decided that the Romanian Administration, which for political reasons said it would not transfer money to Turkey, would transfer the EUR 2.3 million in interest to the EU budget for support to Jordan and Lebanon.
The source is expected to be used in the period 2016-2017.
When I saw Charlie Hebdo's cartoon, I cried.
Father Abdullah Kurdi, who spoke to the Russian official news agency Sputnik, reacted harshly and said, "If you want the truth, I have cried for this cartoon."
"I felt so bad," he said.
Following the armed attack, his father Kurdi, who became a symbol of freedom of expression, said he expected positive things from Charlie Hebdo, a French smuggler magazine.
Unfortunately, they made a bad cartoon.
Everyone was very sad about this cartoon.
Aylan, a 2-year-old boy, died.
Aylan, me and my family had to respect Charlie Hebdo, but it was the opposite.
This magazine should show respect to the dead children.
The Prophet published a disrespectful cartoon about our Lord.
They also made publications about God.
It is a small thing that has been done to my child in the presence of Allah and the Prophet.
Kurdi, who lives in Erbil, made the call: "I call on all the world and the magazine of kindness, everyone should respect all the children who died."
They should not grieve their families for their pain.
Aylan Kurdi's still living in Canada, Tima Kurdi, was also the one who reacted to cartoons.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau has the impression that when 3-year-old Syrian Aylan Kurdi was raised to shoot a dead body on the coast of Bodrum in a signed cartoon, he could be 'one of the perpetrators in Germany'.
Last year, Hz. Muhammad published cartoons, and the French charity magazine Charlie Hebdo, which was attacked by radical religious leaders killing 12 people, was once again the subject of controversy because of the caricature of Aylan Kurdi.
In the cartoon, early in the German city of Cologne, as in the women’s harassment that took place during Christmas celebrations, there were no photographs of pork faces chasing women and calling on immigrants.
The cartoon that causes different reactions on social media is actually part of a 4-square-column.
On the column he writes "This is not France" and, according to many readings, he criticizes the growing hostility of refugees along with other values lost to France.
On the other hand, the cartoon still led to many people accusing Charlie Hebdo of racism.
In a number published last year, Charlie Hebdo magazine criticized France's reluctant attitude to open its doors to migrants, while overcoming Germany, which has admitted to receiving 800,000 refugees.
The cartoon reads, “He was very close to the machine,” while the advertisement reads, “Two children’s menus for a price.”
'Autopsy of Germans killed in Sultanahmet' in Germany'
According to the weekly Der Spiegel website, the German Federal Prosecutor’s Office has decided that 10 of the people who lost their lives in the attack will be brought to Germany.
The funerals of the deceased will be held today or tomorrow at the country and airport by a plane belonging to the German Air Force.
In Germany, experts from the Federal Criminal Department (BKA), which performs forensic medical procedures, go there to identify and autopsy for German nationals who die in accidents or attacks under normal conditions.
But Der Spiegel magazine wrote that this time the situation would be different.
According to the magazine, officials from the Federal Criminal Department have applied to Turkish authorities for the identity detection and autopsy of the deceased in Istanbul, but Turkish authorities have not accepted the proposal.
The Federal Criminal Department had sent four experts to Istanbul following the attack in Istanbul.
Seven German tourists wounded in the attack are being treated at the hospital.
Ellen Meiksen Wood has lost her life.
Meiksins Wood, a renowned political theorist and socialist historian, was particularly interested in his important work on the origins of capitalism.
Meiksins Wood of Latvia, born in New York in 1942, also published in Turkish: Escape from Class -- The Back Culture of Capitalism -- Capitalism Against Democracy -- The Origin of Capitalism -- The Capitalist Empire -- The Return to Marx
Swimming pool for asylum-seekers
The news in the German press says that if the message of the ban of social workers in the country is reported to be understood by the refugees, the municipality will be lifted.
In a statement to the WDR, Markus Schnapka, a social worker who recorded that the municipality did not want to punish the innocents because of the behaviour of several people, said that the rest of the countries were informed in three languages about the values of importance in Germany.
Schnapka, who recorded Germany’s controversial value for gender equality, added that the municipality would punish all kinds of attacks and harassment.
On the other hand, the carnival in Rheinberg was cancelled due to the possibility of occurrence in the upcoming carnival passages of harassment scandals in Cologne.
The mayor announced that the carnival was cancelled because there was no guarantee that the incidents of harassment would not happen.
What are the Benefits of Cooking in Steam?
The technique of steaming, which is a technique that does not kill vitamins and minerals in nutrients, is becoming increasingly popular.
For centuries, cooking in steam, one of the most preferred cooking techniques in the Far East, makes metabolism strong and facilitates digestion.
In this method, which completely eliminates problems such as malnutrition, bacteria and microbes inside the nutrients also die completely.
Ingredients such as protein, cellulose and starch in the diet dissolve completely with this technique, which makes the food softer.
Cooking in low-pressure steam; steaming cups or steaming machine is carried out in the pot.
In high-pressure cooking, the amount of water used and the cooking time is low.
This can be illustrated as the best example of cooking in a drizzled bowl.
To cook foods such as vegetables, especially on diet menus, it is necessary to wash the vegetables thoroughly first and then to wait for them to be thoroughly rinsed by placing them in the refrigerator.
A deep bowl is filled with water in a third proportion and is placed in the steam cooler bowl.
The mouth of the bowl is left half-closed.
This ensures that the steam comes out of the oven comfortably.
The generating fire is first brought to the highest level by providing water boiling, then the generating fire is brought to a lower level by obtaining a constant heat.
Vegetables and nutrients, cooked in the steamer for about 10 - 15 minutes, are controlled with the help of oats after cooking well.
Baked vegetables are taken from the pan and placed on plates served.
In the steaming cooking technique, the appearance, color and smell of the food does not change, so this method is healthy.
The taste of your food remains the same.
So the quality and taste of your food will not be compromised.
At the same time, in steam cooking, which is one of the most economical methods of cooking, nutritional loss is kept at the lowest level.
The vegetables cooked in the steamer also offer a satisfying holiday to eat with a more vibrant and lively appearance.
This method, which is often used in diet meals, is also often preferred because it is mild.
David Bowie - Blackstar: the alien's "last" album
To know you're going to die; to make that last album without telling anyone about it, to turn the death bed into an artistic expression space in the clip you're shooting...
Things like this; we may appear too "in the corner" for worldly fans.
I call them worldly fans because I am among those who sincerely believe that the man who did this is both immortal and alien.
He had come to our Earth from another corner of the universe; now he has returned to his homeland; this is what happened.
It came because it was only Kiss, Marilyn Manson, or Lady Gaga that had to be inspired by all the artists of the world.
He completed his assignment with merit.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes Price: 9.99 TL 5/5
He was probably fed from Warhol, Kubrick, the same planet as him.
When Apollo 11 landed on the Moon, he decided to say, "I'm an alien too," and he confused us by saying, "Space Oddity."
He didn’t really get involved; he always took a few steps ahead.
A lot of people have found ways to lose thanks to him.
Musicians and listeners...
If we're going to put aside his interest in plastic arts, his acting, or anything else, it's unfair to say "just music" for music.
The characters that go from song to song and they create themselves; their sending, their innovation, their taboo-virality, their discography expresses an artistic integrity for me.
I can't call him the father of glam rock, or the cousin of punk.
So, what about that vanguard electronic movement that he's been hiding in love since he was a kid?
David Bowie reminded us of the meaning of the word "icon" in our mouths until the years when we kept the word "icon" in our mouth.
It wasn’t a man, it wasn’t a woman, it wasn’t a man.
It was a body.
He appeared to us for a while for a mission.
He left the world two days after the release of his 26th studio album "Blackstar".
"Blackstar" and "Lazarus" that we listened to before the album was released tried to train us to go.
We were thinking, "He's old now, he's talking about death, etc." He was aware of everything.
One more game...
The album was released a long time ago, except for "Blackstar" and "Lazarus", which backed the message and emotion of the album, but was re-recorded for the album with "Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime)" and "Tis A Pity She Was A Whore".
I would like to say that "Girl Loves Me", "I Can't Give Everything Away" and "Dollar Days" are also very good songs.
"Blackstar" is based on a very powerful musical structure, but it's so intriguing, it's made with instant sensations...
Neither death nor an album "calculated with the past"...
It's just a real "last" album.
"The End" is the title of a music life from beginning to end.
Turkey targeted in Sultanahmet attack
The head of the German Federal Security Department, Holger Münch, said in a program that participated in the first German channel ARD on Tuesday in Sultanahmet Square that killed 10 German citizens.
Münch said the target of the attack was not German citizens, but Turkey.
“I have 400 people in my eyes.”
But Munich, stating that the Sultanahmet attack did not change the threat of terrorism in Germany, said, "We are still under a threat that needs to be taken seriously."
Münch pointed out that the number of people who went to Syria to join ISIS from Germany had decreased, while many returned from war zones.
Münch, who said this was a major challenge for security units, said, "There are almost 400 dangerous people that we should not be under surveillance right now."
Münch has called for better coordination between police agencies in Europe and to be in closer contact.
Turkish officials said the live bomb was a Syrian citizen and a member of ISIS, while German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière said the identity of the attacker had not yet been identified.
Sezen Aksu says goodbye to the scenes
Sezen Aksu, who decorated his 40th anniversary with a concert series, enchanted his fans with the "Sezen Years" concert he gave at the Volkswagen Arena last night.
The first episode of the concert series, which took place in July, also took place at the Volkswagen Arena on 15-16 January.
At the concert, Aksu took all his listeners on a 40-year journey from yesterday to today.
In addition to the love songs that touched our personal lives, Aksu also sang songs about social issues that are of close interest to our country and our world.
After the concerts he promised, Aksu, who said he would say goodbye to the stage life, was upset by his fans.
In the concert "Sezen Aksu" appeared with a separate story for those who loved filling the Volkswagen Arena in each piece.
Each story, show, light, and stage show took viewers to different eras.
In the final part of the unforgettable concert, there was also a video show where the Istanbul paintings of Revolution Erbil took place.
Aksu also hosted them to the stage for the first time, featuring videos that his fans had previously recorded on the stage.
In Ankara and Istanbul, 25 pounds of bread has arrived
In Ankara, as of yesterday, 250 grams of bread was sold for 25 pounds, starting from 1 TL.
New years ago, especially in December, there were statements by the Minister of Food, Agriculture and Livestock, Minister of Customs and Commerce, Faruk Tüfenkci, in the form of "No Time".
However, in the capital Ankara, 250 grams of bread was sold for 1 TL yesterday.
Hail Ibrahim Balc<0xC4><0xB1>, President of the Turkish Bakery Federation, said of the 25-kilograms of the bread, "It was not time, the tariff decision of 2 years ago began to apply" and added:
"This was a tariff decision taken two years ago."
The Chamber of Commerce Association set this tariff two years ago.
A price applied throughout Turkey.
So a new zam application was made and it did not go up the price.
But because of the competition, he was selling snails in some parts of Ankara for <0xC2><0xA3>75.
In some areas, it was already sold for 1 TL.
He didn't lower the price of the snail, who relied on his bread, because of the competition, they had to apply 1 TL.
There's no increase or loss.
They're applying unpaid prices.
“In the first half of 2016, the price of a kilogram of bread will definitely not exceed 5 TL and we will complete the year with this price if we don’t have a very big problem.”
In some parts of Istanbul, bread began to be sold for 1.25 TL.
This time, Burkina Faso was killed.
In Burkina Faso, West Africa, 23 people from 18 different countries were killed in the attack on a luxury hotel targeted by foreigners and United Nations officials.
The attack was carried out by the North African arm of Al-Qaeda.
The attack in Burkina Faso took place four days after the terrorist attack in Cakarta, the world’s most populous Muslim country, by ISIS with 250 million people.
The operation of foreign embassies, luxury hotels and shops on a street where there are shops at the Starbucks branch and police station during the daytime bombed and armed attacks; a Canadian and an Indonesian life.
Indonesian officials said the attackers were inspired by the Paris massacre of November 13.
British BBC security reporter Frank Garner also pointed out that this action has been part of a frightening trend that has been shown in many cities around the world lately.
The U.S. also died shortly before the terrorist attacks.
In early December, 14 people were killed in an armed attack by a pair of ISIS sympathizers in San Bernardino, California, in the United States.
"San Bernardino" attack on the United States
Following the live bombing of 10 German tourists killed in Sultanahmet, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière recalled that there were terrorist attacks in many parts of the world, "we had two major attacks in Paris."
If we say that, then terror has won...
We used the phrase "until we step back."
ISIS has left Whatsapp talking to Alrawi app
According to a new report, the terrorist organization is using its own chat tool to communicate independently of chat apps such as ISIS, WhatsApp and Telegram.
According to the Defense One report, the organization is taking advantage of a new messaging app to communicate with one another.
This Android app called "Alrawi" is distributed and installed via an APK file.
The application allows the organization to messaging encrypted between itself and share media.
Flash movement from ISIS in Iraq
The functionality of the app remains "preferable" to popular apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, according to the Ghost Security Group.
It is not yet known how powerful the encryption used is.
ISIS had previously carried out its entire communication via the Telegram app, which allows it to send messages via an encrypted link.
But Telegram had revealed the channels ISIS members spoke to.
In addition, the U.S. administration is urging app developers to place backdoors to their apps.
That’s why the organization is now beginning to use its own solutions instead of relying on WhatsApp and Telegram’s encryption.

How should the Semester holiday be evaluated?
How should students evaluate the half-year holiday? we asked the education specialist-student coach Murat Ayd<0xC4><0xB1>n.
For half-year holiday students only; it should not be considered to spend time at the beginning of relaxation, entertainment, television and computer.
The semester holiday is a very important opportunity to prepare for the new period of education and review the past period.
The so-called half-year holiday is also an important opportunity for personal development, knowledge, skills and hobby.
Make a half-assessment list.
Write down everything you plan to do and try to apply it.
Make sure you enjoy it and you will have a very productive period of semester.
Now let's talk about how a productive semester period should be for students who are preparing YGS-LYS in the first place.
Because the questions that come to us the most from friends who are preparing for the YGS-LYS exams are: "How should we evaluate this period, whether we need to solve a lot of questions or whether we have missing issues to deal with them?"
Let’s start by writing to our friends who are preparing for the exam first, in order to respond to them and spend a productive period.
While the exam preparation process should be a process starting from the 9th grade under normal conditions, we try to complete it more within the last 1 year, which for us makes us spend the last year more efficiently, efficiently and more accurately using the time.
In addition to the final class student’s exam preparation, the school also has to conduct written studies together.
Even though the graduate student has entered the exam (YGS-LYS) at least once and has experienced it, the year that the graduate will prepare for the re-examination as a student is also critically important for him.
Because most graduates and their family see the year ‘O’ as their last chance, which causes even greater stress.
Studying the lesson is the work that the student does not enjoy, just because he feels obligated to do, and therefore is usually the work that he always ends up doing, but for the students who do it regularly, it has become a complete task for them, and when it comes to what the plan involves.
Now we have a half-year holiday ahead of us, and we need to assess this in the best way.
For this, we must have a plan that will allow us to manage our time well.
Studying in the semester holidays:
First of all, everyone should make a plan that suits their own situation.
1.My decision should plan for what was resolved, what was lacking; the day, week and 15 days.
During this period, the issue must be repeated and there must be questions solutions.
At the same time, students who lack not much can also pass an average of 1-2 exams.
Halledin: Research shows that 75 percent of what people learn in a week, 66 percent in a day, and 54 percent in an hour.
The best and most effective way to eliminate forgetfulness is by repeating it.
Students who make a lot of mistakes in the past, in particular, should focus on their overall re-work.
Identify your missing topics first and plan the day, place the topic every day, and make sure you handle them.
This planning will relax you both academically and psychologically.
Keep in mind that the most mistakes you make when putting them into your plan.
Because you won’t have such a long holiday period in the future.
Make Problem Solving Solutions:
It’s important to solve the question as much as repeating it.
Because we can see how much we understand the work we do, but only through the turns that we receive through the question we solve.
Don’t forget to set a certain number of questions each day.
The number of questions you’ll solve may vary depending on the work you’ll do that day; you may not solve too many questions on a day when you’re doing heavy work, but still we should not work to a certain extent to see how much we’ve learned that day.
Solve Testing Exams:
Another study you will do on a six-year vacation should be to pass the exams.
Even though all of the subjects are not complete, you can at least make coursework exam solutions.
Let’s say you’ve done a lot of Turkish lessons; you can solve 40-questioned Turkish lessons.
And be sure to make it work while doing this.
If you can solve 40 Turkish questions in the first 60 minutes, then your next goal can be solved in a few minutes less.
Holidays and Hobbies:
Holidays, of course, are not just about learning; you also need to spend a few days on vacation, rest and hobbies.
It will only prevent you from unloading and resting during a holiday period that will be spent by studying.
Therefore, there should also be special times in your plans for yourself.
Reading a book, watching TV, surfing the internet can be part of your plans, most importantly, how much time you’ll spend.
I'm going to have a little advice for friends who say I haven't spent the first period productively.
If; my first season didn’t go very well, I didn’t work very hard and if you say my shortcomings too much this half-year holiday is also a great opportunity for you.
But first of all, you have to decide and believe it.
In the Turkish football super league, the goals were scored between the 76th and 90th minutes in the 2009-2010 season.
Now you answer the question you asked yourself, is the match over and you are going to the dressing room, or the match is still going on and there are too many minutes to score?
I don’t think anyone wants to say, “We’ll look at the upcoming matches now, which is a defeated football team coach or a classic commentary used by his players.”
All you have to do now is leave the past and look ahead, not run.
If we're going to collect what we're saying:
1) First, make a half-year vacation plan,
2) Repeat by going through the topics you know,
3) Take care of your missing topics,
4) Solve the issues by solving the question,
5) Solve the test exams,
6) Read the book.
7) Set new goals for the new period,
8) Take time for yourself, your hobbies, and what you enjoy.
9) Take time with your family and friends,
10) Spend time with social and cultural activities (cinema, sports, theatre, concerts, trips, picnics, etc.)
"Kervan" is a long way off.
Kervan’s founder, Shinasi Demirel, one of Turkey’s largest ‘home’ store chains, and his son Hasan, joined Kervan’s home Sweet Home, with an average of 45 stores covering 1,000 square meters, with 17 stores abroad and 25 stores in the country.
With the recent completion of trade registration operations, Kervan also owned 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad.
Shinasi Demirel, who says there is no Kervan store yet abroad, said, "Now we will continue to shop smaller with the big store Kervan, with Home Sweet Home."
"Kervan will also be opened abroad," he said.
The merger of Kervan’s <0xC2><0xA3>140 million cirrhosis with Home Sweet Home, which amounted to <0xC2><0xA3>50 million in 2015, led to the emergence of a retail chain of <0xC2><0xA3>140 million in production.
The total sales area of Kervan, which has 45 caves in 35 years, is 45,000 square meters.
25 of the stores belong to the main company.
There are about 500 jobs in Kervan.
Home Sweet Home has 17 stores overseas in 25 countries, with a total sales area of 6,500 square meters and a workforce of 320 people.
Kadir Kalayc<0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu, Chairman of the Board of Directors, who produces, exports and shops with partner Flame Pakten, said that they were very pleased with the merger with Kervan, "We are Mardinliyys and we entered this sector in 1998."
From the beginning, we created a brand with the support of the Shinasi Gentlemen.
It's the 'TRT' of this sector.
We learned a lot from him.
We even started our first step to the store by giving us his own Ak Centrez store.
Kervan and I were already working as a strategic partner, not as a competitor.
"Now there will be a very serious synergy with this merger," he said.
Kalayc<0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu has announced that Home Sweet Home now has 17 stores abroad, including the weight of it in the Middle East, and that they are also starting to export to China last month.
He said, "We also opened our first horn in Shanghai."
We've negotiated with a chain of 200 stores.
“After that, we will also develop large stores abroad as Kervan, small stores with Home Sweet Home,” he said.
Poroshenko sells its factory in Russia
Roshen CEO Vyacheslav Moskalevsky, who interviewed Liga.net, said the factory was sold for <0x24>200 million.
Moskalevsky said, "Yeah, we got the factory for sale."
"Although it does not sell, all the real buyers have disappeared suddenly," he said, noting that there was no buyer.
Regarding the price of the company's factory in the Russian city of Lipetsk, Moskalevsky said, "We have set it as about <0x24>200 million."
Roshen, who produces 450,000 tons of chocolate and sugar a year, is one of the world’s largest producers and belongs to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.
Star Holding Became Pladis Abroad
Star Holding merged global companies operating in the biscuit and chocolate sectors it acquired under the name "Pladis".
With the merger of De Met’s, Godiva, United Biscuits and Länder brands, a <0x24>5.2 billion new food giant was born, employing 26,000 people.
Murat <0xC3><0x9C>lker, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Star Holding, who spoke at the meeting on merger of global companies under Star Holding, said, "Being a global company was our goal from the very beginning," adding:

“When we look back at the possibilities in our family, we want to focus on our main business and be global in this field; we want to reorganize and reorganize the moment when we look back at the possibilities we have in our family,” says All Star Holding.
The life story of Sabri Bey, the father of the country
We re-evaluate our company, we reorganize.
We divided the world into regions.
And we shared these areas with our CEOs.
Mehmet, Muhammad and Jeff will be our district CEOs.
Mehmet T<0xC4><0xB1>t<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>c<0xC4><0xB1> is responsible for Turkey’s Middle East, K.A. and Turkish Republics.
Mohamed Elsarky is a member of our global Godiva business as well as of the Americas and Japan.
Jeff van der Eems will be responsible for Britain, Continental Europe and Africa.
While Ali <0xC3><0x9C>lker is a quality and innovation guru in his field, Cem Karaka<0xC5><0x9F> will help me manage the business.
China, Russia will be the regions that we will build and develop, in part Southeast Asia.
Murat sold shares in SAF <0xC3><0x9C>lker GYO
"We promise happiness to the whole world in every bite," Murat <0xC3><0x84>lker insists, "Our global company we set up to achieve this is Pladis."
"Wherever you say you invented the platform, that name actually has no particular meaning," he added.
The Aztecs call it Maya.
Japanese Subaru, Pervin in Iran.
In Arabic, we were inspired by the name of the team star Pleiades, which is made up of seven Latin stars that came to the mind of the nations.
I mean, we've translated the country globally.
Ali <0xC3><0x9C>lker, Vice-President of the Steering Board of Star Holding, in collaboration with laboratories in different countries, stressed that "we have begun to create synergies in innovation" and added:
We have very valuable R&D teams, and by bringing these teams together, we have achieved certain synergies in our studies on an R&D platform so far.
We have 27 R&D centers under Pladis.
The largest of these are in Turkey and England.
More than 300 of our AR-GE specialists work here.
The synergy has already begun to produce results.
The draught of Digestives, which is manufactured in the country and will begin exporting to the UK, is produced in Silyvri at the country's chocolate factory (Nibbles).
Another synergy example: Brands are different but the products are the same Countries Krispi Tr<0xC4><0xB1>k<0xC4><0xB1>k.
By adapting Jacob’s Crinklys product, a cracker technology developed in the UK, we soon brought a beautiful taste to our country under the name of Krispi Tr<0xC4><0xB1><0xC4><0x8D><0xC4><0xB1>kl<0xC4><0xB1>.
Laviva, which we all know about, met with consumers in America today.
Call of Duty Series exceeds <0x24>250 million
This series, where Activision, Infinity Ward, Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games dig their name in gold letters, seems to be unforgettable for years to come.
The newly announced sales figures are also very proof of how legendary we need to find.
Activision, which holds the series' license rights, showed 250 million copies of the number of sales it shared privately by the end of the year.
The company, which shared the total number of sales of the series at the beginning of last year, has since sold 75 million Call of Duty games.
And a lot of that is true of Black Ops 3, we’re not mistaken.
Kemal K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC4><0x9F>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu was once again elected President
Kemal K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaroglu was re-elected as President.
K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who played 990 of the 238 delegates who voted, was the re-elected president.
Of the votes cast, 248 were voting invalid.
After the announcement of the result, the parties were in a show of joy.
The CHP had a total of 275 delegates.
The council completed its work to meet at 10 a.m. on Sunday.
He said, summarizing it on the board of the Swordsman:
We wanted the games to be played here, the Turks to be said.
But the point we're coming here isn't an opening.
There is an unmanageable reality in Turkey.
The atmosphere that is created is shadowing all of this.
The reason for the Karamsar painting is those who govern the country.
As the CHPs, wherever terror comes from, whatever it comes from, we're against it.
Terrorism is a crime of humanity, and terrorists should never be forgiven.
The fight against terrorism is done with the mind, it is done with information, it is done with irony.
Of course, let's fight, we don't want anyone's nose to bleed.
What is the difference between photos in Syria, photos in Lebanon, photos in the Southeast?
When they were sitting at the table, they made serious mistakes.
It is the blood, the tears, the power of all the dead.
In 2002, they surrendered the country with zero terrorism, and today there is a Turkey that turns into a blood lake.
Who's responsible for this?
Is the taxi driver in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r our Shehz?
What does Turkey pay for?
We will be sincerely attending meetings about the change in the laws of the heartbeat, and we will convey our thoughts.
We will not allow a country to be built on anyone’s personal views.
I'm saying, "Let's change the spirit of the striker."
In the morning, their houses are being printed and detained because they have explained the country's clear thoughts.
We also have aspects that we don’t participate in, but people should be able to express their thoughts freely.
This dictator’s disorder says, “the one who eats the bread of the state and takes hostility against the state.”
I also want to ask him, why didn’t they think when they ate the bread of the state and took advantage of all the possibilities of the state?
CHP is the party that brings the biggest change to this country.
We will always prepare for the fourth big revolution together.
Whatever the cost, we will definitely bring freedom-based democracy to this country.
They can arrest us, they can arrest us, whatever they do, no matter what the cost, CHP will bring freedom to this country.
I'm making a clear call to you, Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu.
Don't hide behind the law of shock, the man who's hiding hasn't thrown his mind out of his head.
You gave the man who gave you the best service medal.
What kind of blow are you talking about?
We've completely fooled the people.
The other three revolutions were categorized by party officials as follows: the end of the First Great Revolution and the establishment of the Republic; the passage of the Second Great Revolution into a multi-party period from the single-party period; the transition of the Third Revolution to social democracy with Bülent Ecevit...
He has the qualities and duties of the president.
Article 103 has the oath of office of the President.
We know that the concept of namus and honor is an important concept in this society.
If a man comes out and makes this promise, he will fulfill it to his death.
Because grace and honor are not discussed for us.
The man with the dictator's fault, what honor and namus mean to you.
What do you understand by grace and honor, why did you take this oath?
What does honor and honor mean to you?
I want to find out.
In a religious man, the concept of namus and honor is the main crown.
Their intention is not to lift the law of strike, but to judge the law of strike.
They don’t want the presidential system.
The presidential system, the presidential system.
Why do you reject the Ottoman parliamentary system?
Anyone who has one will do the right thing.
Is Parliamentary Work Healthy in Turkey?
No, it's not working.
If we bring freedom to democracy, the system will work.
They call it a blow, but they've strengthened the law of blow.
<0xC4><0xB0>zmir MP Mustafa Balbay, who announced his candidacy for the general presidency, did not participate in the race because he could not collect the signature of the 128 delegates required for the candidacy.
Balbay, who was able to collect 92 signatures, said, "I can't be a candidate under current conditions."
At the Council Hall, the MPs' party assembly (PM), the central executive board (MYK) and the members of the honorary board were allocated seats, noted that former CHP leader Mariz Baykal's sitting in the courts with the parties.
Gülay Edekçi, the Estonian deputy, instead of sitting in the seat for the deputies, came early and sat next to the seat for the chairman K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaroglu.
The meeting of Yalova MP Muharrem <0xC4><0xB0>nce with K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaroglu was one of the topics discussed at the board meeting.
Thinn explained that he was offered PM membership and that he did not accept it.
However, it was claimed from general central sources that the request for the meeting came from Fine and that PM membership was not recommended.
"No one can learn from these general central sources, the contents of the meeting from the Istanbul deputy Ali <0xC3><0x96>zcan."
It's like, "How do I know you've met two people?"
It's enough to say, "He's gone."
The sword-smith often applauded the press.
On the first day of the "Democracy, Change and Brotherhood Council" the party's (PM) stamp was struck.
K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu began working for the PM list at home after the board talks.
When preparing K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaroglu’s 100-person key list, he called Yakup Akkaya, Sencer Ayata, Ercan Karaka<0xC5><0x9F>, who said he did not want to take part in the management of the current MYK members, who had not applied to the PM.
It is stated that K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>zdaroglu can point to another list as well as a 100-person PM key list.
The outcome of the 21 articles adopted by the CHP Board of Directors, which were adopted unanimously, called for the removal of entries on the European Local Governance Standard, which were discussed by the DTK with autonomy debates, to increase the share of authority on the ground.
The declaration also included the objectives of "ending the party state order", "creating a law-enabled and accountable state of law".
The Deputy Chairman of the AK Party, Selçuk <0xC3><0x96>zda<0xC4><0x9F>, followed by Idris Baluken from the HDP, Ruhsar Demirel from the MHP.
The AK Party <0xC3><0x96>zda<0xC4><0x9F> and the AK Party party party have left the hall over K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu’s harsh criticism of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
He said, "I saw that the critical dose was missing, and I couldn't accept it."
The journalists detained in the hall, Can Dündar and Erdem Gül, took note of the "Peace" banner in Kurdish, Turkish and English with the banner "How to get the darkness to light if I don't burn you."
In the morning, the council started with the songs of Group Commentary and Ahmet Kaya.
The message sent to the board by the wife of Turkish Ambassador Tahir, President of Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Baro, who lost his life in the armed attack, was highly applauded.
Berkin Elvan's mother Rülsüm and father Sami Elvan also joined the board.
The part where K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>zdaroglu said that democracy would be "death" at any cost was the most applauding part of the speech.
So far, the CHP, which has gathered 52 seats, including 34 seats, has gathered its 53rd grand board at Ankara Arena.
Participation was high.
There were more than 12,000 CHPs in the 12,000-seat lounge.
However, there was no enthusiasm for the rights of the crowd.
The most exciting moment was when K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaroglu entered the hall with his wife, Selivi K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC4><0x87>daroglu.
The excitement continued as the couple greeted the Swordaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu salon.
There was no discipline in the AK party boards in the hall.
Even while speaking swordsmith, there was a lot of movement in the area on the field of the Arena.
Obviously, the CHPs who wished to join the Party Assembly preferred to seek support by telling themselves to party leaders and journalists.
A CHP official tried to say, "It's better than party figures, like party meetings in Korea or the Soviet Union, to sit down like a rope and sit motionless like a rope" that this is not a bad thing.
The CHP board is different from the AK Party or MHP boards.
In these parties, only the presidents speak.
At CHP, the board becomes a platform where party issues are also discussed.
Yesterday, when the number of parties wishing to speak in the council was too high, Divan President Murat Karayal<0xC4><0xB1>c<0xC4><0xB1>n had trouble setting up the time.
There was also a distance away from the comments on the faces and languages of "The nation is going bad" and "You're changing your way out of this hall with a painting."
All the CHPs didn't have a consistent and strong answer to the question of "what to do."
This has had a huge impact on the fact that no elections will be held in the next four years.
When he came to the Swordfighter's summit, we waited for the journalists to answer the question "what to do."
Swordsman first answered the question "What's going on?"
He drew attention to the issue of imprisoned journalists, to what academics did because of the report, to what happened in the Southeast, to the lack of foreign policy.
He has long responded to the “Anatolian legends” of the party, such as “the free party,” “supports the contributions”, “the party of elitists”.
When it came to the "what to do" stage, he tried to create "strategy" instead of talking about substantive steps.
He stressed that he could overcome all these problems with a stronger democracy with more justice.
He also made a promise on behalf of the CHP and said, "We will work whatever the cost until we bring democracy."
"We're going to fight to death for democracy," he said.
One last note; it should be recalled that the CHP handled the issue of "organization" in the 53rd board, and can now gather in the board without problems.
In the meantime, 900 journalists who were told they were going to follow the board were printed, but the reporter's attendance in the hall was not at that level.
The representatives of the media organizations in Ankara were also not as willing as the AK Party boards were to follow the board.

FedEx revenues are confused, financial outlook will fall in 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the past three months, and the freight giant reduced its year-round profit forecast due to the decline in demand for freight services and increased costs for land services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Last year, FedEx announced it would buy 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
It fell about 2.5% in transactions 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday's opening day.
FedEx Corp. said earnings are expected to range from <0x24>10.40 to <0x24>10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than previous estimates.
Analysts were expecting <0x24>10.84 based on research by FactSet.
On average, it is likely to rise by 4.9% in January and drop in heavy or large package black shipping despite the high acceleration that will start in November.
According to the company, the cost cuts are higher in revenue and the profits from e-commerce growth are still expected to be high compared to the previous year.
President and CEO Fred Smith said the company “has shown strong performance, especially in manufacturing and global trade, despite the weak economic conditions expected.”
The holiday employment plans were unveiled a day after the rival firm UPS, according to which UPS said it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, the same number as last year.
In the three-month period ending on August 31, FedEx earned <0x24>692 million in revenues by 6% compared to the previous year.
Earnings per share occurred at the level of <0x24>2.42, remaining behind the <0x24>2.44 estimates of 12 analysts consulted by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue increased 5% to <0x24>12.3 billion.
The six analysts interviewed by Zacks were expecting <0x24>12.23 billion.
FedEx hit last year with a backlash in international priority shipping, which caused revenue to stall in the Express unit.
However, the explosion in online shopping increased the results of FedEx Land Services.
In the last quarter, land services revenues increased by 29 percent, but business revenues mainly stopped due to large packages and high costs in internal insurance.
The express unit saw a high income due to its high base rates, while the labour costs were falling in the freight business.
In pre-open trades about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell to <0x24>3.85 or <0x24>150.15 by 2.5%.
They closed Tuesday for the year with a 11% and a 17% drop below the record level on June 11.
At the most anticipated meetings in years, Federal Reserve politicians decided this week to spend two days around the table of a 27-year-old Honduran monk who has spent almost a decade raising interest rates.
The two-story meeting room, located on one wing of the central bank, will be a picture of the wall of the United States.
The map is a reminder of Janet L. Yellen, Female President of the Fed, and her colleagues holding the nation’s economic interests above everything else.
There are two tasks the central bank takes from Congress: to raise U.S. employment to the highest level and to keep prices here stable.
But since the Great Tribulation, Fed leaders have admitted that there is a third unwritten vecality: financial equilibrium.
And this third wicket is a close enough decision to predict whether the U.S. economy, which will be announced on Thursday, is ready to start cutting its unique stimulus support from its current near-zero rate since the end of 2008.
While most data shows that the economy is growing in a solid way, the recent upheaval in global financial markets can now make careful Fed officials frightened by increasing federal funds interest rates – even less than a quarter – by increasing vulnerability.
“The job market and inflation will be the first and most important thing they watch,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they are looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the increasing uncertainty surrounding the global market will give them enough reason to wait a little longer,” he said.
They have no idea what the Fed is going to do, and this leads to fluctuations in the financial markets themselves.
Recently, half of Bloomberg’s economists expected an interest rate increase this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to stay on hold with the main indicator, which shows only a 30 percent probability of an increase.
If the Fed raises the rate, policy makers can point to a drop in the stock market if they do not alleviate the impact by promising that another increase may be on the way.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industry index average rose by 228.89 points or 1.4 percent to 16,599.85.
Moody's Capital Markets Research Group chief economist John Lonski said, "The Fed's share of policy makers was triggered by the expectation that the dispute would remain stable this week."
"It would be surprising that the Fed is increasing the rates right now," he said.
If the Fed’s managers had made a decision in this direction, they would have to take a long year to calm the financial markets so they wouldn’t panic.
Other experts have suggested that a rise in interest rates could calm financial markets due to the rise of the Fed’s sis curtain on when it will take action.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be on its way to an increase of 0.25 points this month, which would be a small step towards slowing monetary conditions, empowering the U.S. to accumulate.
Yellen said that despite complaints from liberals about the need for a more economic process, he expected this year’s rate increase in the spring and early summer.
Despite the decline in job creation rate in August, growth in the labour market was steady this year.
Last month, the unemployment rate fell to the lowest level in seven years, at 5.1%, and reached the level where the Fed counted full employment.
Salary increases showed signs of improvement.
And even though the inflation central bank continues to look below its annual 2% target, Fed politicians said the temporary impact of sharply falling oil prices was a major cause.
The chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, Ian Shepherdson, said the economy "can cope with higher rates and needs it despite the tightness in the labour market."
However, financial markets around the world began to shake after China’s currency collapsed at the end of last month.
The Dow Jones industry index average fell to less than 16% of May’s record-breaking level due to fears of a slowing Chinese economy’s global growth.
The market jumped somewhat backwards when Dow’s high level in May was now almost 10%.
For Fed policy makers, market volatility makes it even more complicated to calculate the time when the interest rate will increase.
Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research partner at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official, said: "The lack of knowledge of what is best in the financial markets in China for the last few weeks and the lack of news about economic weakening may have been somewhat reduced in this meeting."
He now predicts that they will wait at least another month to better manage these effects.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about the impacts on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to suggest that developments in China go forward," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s priority concerns, so it should not be technically impactful in the process of landing.
But the Fed has actually become the world’s monetary authority.
The impact of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The only hint from President Ben S. Bernanke at the time was that the Fed could "reduce" the monetary genocide triggered by market uprisings around the world in 2013.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly crowded together, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central bank managers and experts to better read the global economy.
Asset management firm Envestnet Inc.’s global strategy chief Zachary Karabell said the decision-making process was “more talent than science.”
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va. President Jeffrey Lacker pointed out this month that "the Fed has exaggeratedly reacted to unseen financial market movements linked to economic foundations in the past."
Lacker, a member of the politically constructive Federal Open Market Committee with voting rights and pressure to increase the ratio, cited, for example, 1998-99 decisions.
"Despite limited identifiable recommendations for U.S. growth," Lacker said, prompting the Fed to cut the index by 0.75 percent during three meetings in Asia.
A year later, Fed officials recovered these cuts.
Adam S. Posen, a former member of the British Central Bank's Rate Determination Committee, said: "The Fed should only prioritize its financial balance concerns during major crises, as in the 2008 market meltdown."
He said his last bat doesn't get to that level.
You really don’t want to stay in fear of going to a rate increase because the markets are sluggish, said Peterson’s President of the International Institute of Economics Posen.
The Central Bank Act still has two powers and does not mention financial equilibrium, and I do not think that they should act in this direction until this change.
Do you want a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in the Chinese neighborhood.
Yes, the Chinese neighborhood.
It was opened in 1997 and belongs to LAX-C <0xC5><0x9E>ti.
The LAX-C is often called Thai Costco, a wholesale Thai market that sells to the LAX-C ring.
Yeah, that's the Chinese neighborhood, not the Taiwanese neighborhood.
Sunday/depot is a one-stop shop; it sells a large number of fresh, frozen and dried foods, popular Asian and Thai snacks, kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
If you want to buy engine oil, there's even an automotive part.
The store is huge and it can take an hour to walk through all its corridors.
If you’re hungry at all of this shopping, buy food from LAX-C BBQ Eksres.
The interior of the store is next to the (good, calculated) drawers, and there are various options to take out.
What's in stock: Do you want something from Thailand?
It's probably in LAX-C.
The products are reasonably priced and some are sold in bulk.
Fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai spices, fruits and more.
The meat rack is very comprehensive, so does the fish - the workers behind the counter clean the fish and make fillets, even if you want to.
A large section of the store has a large freezer section; there you can find frozen deer leaves, painful turkeys and galaxies, all insects, fish, dandelion blood, fish balls, regional sausages, commercial food and more.
Who is shopping: Restaurant owners and chefs, families and individuals.
There are both shopping carts and forklifts in the wide corridors.
Found: Fresh monthong durian exit stand next to.

Park: LAX-C has its own parking space, it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although the store is very busy, it’s usually not difficult to find a parking space.
Brazil’s Rio Grande Paediatric Society Promotes Healthy Nutrition During Breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS applied a shocking method to place pictures of infants depicted with unhealthy nutritional descriptions to try and explain to women in their breastfeeding processes.
Human milk has come from a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provides babies with all the nutrients they need to develop a healthy immune system.
Because of their over-energy requirements, it is recommended that new mothers and pregnant women increase their daily calorie intake to around 500 calories.
However, according to new research, the dietary supplements that mothers should take are not limited to just calorie intake.
According to a new study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Texas Baylor College of Medicine, pregnant women’s healthy diets protect them from developing tumors by affecting the genetic expression of their babies.
Unfortunately, unhealthy eating has been deemed to negatively affect the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise continues to excel in ratings despite Nine's efforts to take the lead on Today Show
The moves that Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson made to Canberra in order to overthrow the Liberal leadership failed to provide a rating increase for Today.
After the fall of Tony Abbott's Malcolm Turnbull, Nine's breakfast show was staged in the national capital.
The Rival Sunrise, hosted in London by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, is crammed between Dubai, New York, the Niagara Falls and Cancun’s weekly international series.
As the issue of distance does not make much difference for Australian viewers, Today has an average of 397,000 Sunrise viewers in five capitals, equivalent to 339,000.
Today recorded a slight increase in ratings compared to last Tuesday (283,000), but the figure was still behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been shutting down with Sunrise in recent months.
Today's average of 330,000 Sunrise in August was 318,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
Today's Sunrise average is 349,000, compared to today's 314,000 numbers in September.
It's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting your people more than parliament this morning!
Karl and Lisa are good, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the breathtaking start of the 800 Word by Erik Thomson, the old star of Packed to the Rafters.
A new drama about a newly widowed father’s decision to move to the seaside in New Zealand with his two children reached an impressive average of 1,219 million.
Critics questioned whether Thomson could perform a solo show without Rafters's retirement from Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night was a whispering "yes" answer.
Seven's X Factor retained its power with 1,136 million viewers, easily defeating Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven Two Followers mixed their night luck with Austria.
The first half hour of the new information competition hosted by Andrew O'Keefe (17:00-17:30) reached an average of 446,000 spectators.
In the second half (17:30-18:00) the number jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory against Eddie Mc Guire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, Australia's first half-hour of follow-up reached an average of 520,000 in the second half-hour, and this figure rose to 720,000.
The hot seat had an average of 620,000.
Follow thought Australia's second night rating drop would give Nine the Hot Seat an advantage at 5.30 p.m.
Following Australia, McGuire's show was a milestone change in the Million Dollar Minute that didn't have a tooth.

The remaining three people think that Single Sam Wood is the perfect man – but who will he choose?
Has the secret come to light?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have revealed who will win Bekari without being aware.
At the end of Sam Wood's Singles program, the woman was kept in great secrecy.
And the other three girls are doing their best to not tell who's the last laugh.
But the day before the three fell into two, Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have given a clue about who the winner is going to be.
Sam Wood seals his mouth until Thursday's final
The three women explained why Wood was perfect in a lyrical language; they said why they wanted to be his partner, emphasizing his temperament, passion, family values, and positive attitude.
But the answers to the question "If you're not, who should take Wood's last rose?" may contain information about who will win The Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the best candidate for Wood besides themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been very close since day one.
Jeavons-Fellows said: "From the moment I came home, I felt that reading [Sarah’s] energy and Sam’s energy were appropriate to each other, and that’s what I thought throughout the program."
Markoski added, "Sarah is very practical, it's so fun to be around her."
I saw them together, and there's a chemistry between them.
They feel very good and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are going to be a very good-looking couple.
Mackay said last week's home visits thought Wood was the "right person."
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was definitely not just a game - I'm completely attached to him now," she said.
If he wasn't, when asked who Wood could choose, it was a mystery.
"I don't know if I can say that," he said.
"I love other girls equally - Snezana and Lana equal."
The Bachelor is broadcast on the Ten Channel on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
First post: Is Sam Wood the best choice for Sarah?
Jarryd Hayne had a variety of options for where to start his NFL career.
After Detroit and Seattle moved to the United States, they showed great interest in him, and many other teams approached him after last year’s impressive open day of training.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and that seems to be a very wise decision.
Some coaches replaced Hayne as a substitute due to losing performance in the Australian rugby league, as they won 20-3 against Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula believed this man and gave Hayne another chance to play in a game after Reggie Bush's injury.
After the game, Tomsula continued to show her real color to the dressing room.
Instead of humiliating them in front of the whole team, he gave them courage.
Tomsula also clearly supported Hayne at the post-match press conference.
49ers reporter Cam Inman said Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey and advised him to forget about this downfall and think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne caused the Minnesota Vikings to score in the first quarter and dropped the ball
This was not what Hayne and her large Australian fans dreamed of for the first game in the NFL.
Hayne was seen cheating out of the field after dropping the ball and then told Australian radio duo Hamish and Andy that he couldn't think of a worse start for NFL career at 2DayFM 104.1.
Hayne said, "It was just one of those things, you're sorry for the next game, and that's it."
Hayne also recalled the first game of Origin in 2007 with a backstory to Queensland.
It was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a post on Instagram while holding an Australian flag with fans after the game.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights

Khodorkovsky, who openly opposed President Vladimir Putin, was imprisoned, handed over the oil company to Yukos, and his anti-democracy efforts were shortened.
In Nepal, four people have died as a result of a plastic bullet fractured by police
According to an official on Wednesday, four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed as a result of police shooting at a crowd who protested against the new constitution proposed in the country.
The incident took place on Tuesday evening in the city of Rupandehi, 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
The county chief official, Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, said more than 1,000 phase protesters gathered outside a police station and some threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said before using plastic bullets, the police used pepper gas and fired into the air.
Twenty police and five civilians were injured.
It's unclear why plastic bullets used are known to be a less lethal alternative because they're such a high lethal case.
The clash has been the latest in violent protests across Nepal’s southern plains for weeks, where Madhesi is advocating that the new constitution proposed to members of the ethnic group will see its own political impact.
The ethnic group Tharus, which wants to establish its own states, is also protesting in western Nepal.
Since August 10, at least 11 people have lost their lives, including at least 40 police officers, in violent clashes.
Four major political parties had agreed to divide the country into regions at this date – a significant but creative step in the development of a new constitution in central-state Nepal, which has been governed for centuries.
Studies on a new constitution have been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake in April that killed thousands of people.
The lawmakers worked on the provisions of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and authorities said the new text would be edited until Sunday.
NHC says there is a 60 percent chance of hurricane in the southern Cape Verde Islands
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday that a large low pressure system south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands is 60 percent likely to turn into a tropical hurricane within the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low-pressure system was also seen between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, and the Miami-based weather forecasting center said there was a 60 percent likelihood of a tropical hurricane occurring within the next two days.
Google launches donation matching campaign to raise <0x24>11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced a donation-co-operation campaign aimed at raising <0x24>11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees in Europe fleeing their poor and deprived countries from the war.
Google has announced a donation initiative on its blog with an unexpected personal approach.
Instead of a manager making this statement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabila with her family at the age of seven, wrote her own personal experience.
"Alongside hunger, thirst, cold and fear, we had a lot of dark buses and train trips," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But because the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe is growing, many families like my family need help.
The donations will go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, the Children Rescue and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would match the first <0x24>5.5 million donation until it raises <0x24>11 million at google.com/refugeelief.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, the biggest reason for this year’s four-year Syrian civil war, which has killed more than 4 million people.
Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya, which have been damaged by many wars, are also fleeing.

Weight loss surgery can help in patients with moderate obesity
According to a new study, the benefit of obesity surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years.
But it’s too early to say whether patients with moderately obese diabetes live longer than those who haven’t had surgery after obesity surgery.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, who wrote an article in a new study on JAMA surgery and expert on obesity surgery, "it takes a long time for death rates to self-determine."
Weight loss surgeries, otherwise called bariatric surgery, use various methods to reduce the stomach diameter.
These reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to digest food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been done on advanced obese people with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
The BMI, which is measured over the proportion of a kilogram of height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A person with a BMI of 25 or more is overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 or more are considered obese.
BMI can be calculated from the following link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, Taiwan's full-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital has used data from the experiment they compared two types of bariatric surgery performed in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes to medium degree obesity since 2007.
Since the end of the fifth year of the study, the average BMI of those undergoing surgery has risen from 31 to 24.5.
The BMI of those with non-surgical diabetes treatment has remained stable at around 29.
Diabetes is partially resolved in 36% of people undergoing surgery.
In the medically treated group, diabetes was resolved in only 1% and only partially in 2% compared to this.
Also, according to the authors, blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were generally better in the "group with surgical intervention".
The researchers also showed blood levels of A1c hemoglobin, which reflected blood sugar levels in patients over time.
According to researchers, it is best to keep the A1c hemoglobin below 7%.
After surgery, hemoglobin A1c decreased from an average of 9% to about 6%.
In the medical treatment group, it remained stable at about 8%.
However, with improved A1c hemoglobin levels, this improved "glycemic control" did not decrease the mortality rate over the past five years, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and teammates who conducted the study.
The research team compared the findings obtained with these two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the group with tube stomach surgery lost more weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), BMI (7.4 to 5.1), and similarly A1c hemoglobin (3.1 to 2.1 %), with a higher decrease of 16% and a higher overall increase of 16% (46 to 2.1 %) of diabetes.
Although the study did not indicate a clear benefit to survival after the end of the fifth year of surgery, Dr. Blackstone of the Arizona Medical College-Phoenix said that according to a study conducted in heavier patients in Sweden, the surgery extended the lifespan.
In this Swedish study, obese patients who had bariatric surgery were 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years compared to another group who had received more traditional treatment.
While this new study hasn’t shown what the benefits of surgical patients’ survival are, according to Blackstone, it’s reassuring for those under 35 with BMI.
The most rewarding part of the article is also here, because in the group with low BMI, it is said that this surgery is safe, there has been no increase in the risk of death or kidney disorders, he said.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should start taking the weight-loss issue seriously as patients fall below BMI 27 to 30.
"I think we've been waiting long enough for people to take this issue seriously," he said.
I think it's really hard to reverse this after collecting these genetic changes that make their bodies associated with obesity and diabetes.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama, who says Europe will not be able to host all refugees, added that the real solution lies in the Middle East to the current refugee crisis.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the countries of refugees.
At the beginning of a 10-day visit to Britain, the Dalai Lama spoke about the ongoing refugee crisis at the Dalai Lama Compassion Center’s opening speech in Oxford.
Under the current conditions, he claimed that rather than the interests of countries or continents, the interests of humanity should be at the forefront.
At the same time, he stressed, however appreciated, that the responses of countries in Western Europe to the refugee crisis are inadequate in this regard.
In his speech, he said, “It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe.”
Although Germany and Austria appreciated their efforts to cope with the crisis, the Dalai Lama claimed that these were only temporary solutions.
“It’s great to care for a few thousand refugees, but you also have to think about long-term solutions; you should think about how to bring lasting peace and sustainable development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education,” he said.
We need to think about how we can reduce deaths in our country.
We need to reduce power consumption.
The use of power has never been a solution to the problems.”
Speaking on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also mentioned what George Bush was doing after the September 11 attacks, and said that the U.S. launched a chain of uncontrollable responses to violence.
In my letter to President Bush after September 11, I expressed my best wishes for health and stated that the way to solve this problem was through non-violent methods.
I know that the squads are well-intentioned, but he used force and led to unexpected results," the Dalai Lama said.
4-fold increase in hand antiseptics seen in children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the United States have reported an increase of nearly 400 per cent in high-alcohol-containing wet stools seen in children under the age of 12 since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, hand antiseptic swallowing cases in 12 under-age children reported to have risen from 3,266 cases in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
Lopez told CNN: "Children are more addicted to these types of products, and unfortunately, there are those among them who will be relieved of distress."
Some children said they were drinking hand-antiseptics knowingly, while others said they did so in influencing their friends or claiming to be social media.
Videos on YouTube show young people who drink antiseptics for cheap drunkenness.
Some teenagers have been reported to mix their antiseptic mixture with oral water containing alcohol to achieve a harder interior.
Young children can be infected with attractive antiseptic odors.
Lopez said, "The child doesn't think it's a bad thing."
Most of those who are more attractive (the antiseptics) are those who smell.
Hand antiseptics with berries, grapes and orange flavors that are extremely attractive to children are available.
Wherever you look at hand antiseptics, it contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few storms can cause alcohol poisoning.
Dr. Stephen Thornton, president of the University of Kansas Hospital for Intoxication, told Fox 4 television in Kansas that he was "highly concentrated alcohol."
You don’t leave a few glasses of whiskey around, but people leave these hand-held antiseptics in the middle, and this is an easy way to get a fairly high amount of alcohol for kids.
Recently, at school, the six-year-old Nhaijah Russell, who had swallowed only four times more strawberry-scented hand antiseptics, was relieved of the need for treatment.
The alcohol in his blood was 0.179, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency service doctor at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta, this ratio was twice the legal alcohol limit accepted in an adult human.
He could not pronounce the words, and he could not walk when he came to the emergency room.
According to Rithey, because the alcohol caused the little girl to fall down and hit her head, the doctors kept her under observation throughout the night in a separate pediatric hospital despite any signs of brain trauma.
In a statement to CNN, Mother Ortia Scott said she was "very frightening."
He could've been a killer for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or shorten the skinny theme of antiseptic cuffs and remove them from places that children could not reach.
Apart from alcohol poisoning, some antiseptics were found to be associated with death cases.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died of a hand-eating antiseptic that contained an unexplained toxic substance.
Health officials argued that the substance in question could be methyl alcohol, not ethyl alcohol, as stated in the list, but with a deadly effect.
In January, three students from the north of New York had plotted to "place antibacterial products around the classroom," according to police reports, with the aim of poisoning "bad-hearted" teachers.
The teacher banned his use in the classroom because he was highly allergic to hand antiseptics.
The plan, which has been passed before the police, has proposed a disciplinary penalty for the school administration by calling it "an empty attempt".

And you and your friends will watch my training.
He said, "I'm waiting for you."
The coffee party is innocent.
I'm a humanist today.
I wish there were no deaths.
But it's possible!
This world is evil.
Felekse kape.
There is death in fate.
And it hurts.
Also an alien invasion.
It's a lightning strike.
Sometimes it's a hitting spacecraft.
Maybe a meteor.
I'm not saying it's death.
I'm not saying, let's get our signature.
Let's check our reaction.
Let's face it, guys, let's face it!
You're our magician.
You should be ashamed of the party.
But it's not fucking embarrassing!
Two weeks ago, they killed Miray Ince in <0xC5><0x9E><0xC4><0xB1>rnak's Sur Village.
It's still three months.
His grandfather was with him.
They killed him too.
What can we say, you bastard! On January 3, they killed Joseph the Ointment in Silopi.
I think he was running away from aliens.
They searched for a safe place for him.
He had his wife with him.
A day later, Angel Alpayd<0xC4><0xB1>n was killed at the breakfast table on Little Transit Street in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r.

An unidentified object cost the lives of these little ones with a ton of explosives.
There were others who died and those who were injured.
Who's the culprit?
Felek, of course.
Coffee parties.
No, he's not the one with the hat.
The coffee party is innocent!
The killer is out there, holding his hand and smiling at our face.
Some are trying to get attention in a different direction.
While the killer is in front of us, it creates opportunities for him to escape instead of pointing to the killer.
The killer's cool.
He's hiding it.
Even after he disappeared, it tells him that what happened to him wasn't actually a crime.
The sides of the fight we've been fighting over the past 10 years are very clear.
Someone wants to cut the circle of fire around us, and he wants us to burn.
Somebody's trying to stop it, and others are trying to extinguish the fire around us.
You're in trouble of robbing someone.
To make someone, to produce.
There are those who see all kinds of war in our region.
The Civil War.
The Inter-State War.
The Mezheples War.
The Battle of Vekalet.
And they've got stones.
Dirty terrorist organizations.
They're bloody thieves.
In different names, in different formats.
Turkey has no other chance than to fight each one of them.
He's fighting, and that's why he's in a position to talk to all of them.
Continue to fight until you're sure of your...

Saudi Arabia has not given up on T<0xC3><0x9C>B<0xC4><0xB0>TAK
The Minister of Science, Industry and Technology, Idikri Ivik, announced that the Balistic Image Analysis and Recognition System (BALISTICA) was developed by the Turkish Scientific and Technical Research Foundation (TUBITAK) and that the new system was established from the second part of the sale to Saudi Arabia.
The light has been found in explanations about BALISTICA developed by the T<0xC3><0x9C>B<0xC4><0xB0>TAK Institute of Space Technologies.
Light explains that the system allows ballistic examinations of the weapons, bullet nuclei and bullets to be compared with the data in the central database, so that ballistic experts avoided the problems they encountered while examining the bullet nuclei and bullet nuclei.
The light indicated that the data obtained from different geographical locations and the accompanying information could be questioned by concealing together through BALISTICS.
Light, noting that one of the most important features of BALISTICA is the ability to obtain and display three-dimensional data that gives more detail and less errors, has the ability to make decisions that the ballistics specialist can quickly make thanks to the innovations brought by the system.
BALISTIKA was exported under the "SUBA-1 Project"
He noted that BALISTIKA met all the criteria in its success measurements and that the system established in 10 separate regions, including Ankara, which drew the full score from the Directorate General of Security, I<0xC5><0x9B>ik, covered the whole of Turkey.
As a result of the success of the system, L<0xC4><0xAB>k said that it was launched abroad, recalled that BALISTIKA was exported within the framework of the "SUBA-1 Project" carried out with Saudi Arabia and that its establishment was successfully completed in 6 regions in 2013.
The light says that BALISTIKA has made another new agreement for the second party sale to Saudi Arabia, stating that the SUBA-1, which is the continuation of the SUBA-2, has been signed, with the agreement that the development and installation of additional 8 systems will be covered by the service in Saudi Arabia.
Bus-sized typhoon fossil found
It was reported that the prehistoric sea turtle was 10 meters long and weighed 3 tons.
The length of the skull was only 1.6 meters.
The researchers published the findings in the journal Cretaceous Research, giving the species the name "Machimosaurus rex".
Federico Fanti of the University of Bologna, the author of the paper, said the fossil appears to be 130 million years old "almost the size of a bus."
Fanti, who spoke to the Washington Post, said the giant-sized saltwater squirrel was "at least at the top of the food chain in a certain region at that time."
Paleontologists have explained that M. rex, who is thought to be the largest shark living in the sea, was hunted by hunting pussy on lakes.
The largest freshwater shark in history is thought to be the "Sarcosuchus emperor" who lived in Africa and South America 110 million years ago and was able to reach 12 meters in length and weigh 8 tons.
They're all so confused!
The first book by author Ece Teelkuran in 1996, 'The Head of All Women is Mixed', was adapted to the theater by the Aysa Production Theatre of the same name.
Sea Chick, Zeynep Kankonde, Silk Turkan Sundak, Kadir <0xC4><0x8C>ermik and Sebnem Sönmez are playing Selen Extreme.
The first time that Uçer, who continues the games 'Poz' and 'Dry Thick', has written and directed the game for the first time, the confusion in women's minds is questioned.
The game met with an audience at the Trump Show Center last week.
The game starts with the radio theater.
In the dark, a sound that takes us to the past years...
Then the curtain opens.
A woman standing on the side of the window, jumping down.
It's clear who he is and why he commits suicide, by interfering with his neighbors.
ONE MEDICINAL PRODUCTS
'Ebru Uysal', a popular writer animated by Sea Chakra.
She was abandoned by her husband, but that's not the only reason.
There's stuff in it that's been accumulating since you were a kid.
His disapproval of his father’s love, his exclusion from his student life, his solitary childhood, his misunderstandings, his thinking that he didn’t understand it, brought him to this point.
He then decided to commit suicide by leaving a letter, but he can't jump out of the glass.
Because the mysterious woman Perran (Sönnez Shebnem) who sits in the apartment opposite 'Aysel' (Zeynep Kankonde), the cleaner of the side apartment, speaks to her.
They're approaching the situation like a normal process.
The woman can't be more focused, she can't be more focused.
When the trio joins the conversation, the famous singer 'Meltem Kaya' (Silk Turktan Source) who cleaned up his house, the event turns well into a turquoise.
Meltem, who approaches the situation in a naive and intimate way, can’t stop singing when he sees the crowd below.
This interesting suicide attempt gains a different size with the real estate agent 'Murat' (Kadir Chermik) entering the girl's house with a backup key.
The singer's "Meltem's lying to the press" is out of his mouth.
Nazan Vorcel's "Street Girl" is also used in the game.
BUNALIM G<0xC3><0x9C>LD<0xC3><0x9C>R<0xC3><0x9C>S<0xC3><0x9C>
For the first time, Uçer has managed to ensure the pace and streamliness of the game.
Zeynep Kankonde draws the comedy load of the game from Silk Door.
Types of cartoon that the two animated; they manage to laugh the audience with necessary imitations and necessary replies.
<0xC5><0xA0>ebnem Sönmez conveys his years of experience to the stage very well, while Sea Scrolls exhibits a compelling performance reflecting the depressing mood of 'Ebru Uysal'.
Kadir <0xC4><0x8C>ermik, who mentioned the award-winning film by Tolga <0xC4><0x8C>elik for her performance in 'Sarma<0xC5><0x9F>yk', also successfully accompanies these four women.
The single curtain game, described as a comedy, is about laughing without being confused.
Most of the beautiful words that come out of Perran’s mouth played by Shebnem Sönmez are those in my mind: They read the Qur’anic writing; they see the Qur’anic life.
All the children have once thought of dying to punish their parents, and finally think why they've always cried.
A woman hangs in the air like an incomprehensible joke.
A woman is always looking for a funny story where she forgets her most important place.
In fact, every story starts with some sort of abandonment.
Sometimes I have to put my hands in my pocket; I can’t stand things without my pocket.
You wonder where you'll put your hands.
Surprisingly, our hands are multiplied.
People who don't know what you're talking about are inventing.
A misunderstanding is real.
Every woman's head is confused because it's confused.
You've got a chance to live because you can't die.
"Long live the consumption of kefir"
Can be consumed safely at any age
The main ingredient that doesn't end up counting health benefits is milk, but the miracle nutrient kefir is more beneficial than milk is one of the nutrients that can be consumed safely at any age, the expert dietitian says in the Rule of Nutrition is "more nutritious than yoghurt, because it contains vitamins and B-proteins.
It is also rich in vitamins B1, B12 and K.
Thanks to its calcium and magnesium content, it forms the basis of a healthy nervous system.
It is also a good source of phosphorus.
Kefir, which also has the ability to hold the skirt, also does not lose weight at the same time.
“The nutritional value is quite high, and my digestion is an easy drink,” he said.
This is the third deva.
The expert dietitian P<0xC4><0xAB>nar Rule Enç, who says that children, elderly, pregnant and menopausal women can consume kefir without any hesitation, says, "Kefir is a local beverage made in the Caucasus."
But now he's starting to tell the Earth his name.
The secret to youth is kefir, which is a long and healthy way of life.
One of the most natural ways to keep babies away from metabolic diseases is bypass.
The friend of the intestines
This unique drink, which does not end up counting benefits, is your gut friend.
In our intestines there are 1.5-2 kilograms of bacteria and fungi.
The microorganisms in the digestive system are divided into two groups as beneficial and harmful.
Useful microorganisms are called "probiotic microorganisms."
The activities of probiotics have as important an effect as our liver, and when consumed enough, they prevent harmful microorganisms in the gut from sticking and spreading to the intestinal wall.
Deterioration of the balance of healthy microorganisms in the gut causes many diseases.
With proper nutrition, the health of the digestive tract should be preserved.
To do this, we need to consume enough probiotics.
It eliminates these problems in the gut.
Kefir is the most effective nutrient containing probiotic bacteria, and the beneficial bacteria in it have a huge effect on the strengthening of the intestinal system.
It allows the beneficial bacteria and fungi in the gut to reproduce and be beneficial in a healthy way.
With regular use of kefir, the intestines work, eliminate intestinal disorders, reduce swelling and have a healthier digestion.
A healthy gut system means a healthy and disease-free body.
“Impairment, insomnia, respiratory infections and allergies, which are also good for kefir, also help to get more quality vitamins and minerals that babies will get from nutrients, so it also plays an important role in baby nutrition,” he said.
He wants to continue where he is.

Mersin Idmanyurdu said that after Nurullah Saglam, he will be without a technician against Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> because he has not yet reached an agreement with a new name.
Letters Feeling From Small Students
The police and soldiers carrying out terrorist operations in the area, including the central Sur district of Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r, received a letter from children in the West for moral purposes.
Starting at 75.
<0xC4><0xB0>stanbul West Ata<0xC5><0x9F>ehir High School of Natural Sciences and Eski<0xC5><0x9F>ehir Ata<0xC5><0x9F>a<0xC4><0x9F>an High School students started working as a coordinator.
As a result of these studies, students in schools printed the choreography they created the moon star shape on the chocolates, and then wrote poetry and paintings close to each other.
The children then sent the work they did to the Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Security Directorate.
The Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Security Directorate set up an exhibition table on the work of children in the West as a coordinator.
The exhibition, which was established in the new Security Directorate building, was attended by students.
The exhibition was first visited by the police who served in the Security Directorate building and the citizens who carried out the transaction.
The letters of meaningful writings and poems to each other made those who read pictures feel.
A student who wrote a letter about the operations in the Central Sur district said in his letter, "We thank you for the sacrifice you made to protect innocent people in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r."
We've learned that the exhibition will last until next week.
She named her daughter Angela Merkel.
The name of German Prime Minister Angela Merkel, sometimes criticized for her refugee policies, was given to another refugee baby.
The 26-year-old Memun El Hamza and his 21-year-old wife Tema El Havar, who escaped the war in Syria, named their first children "Angela Merkel".
Speaking to the German press, Tema El Havar, “We are grateful to be here.
We gave our daughter the name Angela Merkel to show it."
Father Memun El Hamza spoke in the form of "Germany became like a mother to us".
THIS TWO "MERKEL"
The baby Angela Merkel was born on December 27.
According to the German press, the health of Angela Merkel, who was born with a weight of 3 kilograms (300 grams) and a height of 55 centimeters, is good.
Last year, a Ghanaian refugee named her daughter Angela Merkel, and some refugees had opened "Merkel Mama" banners to support Merkel.
Consumer confidence in the U.S. at 7-month peak
According to university data, UMICH increased by 0.7 points to 93.3 in January compared to the end of December.
As a result, the market expectation for the index, which recorded its highest level since June 2015, was set at 92.9.
Michigan Consumer Research Director Richard Curtin said in a written statement, “Consumer confidence has been the fourth month to see an increase in expectations for future economic growth.”
"Individual financing expectations have also maintained their highest level since 2007 due to the overall weakness in inflation," he said.
In the statement, it was also predicted that consumer optimism would depend on inflation to continue to remain incredibly low.
UMICH, which recorded its best annual performance since 2004, averaged 92.9 to 50 questions per month from a survey of at least 500 people.

Putin is whispering.
While Russia is preparing to recognize the status of Turkish companies "can do business with Russia" in case Turkey cannot meet the services offered by Turkey, the Russian Tour Operators Association has also declared "Russian citizens are not giving up from Turkey".
The Russian Ministry of Economic Development, which estimates that the splitting of existing economic ties with Turkey will bring additional costs to Russia, has prepared and published a new "Exclusive Cases" design for the Russian government.
According to the draft published in the Federal Regulations of Russia, even if it enters the construction area, it is expected that Turkish companies and their companies will be allowed to do business with Russia.
According to the design, it will be impossible to provide from other sources outside Turkey, or in cases where domestic production in Russia will bring serious additional costs, the Turkish company and its companies will be able to benefit from the products and services.
In this category, which Turkish goods and services will be included, the karma commission will be set up in cooperation with other relevant ministries within the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
Thus, it will be possible to decide which Turkish company can work with Russia by choosing bureaucrats.
Again, according to the same document, private companies with state institutions in Russia will have to prove to the commission that the work they will do with Turkish partners is not precedent.
If the design is approved by the Russian government, the registration of the licensed Turkish companies will also be established in Russia.
The Russian Tour Operators Association also said in a statement yesterday that Russian citizens did not give up on Turkey.
The statement added: "Despite the Russian Foreign Ministry's advice not to go to Turkey, the tur sales ban has begun to seek the formula for our citizens to organize their holidays on their own."
The number of posts titled “The Most Practical and Cheapest Way to Vacation in Turkey” on social networks is growing.
The most common suggestion is to book a hotel online and fly with THY.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev described the price of oil below <0x24>30 as a "dramatic" development for Russia.
Medvedev said: “It was a very bad surprise for our government, as no one has ever thought of falling to <0x24>30.
With this move, it seems that it will not be possible for the budget to be implemented as it is now."
This is the last month of 2015 we left behind.
In the wake of the crash, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the economic downturns would deepen.
In those days, our businessmen, who are accustomed to going to Russia in order, our THY personnel are officially dragging at the border gates.
Turkish goods are exported in customs, subject to unintended checks.
It's not much of a month, and Nerdun Hacchio<0xC4><0x9F>lu reports from Moscow yesterday.
One way or another, it's a slippery slope.
But why?
The reason is simple.
In a time when the economy has become so globalized, you are no longer trying to turn political conflicts into economic war by closing the doors with the methods of a century ago.
Look, we're still writing news about Iran and how the economic embarkation, which has been applied for years, has gone crazy.
The two neighboring countries, which seem to have many friends like Russia and Turkey, but which are not quite the same, actually need each other.
It is not technically possible to break up these two countries that are merged with their employer, their tourism entrepreneur, and their customers on such a night.
If you close the doors, the people of these two countries will enter each other's country.
It is best to make a political debate at the table and calculate it there before creating the new Reza Zarrab (R<0xC4><0x93>sa Sarraf).
Without contaminating the economy...
Burkina Faso hotel attack: 20 dead
Burkina Faso's Splendid Hotel in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, was reported to have killed at least 20 people.
Burkina Faso Interior Ministry officials said some of the security forces had found 20 bodies in the hotel’s lobby and some in the hotel’s café.
The operation, which was supported by French special forces, included the Burkina Faso Labor Minister’s rescue of 63 districts, 33 of which were wounded.
The number of hostages and assailants in the 147-room hotel is unknown.
Witnesses said the Splendid Hotel, which was preferred by more United Nations personnel and foreigners, had infested two cars with bombs outside the hotel, with a mask of 3-4 people.
Bad news from Sur: 1 <0xC5><0x9E>ehit
Police officer Ali Buluduk, who was severely wounded and taken to Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Soldier Hospital, was rescued in the Sur district, where the 46th day of the ban continued.
It was discovered that the city was registered with the Adana population.
The Diyarbakirs did not support the act of terror!
According to the information obtained, at 17.00 p.m., an action was planned against the operations in front of AZC Plaza, located in the office district of Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Yeni<0xC5><0x9F>ehir district, on Ekinciler Street.
No one participated at the desired level in the call-out action in which citizens were invited with brochures and calls.
Thousands of people participated in the actions that had been organised before, but he noted that the citizens did not support the recent actions.
The group, which did not provide a sufficient majority in front of AZC Plaza, was disbanded because they did not see support from Diyarbakir citizens.
Terrorists set fire to school in Diyarbakir
According to reports, the incident took place at 1007th Street in the Yunus Emre District.
Nuri Zekiye fled to Has High School at 7:30 p.m. after setting fire to the building by a group of terrorists with masks.
Citizens around the building reported the state of the fire on the fire.
The fire also called the police and asked for security precautions to be taken so that they could enter the area.
In addition, a large number of police teams were sent to the area with armored vehicles.
Firefighting teams coming to the school on security gains turned off the entire building without wrapping up the fire.
Then, while police teams were inspecting the scene, a multi-faceted study was initiated for the arrest of fugitive terrorists.
On the other hand, while some of the police on the scene were helping journalists take pictures, one policeman tried to prevent journalists who wanted to take pictures.
ATM robbers took over
Police teams affiliated with Izmir Security have started working on a complaint that some people have been deducted from their accounts and spent by copying bank card information.
The police found that the files of the incident were M.M.G (43) and R.O (32) and that the suspects had copied the card information of the citizens with the help of the "card copying scheme" and "mini camera" they had placed at ATMs in different years in Turkey.
The suspects who learned their card passwords were found to be dealing with these cards.
The suspects were detained with the operation.
Teams investigating the knee-jerk computer used by M.M.G. and R.O. captured a large number of video recordings of the mini-camera system set up to capture the passwords of the ATMs of citizens, while the suspects were not caught.
It was also revealed that the Zanlai earned 50,000 liras of unjust gains with their copying process on 15 different ATMs in Izmir.
The suspects, who were sent to trial after their security operations, were arrested.
Authorities warned citizens to check their account movements against such events regularly and to do hand-painting at ATMs during password entry.
Netherlands: Assad Lahey to be tried
Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said Syrian President Bessar Assad should be tried at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in Lahey.
Speaking at a conference in Lahey, Koenders said Assad was responsible for the refugee flow.
As long as Assad is in power, Koenders noted that peace will not be possible in Syria:
Assad needs to be tried at UCM in Lahey.
Someone who has so much blood in his hand must be accountable to the judge.
Assad is also the sole responsible for the refugee flow that we are currently facing.
However, I'm aware that Assad won't quit his job anytime soon.
This issue needs to be discussed first, and Russia needs help in this regard as well.
Protest against Burak Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz
In the 59th minute of the match against Medicana Sivasspor, the protests rose when Burak Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz failed to reach the goal of the pass he wanted to give to Sneijder.
Then, he turned his hand toward those who were inclined to follow him.
Then the reactions increased and protests were heard every time the ball hit the goalkeeper’s foot.
Then some tribunes supported Burak Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz and protested supporters who reacted pointlessly to their own players.
Then a large part of the tribunes supported Burak Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz.
Winner: There is no incompatibility in Celtic
While Deila admits that the Hoops are in the wrong place, Griffith doesn't care about his words of incompatibility in Celtic.
The Battle of the Hearts with Warburton's reluctance to face the punishment given to Neilson by the SFA and the January signatures that disrupted the team's unity
Leader Dons scored five points against Celtic
Adam Rooney's first-half penalty shooter brought Aberdeen a fair victory to the Dons against Hamilton in Pittodrie, and gave the Dons the opportunity to make a five-point difference between them and the Celtic.
Griffith doesn't care about his incompatibility words.
Celtic's inconsistency-creating rumors tickle Griffith's back and forth and indicate that he and his teammates have not been challenged in any way as they prepare to face the Dutch League Leaders.
I don't think we're feeling under pressure, I'm at a stage where players are impatient for it.
The lack of Scots honor race upsets the Dutch and Boer
Ronald de Boer, former midfielder of the Rangers and former internationally renowned player of Dutch football, says they have lost interest in Celtic because of the lack of competition of Dutch football fans with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an Ajax ambassador, said, "They are no longer giving out summaries of Celtic matches in the Netherlands, why?"
'Cause the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People don't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the old team.
They talk about teams, they talk about it, they talk about it.
Tension was high in the previous team matches, and those who wanted to watch those matches weren’t the only Scots.
I swear I'll fix it, Deila.
RONNY admitted that Deila Celtic was struggling, but said the Norwegian boss would go the other way around.
The defeat against Malmö, and then the Champions League, followed the loss against Aberdeen, now a five-point difference in the scoreboard.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had bad days in the past, so we'll go back."
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know the situation is very dreamy, and that a lot of people are angry or sad about what's going on.
We are in the same situation, but we have to continue.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because it makes these players feel so much better.
It's so important to stay together now.
Warburton's January transfers
Despite comments just a couple of weeks ago that he set some January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is withdrawn from signing, insisting that Ibrox does not want to break the team's unity.
The former Brentford teacher said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For the players coming in the summer, there is a pre-season period where you will practice them, we saw this in our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes it’s more damaging to add unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic Michu is targeted in retirement
His Swansea fortress Michu was tied to Celtic in the transfer window, and he squandered his predictions that he might be retired once his contract with the Rabbits ended.
At the age of 29, he had two years of irresistible pain from a troubled ankle and found no way to leave Galer for the summer.
Hearts prepare for SFA fight on Neilson's comments
When Paterson was kicked out of the game, the Hearts were 2-1 in the lead and then they lost 3-2, turning everything upside down after the defender's red card - Collum's third red card to be cancelled in eight months.
Neilson does not give up what he says, insisting: "I have never questioned unity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths tried to prevent Tynecastle
The obsessed Hibee was chanted when she sang a song about former Hearts actor Rudi Skacel with aggressive lyrics.
The event took place in March 2014 at a bar in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh ahead of the Edinburgh debacle in Tynecastle.
"It was a derby game and it was hot at that moment," the attacker added, adding, "I can definitely say that I will not go to Tynecastle unless I play with Celtic from now on.
Tannadice board trusts Dundee United's management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly is still confident that the Dundee United board of directors will fix things — but they recognize that the downturn on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the kids ready to be put on the road again," Donnely said.
Mclness is pleased with the "successful win" against Hamilton
Derek Mclness admits that thanks to Aberdeen's first-half penalty for Adam Rooney, they are desperate to hold on to the Hamilton Accies to see Celtic's seventh win over five points in the league's scoreboard.
Mclnnes said: "There's no team that wins anything without winning the match, whether it's cups or leagues in the middle."
Unemployment rates in the UK remain the same among Scots
The number of unemployed people across the UK rose to 1.82 million, while the number of unemployed people remained unchanged in Scotland between May and July.
According to the National Statistical Office (ONS), the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 percent higher than in the UK 5.5 percent.
On the other hand, employment in Scotland has fallen 12,000 in three months and the number of currently employed remains 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% - this figure is above the average of 73.5 percent in the UK.
State Minister David Mundell, responsible for Scotland, commented on the latest figures: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations of a stronger economy."
Almost a year has passed since the date when Scotland decided to remain part of Britain.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen developments in the Scottish labour market with the increase in employment and the decrease in unemployment.
Why I witnessed an execution in Oklahoma
In the next few hours, I'll be watching a man be killed because of a late legal intervention.
I hope not, but if it does, I'll be sitting in the death-room monitoring gallery at Oklahoma State Prison, executing Richard Glossip with a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
The invitation was first made through her best friend in January and I accepted no matter how shocked I was.
As that day approached, I began to be afraid of it.
So why am I doing this?
I agreed because I thought this was a good way to tell the whole story about a death penalty.
It will offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists are allowed to monitor executions in America, and there is a terrible loophole when it comes to deciding who to choose, because it is more practiced than the current places.
Oklahoma has dropped its media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever he chooses will watch him before he gets caught up in his feelings.
I can't do that.
I will sit with Richard Glossip’s closest friends and have developed a relationship with him over the past few months as a result of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I love that guy.
We laugh too often when we talk.
The authorities in the prison told me that I could not be a witness or a journalist, so I would not be given a pen and a book to record what I saw.
I'll try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist on Twitter accused me of renouncing my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes, access wins.
I complained to him.
He also admitted that "you can get it better" but he still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip disagrees with me on some of the things I say and write.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and if he did, I wouldn't accept it.
I told him when he wanted to, he could get me out of the witness list.
But an international reporter wants to be there and write it down.
If he dies, he thinks that spreading it to the public will help in anti-death action.
A reporter from the Huffington Post, Kim Bellware, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about this, please listen to the podcast series I have prepared.
I won't tell you all the details here.
I'm not sure if Richard Glossip is innocent.
What they did after the death of Barry Van Treese is enough to make him a criminal partner.
But I still believe he's not guilty of murdering himself.
I don't think there's enough evidence to justify a death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch her death from this perspective.
I can't really claim to be objective.
You can look at the other journalists there for that.
The impressions you'll get from me will be the impressions you'll get from watching the death of a man he likes unnecessarily killed.
Man Convinced From Canning River After Police Chase
The Canning Vale police officer was drought while convincing the man from the Canning River.
The claim of escaping from the police car behind a man in Perth ended with an attempt to convince a police officer to "strengthen him back to the coast."
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday over an unauthorized entry to Beckenham.
When they saw the suspect, the man tried to escape from the police entering the Canning River.
But he couldn't get too far.
"Deputy Deputy Commissioner Shandell Castledine stood in the water and said, 'I won't win, I'm not going to win.'
Police Memuru Lachlan Perhavec did not want to wet his uniform and used a safer tactic - "good police negotiation".
Deputy Deputy Commissioner Castledine said, "Sometimes people try funny things to try to escape."
Champion footballer Ben Cousins provides a lasting example in mind.
In 2006, Cousins left his car to escape a police alcohol control and swam across the Swan River.
Their efforts were unsuccessful, but they inspired locals to plan a Ben Cousins biathlon for jokes.
Peter Moody claims he was being spied out by the fans and threatened to quit the race.
Peter Moody claimed that Racing Victoria's seniors were trying to make a layout in their yards last year and threatened to leave the race immediately.
Racing targeted Victoria's mayors and unit department and said they were conducting a personal campaign against her in their last feed for the race on Wednesday before the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do the best in racing, and the job told Lidari that he found himself in conditions of power that he could not explain when giving a cobalt positive result.
He said he had been biting his tongue for 18 months in the face of spy allegations that he did not want to "look like fake grapes".
"I didn't want to say that, and I shut it down for a long time, but sometimes you're very angry and everything happens all of a sudden," Moody said.
They know it's going on.
Sometimes you react and you endure the consequences of it, and I will endure the consequences of what I say.
When I get home tonight, I'll sleep comfortably.
I want to walk my head straight and let my bosses know that I'm trying to do the best I can for them.
When they start thinking I didn't do it, I don't have to be an operator anymore.
So I thought about what I would do with my license.
Previously, Moody had exploded a bomb in an interview at racing.com accusing the unit of being spying in its own yard.
"If you were a month ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - if you ask my name - and in exchange for telling them what I was doing in my backyard, they offered him a job in my backyard," said Moody, at Racing.com.
They clearly believe that I'm a three-man.
If that's the case, they'd all have to return their nipples because they weren't talented enough to catch me.
Robert Roulston, the former president of RVL, David Moodie, the new president of RVL, and the current general manager of RVL, knew that at the time.
Should this make me think that it's starting to be personal?
RVL has a number of bullets and maybe it wants to make those outside of the operators accountable for what’s going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to get my license and throw me out, but I don't doubt what I'm saying will make them think about.
But I can't say anything at the point where I'm coming, and that upsets me.
That's really upsetting me.
I'll put pressure on them, I'll take responsibility for deciding on them.
I have my family's support and I'll walk.
The employee's long-standing cobalt investigation into Lidari and his disappointment with the subsequent cracking incident led him to say "throw my license to the front of the table".
The invincible champion Black Havyar, who won the Moody's race day care rule, described it as "funny" and said it was against the rules of throwing mud or clay to the horse's feet.
This is against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this.”
One of my men accidentally hit the wheel on his leg.
He could've taken it last night.
It could've been yesterday, which happened.
It took the race day.
Moody may face a three-month men's penalty for using a pad for the race day as a result of an investigation that the managers have opened.
That's a joke.
Those who do these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We understand that we need rules, but this has gone a long way," Moody said.
The driver who crashed into Cobram was arrested.
Police arrested a man who hit a bike and ran away at Cobram over the weekend.
The bike was taken off the air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital on Saturday morning after a car hit him on the Murray Valley Highway due to serious injuries.
Police said the hit driver fled the scene without helping the injured man.
On Monday, a 50-year-old Nathalia man surrendered to the Shepparton police station.
He is expected to be charged with not stopping in an accident, not helping, and other traffic offences.
The 40-year-old Cobram biker remains stable in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Strongly Responds to Competitors' Claims of Struggle
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy described his team's targeting criticism as an effort to "create a day" for NRL's two favorite firsts.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said Friday night that they allowed the referees to "return" with their own team in a semi-final match in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett called the game a "impatience" game for the rugby league by sending it to Storm after a semi-final match that he won against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, and said it was the "big of two Oueenslands".
Bellamy defended the team's struggle and said they focused only on "themas" while fighting.
Bellamy said that this meant they were worried that Storm would defeat them because it was powered by criticism from the two leading coaches.
"This is progressing - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about the fight when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defense systems or techniques throughout the year, we have only made a real emphasis on our combat contacts in the last six weeks, and this has been a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years and obviously has a big team he's been coaching and he's probably not used to losing with a small shock for himself.
It’s funny that this happened at this time of year.
Bellamy opposed Bennett's idea of "exciting football", reminding Bennett's teacher who won the 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons premiere by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared our game to his own games on Saturday night on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember St George being criticized for being a boring team in 2010, and Wayne said he wouldn't even give a mouse ass.
But now we have a team to play soccer, which we can call exciting football, and especially young people with speed.
This is the kind of football you will want to play when you have these types of players.
He put this point in 2010, now everyone wants to play football in this way – not every team has halfs (owners) like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so it’s not possible to play in this way.
This gives me more confidence because even they're a little shy about playing.
When they went to the big games, they probably didn't bring us to their minds six weeks ago.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm and Roosters match had a higher score than the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven’t watched it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
Our match is 20-18, the score of both sides in our match is more but exciting football?
Or is it exciting to stop the attacks, but not to do the scoring attacks?
This is my day to me.
If they're talking about us, that means we'll meet them here at the next level.
Storm, one of the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks, won no heavier weights at AAMI Park on Saturday night in the first final game on Tuesday.
Serb man released with <0x24>200,000 in bail for drug offences
The man who was caught on 40 kilograms of cocaine in Queensland and faced a possible imprisonment sentence was released for <0x24>200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five people caught last month by the federal police who tracked down the drug from a 100-pound Solay yacht landed at Coomera in South America via Vanuatu in August.
Maksimovic was seen throughout the morning at a meeting with his accomplices at the marina and later met with them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of encountering a potential impeachment penalty due to the commercial amount of cocaine, Maximovic's lawyer said that there was no evidence of his attempt to possess all the drugs and could be in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan Maximovic was concerned that there was a risk of escape.
They have open ties to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often,” he said in court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about where he was in the public case.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather offered together <0x24>200,000 to be released.
Judge Flanagan said: “It is clear that after reading both people’s sworn statements, the <0x24>200,000 bail cost actually creates a financial burden on them.”
But he warned her that this alone was not enough to stop her from going to trial.
Maksimovic was released in exchange for the day-to-day release of passports from Australia and Serbia, and for the day-to-day release of passports from the countryside, as well as for the prohibition of going to the street between 6am and 6pm.
Stevan Hogg Uses Girls' Phone to Send Pedophiles to Send Images
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while sleeping, logging into an online messaging service and provided her with a series of inappropriate children sent to her by another user.
The girl then woke up and realized she had no phone and found her phone in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She looked at him and immediately noticed disturbing messages before she warned her mother.
The police were interested and saw five pictures, then analyzed the computers in the address and discovered "related" web searches made using terms for finding inappropriate child pictures.
Hogg later claimed to officials that the reason for doing so was to “manage pedophiles on the internet” and “behave like the police and frighten them.”
Financial Deputy Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "It's an addiction - it's an addiction to fearing people.
He admitted that the calls were made by the computer, but said he did so to act like a police officer to scare the pedophiles.
Questions were asked about conversations with the stranger who sent the pictures to him and asked him to send more pictures from them.
He said he did this to punish them.
When he drank, he said he had sick thoughts and wanted to watch rape and murder scenes.
Mrs. Robertson added: “When she found the messages on her phone, she called her mother screaming and shaking and crying.
Mom saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone and came after the charges.
She was interviewed and said she was using a computer and a PlayStation to look younger than her boyfriend.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives in Dundee, was found guilty of taking or producing improper child pictures on June 14 last year, violating his detention on January 25 this year, and not attending the court on March 24 this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim said that Hogg could not be included in the category of sexual offences, as there was no dispute that there was "a definite sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the case until October, when the social work report will be given.
Hogg was released in this case with regret but was detained for other unusual cases.
Sexual offences were recorded before the date of the verdict.
In Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe made the wrong speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell off the stairs as he climbed a podium earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the fallout went viral on social media.
The opening of Parliament was stained with the claims of opposition MPs that Mr. Mugabe received anonymous death threats as they were slapped in the course of his speech.
The nation's speech in parliament last month smeared him and kept cutting off his speech - he repeated the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the leader of the Democratic Change Movement (MDC), said seven opposition politicians had sent messages to their mobile phones so that they would not disturb him during Mr. Mugabe's speech.
“After Mr. Mugabe’s speech is over, it comes from an invisible message to journalists, but it’s titled ‘death’,” he said.
He tells members that immunity is valid in parliament and that immunity does not work when they leave parliament.
The chief spokesman said he was "concerned" about the party's threats to politicians run by Morgan Tsvangirai.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard will put an end to 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in terms of reorganization and cost reduction efforts in corporate services.
HP will split into two companies listed later this year, separating its computer and printer business from its fastest growing hardware and service operations.
HP said in a statement that expected withdrawals would result in a cost of around <0x24>2.7 billion at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
Meg Whitman, the chairman and CEO of the post-separation unit, said: "These reorganization activities will provide a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Company."
“Whitman, Hewlett Packard Company will be smaller and more focused than HP today, and we will have a broad and deep portfolio that will help companies transition to the new business style.”
As a separate company, we are in a much better position than before to meet the growing needs of our customers around the world.
According to a statement from the company, the Hewlett Packard Company's annual revenue will be over <0x24>50 billion and will focus on "providing unrivaled integrated technology solutions for companies."
Its garages in Palo Alto are called "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley," and in the 1930s the company was founded by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical equipment.
HP is switching from traditional personal computers to mobile devices to a major reorganization.
This move by HP, one of the world’s largest PC manufacturers and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is one of the last moves in the industry of belief that firms with strict focus are performing better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says Wilshere is having problems with his teammates with his injury before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed that Wilshere's disability occurred in September and that his treatment was planned, there was no reason for him not to play in Christmas rows.
The best scenario is that Wilshere will definitely miss at least four games in England, and it is unclear whether Wilshere will appear to be participating in the upcoming European Championships this summer.
The most embarrassing part of the last problem is that Wilshere had a strong end last season after a separate ankle injury and then sought his old pre-season sharpness.
This type of disability is not threatening a career, Wenger said.
This is a completely unhealed bone.
It's not a big deal.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his wrists or his previous disability.
From a medical point of view, these may be true, but as Wenger will admit, there is also the danger of being further injured by a mid-season returnee.
There is also an unpleasant pattern that is developing.
According to a study by Prömier Injuries Ltd., Wilshere has had 23 different discomforts recorded since its inception six years ago.
In the last five seasons, he played only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games.
In the big picture, Arsenal is one of the two First League teams who lost most of the time in eight seasons since 2007-08.
Wenger accepts the potential for a fertile cycle, but Arsenal believes it will continue to recover from his disability record last season.
“Sometimes you experience an open period of injury when you return from a disability, a process where you want to strengthen your body and win the fight,” Wenger said.
Jack's too young to get out of it.
I hope he stabilizes his body, I trust him, and I believe he will do the career he deserves.
Tottenham Hotspur will play against Arsenal on Saturday, which will start Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, and Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, which Wenger is preparing for.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not go to Croatia, so it makes sense to play Arteta with Mathieu Debuchy.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give players the breath they need," Wenger said.
Despite being one of the open favourites of Arsenal's F Group, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most popular stadiums in Europe.
The dynamo last season did not lose 41 matches after producing its own "Nama<0xC4><0x9F>lub" campaign.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake of 3.2 magnitude on Tuesday night, according to the Richter scale.
This was the 10th earthquake in Zagreb this year.
Wenger Arsenal believes he has taken the necessary lesson from last season's defeat to Monaco in the Champions League and continues to be motivated by the goal of achieving the club's first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is huge," says Wenger.
That’s never happened in Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but I have enough experience to be realistic on the other hand.
We are passionate, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy program that gives us serious lessons about friendship between men
The lack of similar ports in programs is striking, especially at a time when men needed more to open up and the suicide rate among young men peaked at 15 years.
In 2013, this was the biggest cause of male deaths between the ages of 20-45; and it was three times more than women in men.
In order to draw attention to this problem, the Campaign for the Elimination of Sephardic Violence (CALM) declared 2015 the Year of Men and aims to counter the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
To accomplish this challenging task, friendship is at the heart of the struggle.
A study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms showed that if a person has a high number of "healthy" friends who suffer from this disorder, their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, it halves the mental difficulties that may arise in a circle of mentally healthy friends for those who are not depressed.
But, of course, it needs to be accessible first in order for friendship to work.
In this time of heavy social media communication, focusing on content rather than style makes it more priority to respond urgently rather than meaningful communication.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to look like strong, fun-loving and successful people, even if everything is in isolation.
Artificial success is under the concepts that psychologists call external impulsive values; under the domination of money, image, social status; after these, intrinsic values that have a deeper impact on our mental health - were our intrinsic lack of personal development and friendship.
As a billionaire video game creator recently revealed, money doesn’t buy more happiness.
The beauty of the series of Friends was to turn this focus point head-down.
Characters were identified, not by their works, but by their personalities; and they were revealing this by their interactions with their friends.
Joey and Chandler’s frequent cravings, the moment they watched football in comfortable chairs, Ross’s connections to Rachel all came from the knowledge that they could actually relate to them even if they were in the background to exactly explaining the feelings of men.
What an assistant told me was: "...when I listened to depressed and suicidal people, I saw how even the slightest interactions between friends could make a difference."
Most of the men who contact us don't talk to their friends.
It's a very strong feeling like "passing and going," and the idea that opening up to others is also a sign of weakness."
One of the programs that came to my mind while suggesting long-term coping mechanisms is the Friends series.
He highlighted the small moments of his friendship.
In line with my goal, a foreign status on the phone helps people when they are in trouble; but long-term support comes from family and friends with close personal networks.
And if you’re joining FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful setting where the scenes are redesigned to celebrate?
Or, better yet, if you see someone alone on Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You don’t know how your friendship will make a difference.
Friends ends at Comedy Central - all 236 episodes - <0x23>FriendsFest
Di Maria's goal made it easier for PSG to beat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrated with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his goal at Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made it easier for the Swedish team to pass the PSG in the goal to Malmö on Tuesday at the start of the Champions League.
Here's the match report and match responses.
In the match where Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani scored, Paris Saint-Germain started with a 2-0 win over Malmö in the Champions League match on Tuesday.
Di Maria became a PSG player who allowed the French champion to continue his career in the Champions League, but they couldn't evaluate Cavani's second goal in the 61st minute.
He needed to make a strong start against the Swedish champion of Paris, who was in Group A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, not only to get out of the squads, but also to make sure they improved in their quarter-final performances in the last three championships.
But the game they played when they scored wasn't the best game of the era for Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent a lot of positions around the penalty area and was later eliminated against the team of the country where he started his excellent career with him in 1999.
"Winning in the Champions League is not easy, but winning 2-0 in this regard will create problems for our competitors, and giving a comfortable image backwards is a good start, even if there are some things we need to improve during the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win even though we didn’t score one or two more goals, and we won.
After Ibrahimovic's injury, he returned to Paris with one of the three player's 2-2 changes in the weekend's match against Bordeaux in the 1st League, but remained in the shadow of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When the Argentine wing player was transferred from Manchester United last month, he was seen as a player who would bring PSG to a higher level in Europe, and who thought he was the good shot that sent Johan Wiland from the far corner in the back of the Malmö defensive by Marco Veratti.
However, everyone was disappointed while waiting for PSG to win a big win.
To take the tour, Malmö had nine international players to play off Celtic, with a five-man defensive and two midfielders, a heavy opponent remaining.
In the 34th minute, they made very few attacks, except for the skull that broke the corner that Kevin Trapp defended.
On the other hand, PSG allowed them to slow down the game with unnecessary pass and inefficient final shots, Ibrahimovic was unable to make the final move in at least five strikes in the first half, and Cavani was disappointed by the start of the second half.
However, when he came to organize his colleagues, he showed that he was more skilled, in the 52nd minute, it was the Ibrahimovic who gave up the falsified shot that Di Maria sent to Wiland's castle.
The second goal came after a full hour, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan player recorded his sixth goal of the season with the head shot from the left wing by Maxwell after the pass of Ibrahimovic.
Malmö's ideas of returning to the game were exhausted and after the uncounted gold thrown by Ezequiel Lavezzi, who later entered the game in a scoring manner, Wiland perfectly saved David Luiz's vacant seat and did not allow the score to change.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was a class superior to his own team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which is not at the same level as him.
The teams in the unit are not enough.
A hat is taken out to Paris.
It was a great match for them.
Glencore earns <0x24>2.5 billion in sales of shares
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore hit a seven-step drop in processed commodity prices and earned <0x24>2.5 billion in Wednesday’s shares as part of its split plan.
Glencore, listed in London, said it was selling new shares worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
The company, which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, was severely affected by its falling commodity prices due to China's economic slowdown on demand and the fact that it caused confusion in the markets.
The legal issue caused Glencore's stock prices to rise early Wednesday morning on the London Stock Exchange.
The shares jumped by 131.60 seconds, opening 0.69 per cent higher at the FTSE 100 index, up 2.77 per cent.
Glencore announced last week its <0x24>2.5 billion stock sale plan, which is part of its plans to reduce its <0x24>30 billion debt stack to one-third.
The company sold its new securities for 125 pennies per share, a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday's closing.
It sold its 1.3 billion shares to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about China’s long-standing growth have halved iron ore prices; coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that China's President Xi Jinping will make an official visit to the United States by the end of the month.
The statement said Xi's first official visit to Washington would take place on September 25 and a return visit to Barack Obama, who arrived in Beijing last November.
After the two heads of state talks, U.S. President Michelle Obama and his wife, Peng Liyuan, will have a dinner in honour of Xi.
The statement also stressed that "President Xi's visit, in addition to bilateral relations, will expand U.S.-China cooperation on regional and global issues, and will allow President Obama and President Xi to deal constructively with issues of disagreement."
Xi’s first visit, announced in February, is expected to go to Seattle before Washington to meet with some U.S. tech leaders, and then to New York City to attend the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are also expected to address Washington’s concerns about allegations that China is conducting cyber espionage activities, as well as some of China’s claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon says the diversity in filmmaking is irrelevant
Matt Damon protested against African-American filmmaker Effie Brown, saying there was no need to be behind the camera during a debate of interest in diversity.
In the HBO-published Project Greenlight Sunday night section, Brown cut off the words of an experienced actor while stressing that alternative views on the black main character in the selected screenplay of the project should be taken.
Damon, when we talk about diversity, you do this not in the cast of the show, but in the cast of the film, he claimed.
The shocked Brown, while the actor's comments on the Martian film continued, reacted with statements like "Hi! Wow. Okay."
Damon and Brown were brought together by the brothers Ben Affleck and Farrelly to discuss the finalists of the show.
Brown said, "I wanted to think about how people - no matter who the director was - would behave in the character of Harmony."
A single black character is a whore shot by a white chatter wire.
Dear White People's broadcaster, the finalists insisted on Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for their rights to direct the film. Damon responded that their assignments could be "unwanted".
After the debate was published, there was an explosion of displeasure with Damon's comments on social media.
MrPooni, a Twitter user, said: "Matt Damon can explain his diversity about that person as it hurts, because he talks about the only black person in the room."
After tweeting, he received 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments came when the correct racial expression in the media was at the forefront of social debate.
After being killed by a young white police officer named Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Life is Important movement has effectively encouraged lawmakers and lawmakers across the country to stop the practice of discrimination against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince talked about the move in a top-closed way as Grammy Album of the Year nominees were introduced.
Albums are important, he said.
Books and albums like black life are still important.
Recently, leaders of the Black Life is important movement published a statement in response to a question on Fox News whether or not Elisabeth Hasselbeck, a prominent personality, should be regarded as a hate group by the group.
Leaders said the network is a group of love that is important to black life.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was included in the list of artists, producers and media bosses invited to visit the Pope to discuss the identification of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not yet clear whether he accepted the invitation or whether he met with the Pope.
The American Ninja Warrior crowned his first champion
Professional rock climber and comedian Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win a <0x24>1 million prize by winning the American Ninja Warrior program on Monday night.
This race, which entered the seventh season, had never seen a competitor who could complete all stages in the blocks.
In the final of the season, Caldiero and Geoff managed to stay in the final tour of Britten.
The last task was to climb a 20-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten became the first person to complete the park during this time and thus managed to be the first athlete to complete the American Ninja Warrior's challenging stage 4; however, Caldiero won the park three seconds before finishing it.
After this difficult victory, Caldiero spoke to E!News with shock that he had won a <0x24>1 million grand prize.
Isaac told E!, “It’s great to think about it, I’ve never even made more than <0x24>10,000 a year or passed it.”
I mean, it just happened... I can't even imagine how it's going to happen... it's not going to happen.
Producer Kent Weed had a final interview with The Hollywood Reporter, and although Britten was the first competitor to finish the park, he explained why no prizes would be given.
According to the rules, money is given the fastest.
Weed said, "If you have more than one finisher, you will win the fastest finisher."
Even though money was a great reward and life changed, he also won a great reward.
I don't think you have a bad idea about it.
He's so happy that he did what he did.
He received tons of praise from his fans.
He's a great man and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone beats me, I'm glad it's Isaac."
I think if Isaac had changed his roles, he would have thought the same thing.
The American Ninja Warrior renewed the contract for the eighth season, and the shooting will begin in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers beat the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season hasn't had much fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Once one of the best in baseball, the Tigers are now in the final of the American Central League.
The Tigers, who dropped the game into disrepair on Tuesday, managed to beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins lost their chance to rise to the U.S. Second League savage chart by half the score difference between the Houston Astros.
For Detroit, even if it was for one night, it was a return to a good game that wasn’t much seen in most of the second half of the season.
Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said, "Every victory is enjoyable no matter how."
Tigers' ball shooter Alfredo Simon managed to score one in the sixth and ninth shots by showing Detroit's early attack support three times in the first two shots.
Simon (13-9) shot six 3/1 shots in a row, three of which were runs.
This was only the third-highest start in the last nine rounds.
"I just want to close the year strong," Simon said.
It's hard for the substitutes to waste every game, so I wanted to dive deeper into the game.
Tigers' select shooter Victor Martinez made three shots, and both of them ran, the first RBI he had won since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three nights of four strikes against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"She's got the shovel tight," Ausmus said.
It looked good (in the shooting training), it was already better seen in the BP as it was seen in the game, so it continued in this state of play.
At the end of the seventh stroke, the Twins, who took three runs in the right, had the best chance of getting back into the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton started his strike order by dubbing in the left field line.
Right field player Aaron Hicks was only able to make a slow shot, and Simon caught the second keyboarder BrianDozier for BlaineHardy to make a shot before lifting the left for BlaineHardy.
Mauer was the only player brave enough to go against striker Miguel Sano, who passed right-wing player Drew VerHagen in the two-run.
In the second tie race, VerHagen managed to draw third streetster Trevor Plouffe in a double-game with a pair of runners.
Plouffe's attack on the DP was the 27th time in the big league this season.
After endeavoring to secure Detroit ninth, Mauer crossed the RBI and broke up with the Tigers and approached Bruce Rondon by 5-4.
However, Sano was caught in three launches for the fifty-fifth right rescue.
Detroit took advantage of the early departure of Phil Hughes, who lost his form.
The Tigers won three runs in their first two shots against the experienced right-hander who had been away from the field for more than a month and had just come out of disability.
"Honestly, that's not the game I want to play," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable and I managed to make pretty good shots in the third shots."
When he made a successful first shot, Hushes took the second keyman Ian Kinsler out of the game.
Right-handed player J.D. Martinez left Victor Martinez alone in the first run of the game twice.
Victor Martinez competed with the runners to pass the 0-21 band in the number-making position.
The third goalkeeper Nick Castellanos followed with one shot to the right, winning another run, but Victor Martinez was fired while trying to make the third, so the threats ended.
The Tigers added in the second, with an outside pair from catcher James McCann and a midfielder from Anthony Gose winning a two-out position 3-0.
The Twins' manager, Paul Molitor, said it was "a big hit."
He didn't shoot very well, but he threw it in the right place.
The shooter Hughes made three shots that didn't bring the number until the right-handed rescuer A.J. Hinter was replaced.
Hughes was charged with three runs and four unsuccessful shots in six strokes.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez is out of the game due to the pain in the shoulder he used to throw.
In 2007, Sanchez's shoulder surgery will be examined by Dr. James Andrews.
Since mid-August, Sánchez, who has been on the disability list due to shoulder pain, was scheduled to start work on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, LHP will start with Daniel Norris DL against the Twins.
The Tigers have been 1-1 against Norris in four matches since their match on 30 July for the David Price transfer.
He hasn’t played since August 20 because of the pain on the right side.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their three-match series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA), Minnesota RHP will fight Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi wants to open the economy more to the world
On Tuesday, a group tasked with managing reforms said President Xi Jinping needed to open up more of the economy to accelerate growth.
In order to strengthen the General Reforms, at the 16th Central Leading Group meeting, the President said, "China must develop its opening policies by drawing on foreign investment expertise."
While encouraging the opening, Xi said new reforms would create a new space for economic growth, bringing new energy and vitality.
The leader group adopted a number of proposals, such as a negative list regulating market access, relaxation in border control policies, encouragement of state-owned organizations to incorporate private equity (SOE) and review of the registration system of settlers.
According to the statement, a negative list defining the prohibited sector and business branches for investment will be prepared.
The system will be phase-by-phase tested and developed with trial programs.
This is an important move, since it will give a greater role to allocate resources to the market and make the market more open by providing a legally based business environment.
The government will also allow companies to carry out their own business by easing control over companies.
The statement also states that China will examine new cross-border economic cooperation models in the border regions and introduce new mechanisms to encourage regional growth.
It will be opened to a private bed where there will be more space to open up the sectors controlled by the state.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign accommodation, and it will provide better services to them by protecting the interests of foreign-funded companies," the statement said.
In addition, the requirements for foreigners to obtain permanent residency permits or "green card" will be optimized and the application processes will be facilitated by one way.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of lawyers’ rights to practice and the education of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to a statement published after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting.
Miniature bag now very fashion-time newspaper Friday Eki
In the fashion world, the roads turn around and come in bags.
Recently, there are those who are miniaturized...
It is also possible to say that the small bags attached to the big ones attracted attention.
They say that everything is small.
I think this is true for bags as well.
At the back of the suitcase, the wind suddenly began to crawl in the opposite direction, and the bags tended to shrink.
There were small bags already, but this time they came up to us with the tiny bags of big handbags.
Only your phone, credit card and key can fit into these mini bags.
The flow beginning with Céline and Hermès spread with Prada.
The turn of bag admiration into a miniature curiosity has also affected newly released models.
Loewe presented the fun bags he prepared this season with two sizes.
Panda stands out for the most elephant-looking of polar bears and elephant-shaped bags.
The mini sizes of the large bags offered by luxury brands with the phenomena of names seem to have captured the most red carpet celebrities again.
Hermes's "Birkin" bag is one of her favorites to Jane Birkin.
Although Jane Birkin said she didn’t want her name to be mentioned with a bag in a press release, that’s how she’s in her memories.
Fashion Weeks have made the flow of mini bags more crowded.
There are also mini bags in the pods.
It is not possible to put them on your arm because they are very small.
They can be used with long suspensions with cross-sectional positions.
But in the pods, we've seen more of those long hangings wrapped around the wrists of the models.
Fendi is from those who carry the mini bag subject to a point forward.
There's a suggestion for those who don't fit in the mini bag, but also for those who don't give up.
Friendly mini bags to big bags.
How's that?
Turning mini bags into a bag that can be attributed to their grandparents.
This show, which is featured in the pods, has quickly found its reward on the street.
Let's see what else we'll see!
Skin change in the body
Turkey is at the level of competing with world brands in denim.
The experience he gained in production is now enriched with design.
Loft is one of them.
We see that black models, which used to have a few, are now starting to take their place on the shelves every season.
In the season when the blacks went so far, the specimens found their closest friend.
Leather pieces and leather detailing designs stand out as a purely denim friendly.
In general, short-circuit models called "motorbike" are on the day.
While the deep air is strong, the black pieces are finished again; the chiffon’s long blouses, brittle sweaters give the sport a stylish look.
Young people used to wear denim and want to disappear in the crowd.
It was thought to save the day.
Young people now want to carry on a piece that emphasizes style as comfortable as possible.
From this point of view, it is possible to say that Loft correctly understands the target audience with the collections and complementary pieces
Small step for Banksy, big step for "global"
The world premiere of the collection "The Art of Banksy", which brings together the works of the mysterious street artist Banksy, was held in Istanbul.
The artist is the first exhibition of the Global Karaköy building, a product of 15 years of work and the first time that 85 original works have come together.
The first exhibition of the mysterious street artist Bansky in Istanbul was opened the day before in Global Karaköy (R<0xC4><0xAB>ht<0xC4><0xB1>m Street).
The world-famous artist who concealed his identity and used his mysterious name was, of course, not at the opening.
We don't even know if he came to Istanbul.
But according to Steve Lazaridas, curator of the exhibition, Bansky is not even aware of the exhibition.
There is no situation that requires him to be allowed.
Because the way of Bansky and Lazaridas, an old friend, has left after 12 years.
Some of the exhibited works were collected by Lazaridas, and some were collected from collectors.
But there are things that Bansky's followers are curious about.
What did Banksy think of the exhibition "The Art of Banksy" where 85 works were put together?
For example, how would he get into the exhibition with a ticket (35 TL)? What if he saw the small shop created at the end of the 800-square-metre gallery area?
Would the Red Balloon Girl sound like she was printed on purses, wallets, and necklaces, that she was paying attention to the world’s wounds, such as the Cleanser, the Rose Now?
Making the exhibition of an artist with an anarchist spirit who concealed his identity as such a consumable material is a disappointment for Banksy’s followers.
It's not Banksy's style at all.
But you still get a limited number of tickets before it runs out!
The big exhibition "The Art of Banksy" for the small, globalized world for Banksy can be seen until April.
They're low, they're evil.
Let them go and dig holes.
President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an continued his reaction to the academics who signed the announcement.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an said, "These are the wrongdoers, these are the low."
Those who are with the wrongdoers are wrongdoers.
He said: "They have committed the same crime because they are with those who commit the massacre."
Instead of the explosion in Sultanahmet, Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an said, "In this action in Sultanahmet Square, which is a place of peace, which smells of history and civilization, in fact - even near the German Quarter - there are 10 Alchemists who are Al-Qaeda-Friends of Al-Qaeda in such a region.
I would like to convey my best wishes to the entire German people, first of all to the families of the dead.”
"Our fight against terrorism will continue with determination," he said.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, who continued to respond to the academics who signed the declaration, said: "I reaffirm, in particular, that the academics who have been signing these massacres are standing up against all these terrorist incidents and publishing a cover-up statement."
It's not clear to anyone that our people have a much closer understanding of who they are, that's to say, the professor in front of them.
These are the people of darkness.
These are the wrongdoers, and these are the lowly.
They have committed the same crime because they were with those who massacred.
Where will those puppies, three-year-old Mevlude, who is a martyr with her father, be put in this clash of academics?
How do they make it their conscience to be with his killers?
I invite all the judiciary, the senates of universities, to take office because of these acts contrary to our laws.
Yesterday, I said the steps to be taken should be taken quickly.
Whatever they do, they do it there.
Those who want to do politics should do politics in parliament.
But if they can't in parliament, let them go, let them dig holes, or let them go up the mountain.
I'm talking so clear and clear.

“I found 26 people while looking for two fighter boys.”
Mete Gumürhan's second documentary "Young Pehlivans", 66.
The first Turkish documentary to be selected for the "Generation Lplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival (11-21 February).
Gümürhan, originally from Edirne, but a manufacturing company in the Netherlands, explained why and how he took the documentary, which he completed in the summer of 2014.
The documentary "Young Pehlivans" will compete in the "Generation Kplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival, which tells the story of a six-year-old Massachusetts school student who aims to be world champion in the field of combat.
Young Pehlivans, the first documentary of Turkish production selected in this section, is one of the nominees for the Crystal Bear Award.
Although the birth rate is Dutch, the original director is Mete Gümürhan.
When he was a child, he listened to the oily fighting stories of his grandfather in Turkey, where he came on the summer holidays, and watched the competitions.
“There are no political problems in Turkey.”
I wanted to tell the world what else was going on in Anadolu.
"Unfortunately, the fight from our father sports is not very well known," he said, "he wants to come together with six directors and prepare a documentary project.
The project remains unsuccessful, but one day the news magazine read on the plane opens the door to another project to Gumürhan.
“We live in a sugar factory.”
The 10-11-year-old fighter, Mete Gumürhan, who traces the writing of two younger brothers, goes to Samsun, where his family lives.
The children's father won't be allowed to shoot for documentary.
Gumürhan explains how he overcomes this challenge: “I thought about what I could do all day.
Because the support could have been withdrawn from the Ministry of Culture.”
Dad was talking about a boarding school in Amasya where the kids were going.
I thought I'd go there.
When I was looking for two kids, I met 26 boys who were interested in fighting at school.
We started shooting preparations within a week and finished the permits.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We stayed in the candy factory's bedside room."
It was the most difficult language that the documentary, completed in three weeks, brought to the director.
“I didn’t know what I was going to face while I was shooting,” Gumürhan, the foreign image director and voice actor, said.
“They didn’t speak Turkish either,” he said.
Young Pehlivans focuses on the story of six of the 26 children fighters.
Raised by his grandfather and suffering from weight problems, Aaron, who is unable to take part in training because he broke his arm, Beytullah, the school’s sweetest child, Hope, the youngest champion Ahmet, and Muhammad, who is not involved in the training because he broke his arm.
Mete Gumürhan explains how she works with children: "I left them completely natural."
I just tried to use Muhammad everywhere.
I took a shot in the first week and a half of training.
My wish was that the kids behaved like they didn't have a camera.

Mete Gumürhan, who said that the young Pehlivans did not expect to be selected to the Berlin Film Festival, "We were prepared but it was a surprise to be elected to Berlin."
Young Pehlivans is not a sports documentary, but a production that tells about the struggles of children and conveys cuts from their lives.
“I wanted to bring the stories of children with family problems to the forefront of their efforts to identify and manage their problems,” he said.
Supporting academics from the art world
Following the announcement of the "Academics for Peace Initiative" yesterday, the storm overwhelming the opening of an investigation and detention of academics, on the one hand, comes with statements of support.
The first support came from a number of well-known literary names among them.
Yesterday, the filmmakers announced their support for theaters.
In a statement signed by 138 theaters, "...we stand by this honorary meeting of academics who, as artists working in the field of theater and the performing arts, are calling for peace, in which freedom of expression, equality, freedom of expression, and the right to live."
“We add our voice with our conscience and with all our heart to the call for negotiation and peace by academics.”
Among them are Sea Turkali, Atilla <0xC3><0x96>zdemiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, Rare Sar<0xC4><0xB1>bacak, <0xC3><0x96>zcan Alper, Serra Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz, Honour Famous, Ye<0xC5><0x9F>im Ustao<0xC4><0x9F>lu, Pelin Esmer, Tolga Kara<0xC4><0x9F>elik.
But without, but without, you're like, "We're not going to be partners in this crime!"
The Academicians for Peace Initiative has supported the academics, we are with them."
The Association of Film Writers (S<0xC4><0xB0>YAD) also said in a statement, "We are with the academics who have become the target of the Linz campaign."
The Academics for Peace Initiative issued a statement titled "We are not a partner in this crime" to the government, calling for peace and negotiations with the simultaneous declarations held in Ankara and Istanbul on 11 January.
In addition to the 1,128 academics at Metne 89 University, Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, Etienne Balibar, have also signed up to thinkers with worldwide renown for their theories and books.
President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an and Prime Minister Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu have harshly criticized the statement of academics in the form of "terrible support" and called upon the institutions to "do their will."
After this call, while some universities put an end to the work of academics, the prosecutor's office launched a thorough investigation.
Yesterday, a large number of academics were arrested.
My fan, please help me!
Hurrem Sultan's red hair, Beren's nose, Justin's hair...
Working like celebrities is considered to be normal to some extent, but it is seen as psychological discomfort after the point where life begins to affect completely.
Celebrity Worship Syndrome, the name of the other ‘famous worship syndrome’, has already become an academic topic in the world, and we have a newly spoken topic.
It can be considered normal for ladies to run into the salons with famous photographs of ladies.
But let's not forget the "Hurrem Sultan" year, where all the young people in Ireland have red hair.
In the 2015 aesthetic operations that we left behind, there was already news that 'Beren's nose had a headache.
The situation in front of the gentlemen is not very different.
For a while, it was advisable to dress like a Polat Alemdar.
And now the wind is blowing in the middle of it.
Justin Bieber's copy is filled with boys.
So that the unnecessary information we quoted has been read thousands of times on the Internet: "First of all, when you go to the barber, cut the sides of your hair, that is, the top of your ears and the surroundings to the top of your head."
Only the sides will be short.
After the cutting process is finished, you should shape your hair with light water.
After the shaping process is finished, tighten your hair with the help of spray.
"Justin needs to be shaped when he's wet to get his hair."
All of this, which has already become an academic topic in the world, brings to mind the newly spoken ‘Celebrity Worship Syndrome’, another ‘famous worship syndrome’.
Fans of celebrities are seen in us as kissing love.
Artists are proud of their number of fans, how much they are impressed.
Fortunately, the psychological situation isn’t that simple.
Bilhassa discusses whether young people decide on what to eat and drink, what to listen to, what to wear.
Excessive adherence to names presented as incompatible is defined as a mental discomfort to take role models.
Expert psychologist Sümeyye Eisen admits that Turkey has been left behind in studies in this field.
But it does not miss the fact that families are slowly becoming aware: "One of the fundamental issues of psychology is that a person is at peace with himself, that he is at peace within his identity."
At first, filling the children’s room with posters was not taken very seriously when someone wore a dress.
It's changing now.
He feels the need to intervene in the situation.
“A passionate attachment to someone is a sign that something goes wrong in a young person’s life.”
Fans on the Emotional Speed Train
Interest in celebrities is safe under the condition of not escaping excessively.
Iron suggests not wanting her to marry, jealous of her husband, preferring to pay attention to the signs of her dressing.
We're talking about famous people on the name.
It’s normal to be concerned about them, to be in touch with their lives.
But the teenage boys who kidnapped the canter ball when a specialist psychologist said: "In the family or in the environment, when there are no names to represent at the point of beautiful behavior, that gap certainly fills."
Good examples don’t always come out.
"He's copying the negatives, too, kid."
As we discuss how to approach them, Sümeyye Iron begins by reminding us that the famous passion syndrome is seen more in youth.
Given the fact that young people can be self-confident, the problem becomes more relaxed.
On the one hand, while complaining about the limitations of their families, on the other hand, we are faced with support and compassion awaiting young people: "We have to take into account their emotional landings."
New research reveals that they are struggling because of changes in their brains.
"It's also natural, soft approach to connecting passionately with a young person on an emotional speed train."
It is possible to change behaviors
Expert psychologist Sümeyye Eisen recalls the tasks of his parents to overcome the famous cult syndrome:
Recognize her emotional distress, make sure you are calm before you get into the matter.
Never let him suppress his feelings.
Make sure you respect her admiration to promote her independence. . . .
Show a good example, instead of teaching, discuss the names of the role model.
Try to take on the place of celebrities in our daily lives together.
Reading books that tell the real world of celebrities together will work.
Definitely turn your communication into a form of adulthood.
Remember that addiction and motivation use the same pathways in the brain.
Share with your child that mistakes are an opportunity to change, accept them as they are.
Be sure to get expert support on fanaticism.
The one who is angry, the one who is jealous, is admired.
Based on the Celebrity Worship Syndrome, Meditation needs to be hoped for and helped by others.
Unhindered love is actually a call for help.
But unfortunately it's not perceived like that.
Moreover, this problem is so widespread that it is not possible to limit it to a country or continent.
Dr. Recai Yahyao<0xC4><0x9F>lu points out that there are certain names in every country that are busy with television.
Syndrome shows itself more by attaching to these celebrities: "They're unusual."
The majority of them don’t have their chances.
Those who do not have will not be able to live like them.
Either they don't accept it or they don't dare.
“But those who don’t have the opportunity, if necessary, continue to watch with the nerve that they can’t live like them.”
It doesn't really matter who's jealous or who's staring out of their nerves.
They both feed on admiration from within.
They make money effortlessly, they're on the magazine's agenda.
Even knowing that is enough to increase his fanaticism.
Another advice of the expert Psychologist Sümeyye Eisen is to question the reality of those lives at this point.
It should not be overlooked that physical lives are the subject.
The support of the environment for the person who has a passion for celebrity comes into effect here.
But the person insists that his reputation as a fan admits that he has problems like himself.

Should I have a bladder surgery? - Family - Health News - Time Magazine
Dr. Fevzi <0xC3><0x96>zgönül answers questions in the corner of Meydan Gazeti.
I have stones in my intestine and every morning when I get up, I go to the toilet with my stomach pain after meals 2 or more times a day.
Could this prevent me from losing weight?
I'm starting to use alkali right now, but my appetite doesn't decrease, I can't lose weight at all.
It's been like this since I was a kid.
What am I supposed to do?
Do you think I should have a bowel surgery?
CEVAP: The bladder is often accompanied by an infection.
This abdominal pain, which develops immediately after eating, is also a sign that when you eat, you have a bladder of the intestine and empty the inflamed intestine.
The intestines, which are uncomfortable due to inflamed bowel, quickly try to throw this bowel out.
That’s why you often go to the toilet.
As you often go to the toilet, your food is thrown away without digestion and your weight loss slows down.
I think you need to cure this.
If you go to a gastroenterologist and the condition I said is detected, you can get rid of it using antibiotics.
But in the end, you may also need to have a bladder surgery.
Alkaline probiotics can slightly reduce these complaints, but they won’t.
I'm telling you to keep using the probiotic, whatever it is.
Because the biggest help to lose weight is this probiotic powder.
I eat a lot when I'm stressed.
When I am stressed and nervous, I eat myself and lose weight.
How can I handle this?
CEVAP: Excessive food cravings actually mean that the energy need is not fully met.
This can be due to having little to eat or skipping your morning and lunch meals.
Another reason is that you don’t eat the food you eat.
For this, your digestive system needs to work healthy.
If you have a ulcer, reflux, or a similar problem, the easiest way is to take a good probiotic medication.
You will see the benefit more.
I can't lose weight, doctors don't know why.
In your corner, there is often information about weakening.
It makes sense to me, too, but my situation is a little different.
I don't get any weight.
Most importantly, I don't know why.
The doctors don't say anything.
CEVAP: The techniques we apply are to turn the body back to its ideal dimensions by restoring the body’s physiological work rather than weakening.
Weakness is the same type of discomfort as obesity.
Without losing weight in obesity, not gaining weight in weight loss is treated with the same technique.
When you eat sweet and sour foods, you will become even weaker.
I guess you've understood that so far.
You can also be stimulated by carboxypunktur and gain weight with a healthy diet.
So you've gone away from your ideal body.
Our other patients have gone away from their ideal bodies as well.
You will reach your ideal body by gaining weight, and they will achieve by losing weight.
If the system eliminates the problem, you will gain weight, they will also lose weight.
First of all, the system needs to work properly.

A child who feels unworthy is drowning in hatred
There are some emotions that are born in a person’s sense world.
Fear, sadness, happiness, wonder, anger, anxiety...
But feelings such as hatred, kinship, revenge occur in children over time and as a result of some wrong attitudes.
Every person needs to be an individual, including the age of childhood.
That is, you should respect your parent’s or social environment decisions, ask for an idea on matters of interest to them, and feel that it is valuable.
Providing these forms the basis for the formation of a healthy personality.
For example, behaviors such as deciding instead of the child on matters of interest (what to wear, what to eat), not recognizing the child’s wishes, and instead rectifying his or her own truths (when the child wants to go to a football course.
The child who is disrespectful of his self and his existence has lost his freedom to be himself, and the defense mechanism exudes a sense of anger and hatred to protect him.
"Because, in fact, it's the opposite of acknowledging anger and hatred," says psychologist Hilal Arslan, who tries to tell her and her surroundings that the child is not acknowledging what he is doing to himself.
The expert psychologist, stating that the child does not accept the situation and react in this way as a positive development in terms of personality development, said, "This hatred means 'I'm here,' it serves the purpose of protecting the child's respect for himself."
“If the child is allowed to be an individual, hatred disappears.”
The child seeks to protect himself by taking refuge in anger and hatred
Arslan, who said that at a young age, both physically and mentally, at the most vulnerable times, the parents of the children were not aware that the presence of the child was not ignored by negligence, nor did it appear that the child could be exposed to negative emotions by his or her surroundings.
Arslan goes on to say: "Sometimes it's not just emotionally satisfying their needs (don't shave, don't hug, don't kiss, don't care for school or other needs), sometimes it can also be physically satisfying their needs (eating, drinking, nurturing, schooling, etc.).
What a hateful attitude to this anger is an upbringing that opens the door.
In emotional and verbal violence, there are behaviors such as humiliation, insulting, underestimating, insulting, giving unnecessary and severe punishments, feeling worthless, yelling.
These behaviors touch a deep place because they are directed towards the child’s personality.
"The child either loses the respect he has for himself by accepting these, and spends his life feeling unworthy, unlovable, and inadequate, or seeks to protect himself by escaping anger and hatred."

Romania's budget for the elections is going to be transparent
A new bill is being drafted to determine the full source of the money used in elections in Romania and to put a maximum limit on spending.
The government wants the people and companies who sponsor politicians in the elections to be made more transparent about the money they make.
The bill also provides for the ‘decision money’ used in the elections to be preceded.
In fact, the money that each party or person will spend on election propaganda must be spent on a bank account.
All the money spent in this way can be checked more transparently and regularly by the Romanian Election Commission (AEP).
It is also planned to set a limit on the cost of the project.

Attacks on journalists in Turkey have become commonplace
Prior to Prime Minister Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu’s visit to London next week, 25 famous writers sent a joint letter to Prime Minister Cameron, Turkey.
PEN-member writers asked Cameron in a meeting with Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu to schedule a return to press and expression freedoms in Turkey.
The UK’s leading writers, by sending a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, asked his spokesman, Ahmet Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu, to report back on the press and freedom of expression in Turkey during his visit to London next week.
The 25 writers of the International Writers’ Union (PEN) are among them, including the presidents of England, Wales and Scotland; in a letter he expressed serious concerns about "unprecedented pressures on freedom of expression in Turkey".
Journalists, writers and publishers are warned that threats and physical attacks are now becoming commonplace; the attack on Hürriyet Gazeti’s offices reminded the Koza Silk Media Group, for example, of pressure and handing over.
Among them, Tom Stoppard, Ali Smith, Ian Rankin, and three journalists who worked for Vice News were arrested in a letter from authors who were also a member of the PEN, including Elif Shafak.
In the case of MIT TIRs, the arrest of Can Dündar and Erdem Gül in the investigation phase is also a source of concern, noting that "journalists in Turkey carry out their original duties in society, limit their public life, and follow the rules of censorship."
He noted that attacks on journalists, writers and publishers violated the freedoms of all Turkish society.
He stated that because of the widespread “culture of immunity,” journalists and writers have been exposed to methods of surveillance ranging from physical attacks to physical attacks.
The authors pointed out that the number of Turkish citizens charged with insulting the president's rights has increased, and since Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was elected in 2014, he has opened more insulting cases than any of his predecessors.
The words of Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu remain in the
While the Prime Minister, Ahmet Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who is scheduled to visit London next week, said he was one of several government members who expressed support for press freedom, the words did not turn into action.
In the letter, "Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu's visit to London is therefore an important opportunity to clearly undertake freedom of expression in Turkey."
The authors asked Cameron to appeal to Prime Minister Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu to ensure that the government respects Turkey’s obligations to freedom of expression.
25 authors signed in the letter:
Monica Ali, Alan Bissett, William Boyd, Chris Brookmyre, Gillian Clarke, Drew Campbell (Scotland PEN President), Fflur Daffydd, Stevie Davies, Menna Elfyn (Galler PEN President), Moris Farhi, Maureen Muureen, Tomhdon Freely, Maureen, Markhdon, Tomhdon, Hariri, Robert Gwyn,
