The city of Juankoske is associated with the city of Kuopio in early 2017.
The Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the alliance on Monday.
The Juankoske City Council approved the alliance last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the investigation of the municipality, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide on the implementation of the following municipal elections separately.
The next municipal elections will be held in 2016.
Since Juankoske's accession, the population of Kuopio is about 111,000.

Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the Kiev leadership of refusing direct political talks with the separatists in eastern Ukraine.
At the moment, the Kiev leadership does not want to conduct an essential political debate with the eastern part of its country, Putin said, according to the news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, who Kiev and the West say are aided by the Russian army, were trying to push Ukrainian troops further away from their current locations, where Putin said Ukrainian army troops were shooting civilians.
The goal of the militants is to push out these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not have the opportunity to shoot the people in the area, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at Ryrm<0xC3><0xB8>rm<0xC3><0xB8>rjaamom.
It was surprising that the crowd came from the very beginning.
Visitors were expected within two days, promoter Tom Kangas says.

In Finland, a law comes into force on Tuesday that restricts the acquisition of materials suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
Subsequently, individuals must seek permission from the Police Department to buy or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as the so-called starting material for explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them, if the specified concentrations are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is present, for example, in cleaning and detergents, but concentrations generally do not exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, during acceleration.
However, prior to the entry into force of the law, raw materials may be kept in possession and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster accused of Nairn and Pitlochry hotel raids
The defendant is awaiting trial for the rape in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges in a hearing in the High Court of Glasgow.
He was charged with rape at the Pitlochryn Scotland's hotel in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
Webster is accused of assaulting a woman “when she is unconscious, asleep, and thus unable to make a decision on her own”.
Webster is also charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Upper Nairn on May 4, 2014.
In accordance with the judgment of Judge Lady Rae, the trial will be held at the High Court in Edinburgh on 17 November.
Super Raheem glittered - Mario remained in the shadows - Super Raheem glittered - Super Raheem glittered - Super Raheem
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again pointed out why he is considered the future of English football.
White Hart Lanella had an electronic atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, reinforced by Mario Balotelli, arrived as a visitor to Tottenham.
Super Mario’s first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw the 24-year-old Italian on the field working in a completely different attitude than in the days of Manchester City.
Balotelli was still a long way from his peak.
The Italian lost three high-quality painters and fed only half of his sixteen feeds to his own team.
The pool fans who have already taken the player’s favorites expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers put Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who traveled to Barcelona, as the team's second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
The team's star instead of Balotelli was Raheem Sterling's midfielder, who knocked out the 3-0 win over Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine with his powers.
The ballotellia is 20 centimeters shorter than the fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who climbs the grass at its best at a speed of about 34 kilometres per hour.
Rodgers also deserves a lot of appreciation for Sterling’s development.
After the match, the North Irishman said that Liverpool has systematically developed a more complete squad player than a North Londoner who grew up at Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was chosen as the winner of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Council has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkin as the next Superhero of the Helsinki City Orchestra in autumn 2016.
The Los Angeles Times has asked which orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she is starting her new job with joy and pride.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a key role in our country’s music life for over a hundred years, including performing a large number of Sibelius music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many orchestra members in the past.
I look forward to our future cooperation,” he said.
Management of payee organisations in the field of pension negotiation - Home - Regions - News - Karjalainen
The pension negotiations today seek a new impetus from the own meetings of the labour market organisations.
In the morning, the administrations of SAK, Akava and STTK will discuss the negotiating situation.
After that, the actual pension negotiations are expected to continue.
The labour market organisations have been disputing, among other things, the commitment of the retirement age to life expectancy.
Organizations have promised a work solution by autumn, but according to the latest estimates it would be born during this week.
Fast-forward.
Women's Volley, Rovaniemi women's volleyball team competed in the final of the training tournament in Pihiputa on Sunday.
Vampula turned five in one of the draws to a 3-2 win.
The last batch WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was always one step ahead.
The battle was good, but in the defense and passport game Vampula was a bit better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVon's hexagon was so huge that 190-center American centerpiece Jennifer Keddy was stuck in the back.
Sara Niemi played in the Sentry.
Karolina Kyllönen, despite her inches, was playful and formed the most powerful combination of WoVo with Johanna Pekkarisen.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a hacker, was able to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 sets.
The best part of the vampire was the skilled Russian passporter and liberal Hillaelina Hämäläinen, whom WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo’s preparations will continue over the next week when Hämeenlinna HPK arrives at the training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet at the "shop" on Saturday at 6 p.m. in the official training game.
On Sunday, the school will be rehearsing.

The company has more than 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more common in rarely populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released the video in honor of her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia are more at risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers reviewed the patient data of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% of women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer more than five years after the diagnosis.
Major researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in a few populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
READ MORE: New Drugs May Slow Lung and Ovarian Cancer
Researchers went through the history of women’s health for seven years.
According to doctor Susan Jordan, the woman’s age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socioeconomic status also influenced the chance of survival.
In older women and with cancer, the probability of surviving at the time of diagnosis was the lowest.
Women living in rarely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to find out why women living outside the city are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment as possible.
“Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly located in major cities,” Jordan says.
While remote-service treatments are increasing and the importance of distance is decreasing, in addition, the researcher suggests increasing the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programs to support patients away from home.
According to a study by Dr. Jordan, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of their geographical location, which underlines the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
The study, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer charity, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old family member living on the Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen its location in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the hotel Pohjanhov.
The city council decided on Monday that the proposed position of the Friendship Park and its surroundings will be placed on the public viewing point of Osviitat.
The draft proposal is requested by the Committee on the Environment and the Centre for Living in Lapland.
With the help of the change in housing, the city wants to enable the continuation of motorcycle traffic related to tourism in the area.
The site is intended to form a park area, which includes the area between the current Friendship Park and the area between it and the river.
During the period from 15 November to 30 April, up to 200 motorcycles will be permanently delivered on the premises.
Tanking points may also be placed in the designated area.
The new park area is also allowed for maintenance transport.
The city of Rovaniemi has rented the area of the Friendship Park to safari companies for motorbike use during the winter.
The lease agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and the agreement is valid until spring 2018.
The clock-parking activity and the change of schedule have also sparked resistance to loud noises.
Residents of the neighbouring apartments have been in their hustle and bustle for both their voice and their concerns about emissions.
However, emissions in the region have been investigated and no findings beyond the indicative values have been made in the reports.
The refurbished fleet is also less polluting than the old one.
The Friendship Park as a parking lot also supports the fact that if the departure point was moved further away, the hotel’s safari customers should be transported to the safari departure points by buses that are estimated to be 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area of the Friendship Park and its surroundings are also large enough for the villagers, better than the places presented as substitutes, such as the guest of the boat boat boat on the east side of the Ounas River Bridges.
The Friendship Park is good for its location, for example, because the activities can be extended to the Ounaspaviljong region in the future.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of the city strategy adopted by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the city aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business by booking sufficiently high-quality areas logistically and functionally in favourable places.
The Friendship Park has also been marked as the starting point for motorcycle tours on the town hall, which has not yet taken effect.
Decrease in ownership of apartments in garden shops
The decrease in the number of homeowners, especially in the group of under 35, could lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden logs by tens of millions, as today's young consumers reach the "main target" group of garden sales for their age.
According to a report by the Financial Times, homeowners only spend 55% of the money used by homeowners for gardening.
The study also found that more and more people live in highly urbanized apartments with no gardens. In addition, the size of the garden decreases as the front yard is increasingly covered into a parking lot. Also, these factors threaten the garden area, which is estimated to be 5 billion pounds.
In the London metropolitan area, housing ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, and gardening products are used at the lowest per household in the country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), increasing housing rentals or decreasing the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
RHS chief gardener Guy Barter says that "for example, plants grown in transferable cultivation dishes are particularly popular among tenants because such cultivation dishes can be included in the change if necessary."
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were a period of flourishing resale in the garden sector, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will grow this year due to better weather conditions, worse than last year's weather in March and April.
Turkey to interrogate U.S. diplomat over spy report
Turkey's foreign ministry has invited the country's most experienced U.S. diplomat to present a report on the spying by the U.S. and British in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said a U.S. Embassy spokesman and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and The Intercept have written that documents leaked by former US National Security Agency (NSA) analyst Edward Snowden reveal Turkey's presence in the United States and the United Kingdom's main services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan undermined the importance of the report, saying that all the major states have been spying on each other.
A previous report on the espionage targeted by the German main intelligence service in Ankara sparked an angry reaction by the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze to appear in new Finnish film
The Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, who has appeared in several successful films, is starring in a new Finnish film.
Croze plays director Mikko Kuparisen in the film Two Nights in the Morning, which films begin this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the award for Best Actress at Cannes Film Festivals for her role in the 2003 film Barbarians Invasion.
He has appeared in Steven Spielberg's Munich film and Julian Schnabel's in the glass hood of Perhone.
The main character in the movie Two Nights in the Morning is Mikko Aufiainen.
The film will premiere in Finland in September 2015.
Majorcan police chief Magaluf accused of corruption
The demonstrators of the incident provided evidence of the police and Calvian municipal government officials' extortion in the Majorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvia, on the holiday island of Mallorca, has been arrested following corruption allegations made by traffic and bar owners in the Magaluf area known for celebrating the wet.
Commissioner-General José Antonio Navarro was imprisoned after several owners of Punta Ballena Street filed allegations of corruption against him, and most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located on Punta Ballena Street.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, those who filed the case presented evidence of the police and Calvian municipal government officials' coercion in the Mallorcan Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Spanish National Card has detained two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and they are being interrogated by the judge together with Navarro.
The nation-wide newspaper ABC wrote about the angry bias of nightclub owners by the authorities, which significantly hampered their business.
“It’s not about money anymore, it’s about survival,” a business owner told the court.
You're not destroying our livelihoods.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was featured in magazine headlines in several countries this summer, when a YouTube video was released online, in which an 18-year-old British vacationer had sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the authorities of the island have attempted to curb the drunken and uncontrollable use of Magaluf vacationers by reducing the number of participants in the famous, alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse Root, in which the oral video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the owner of the nightclub and the pub crawl organizer Carnage was ordered to be fined a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000.
Especially among young British tourists, the popular tourist destination of Magaluf has also become popular with the so-called balconing trend, which has caused several alcohol-related accidents when people jumped from the balcony to the other or from the balcony of the hotel pool.
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer at a bombing site when rockets and grenade launchers bombed their communities in the 50-day Israeli-Hamas war, and schools remained closed as the area recovered from fighting.
The opening of the schools brought joy and excitement to the rocket-bombed communities in southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting are still visible.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees at the Pashosh nursery removed traces of scissors from the walls and slides before the children arrived at the nursery when a rocket struck.
“We’re a little scared but also excited,” says Ronit Bart, who lives in Saad’s Kibbutz, an Israeli community, and works as an English teacher at the city’s school.
Many children living in this area are in dire need of routines.
The 11-year-old daughter of Bart, Shani Bart, said the return to school in a long time would feel "a little strange".
“Sometimes we’ve had difficult times when we didn’t leave home anywhere,” he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border, offering his support.
Before last week’s ceasefire, thousands of people in border communities such as Saad had stayed indoors or left their homes in safer areas farther away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza Strip are suspicious of the return of a 4-year-old boy killed by a Palestinian grenade in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, 10 families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have been placed in alternative schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a town near the Gaza border that was the subject of a heavy Palestinian invasion.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that “children’s education and safety will be taken care of.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on a cease-fire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately halted the fighting, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas’ demand for the removal of Israel and Egypt and the reopening of the air and seas of Gaza.
Israel wants to remove the weapons of Hamas and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers who have fallen in the war.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disagreed with the number of deaths, saying that at least half of those killed were soldiers, although there was no conclusive evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades at Israeli cities mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, in turn, carried out more than 5,000 free attacks and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to shelters to over 100 UN schools, which had been converted into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still on the run and continuing the fighting, the school authorities postponed the start of the school last week.
"I hope that the school will open soon and we will be able to return to school, just like the rest of the children in the world and just like the Jewish children," said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in a safe school in Gaza.
According to the commonly used meter, housing prices have risen the most in the seven-year period during the winter months of Australia.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index, which measures housing prices in the Australian capital, rose by 1.1 per cent in August, according to RP data on Monday.
With the rise in prices in June, July and August, the total increase was 4.2%, which is more than in the same months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen consistently across the country.
According to RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the forefront of rising prices.
RP Data’s results show that housing prices rose 16.1 per cent in Sydney and 11.7 per cent in Melbourne the previous year.
The housing market in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is next to be the busiest, with an average price increase of 5 to 6%.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose only 1.4% a year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring began in Australia to increase the number of homes on sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
“Given the increase in auctioned housing sales, the generally vivid sales rate and the continuing low interest rate, it is likely that housing prices will continue to rise over the next three months,” Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has attracted record-breaking audiences
The new museum and fine arts have attracted record-breaking audiences this summer in Mänt<0xC3><0xA5>.
By the end of August, the Serlachius Art Museum had more than 70,000 visitors.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and features classical works of pop art by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.

These figures are not used to.
People have been knocked out doors and windows,” says Pauli Sivonen, director of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors throughout the year will be close to one hundred thousand this year in the Serlachius museums.
In previous years there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mäntta-Vilppula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen reminds us that new museums are always opening up phenomena.
“The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent,” he says.
We hope that the art period will continue for a long time in the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
Police are investigating four robberies in Kajaan in the last few days.
On Sunday night, a window broke into a commercial property in North Lancashire.
The author had received a small amount of money from the cashier.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel was stolen from the tank of the truck in Deepäojankadu.
From the port of the deceased, the boat was again transported between Sunday and Monday with its trailer engines.

Missing amphetamines lead to murder in Kajaani
The disappearance of 10 grams of amphetamines led to the murder of a Canaanite man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to the apartment with his wife and another man and shot a 34-year-old Canaanite woman, the owner of the house he suspected was a drug exporter.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that the other man was the shooter.
The incident came to the attention of the police when the police stopped a passenger car with a companion burning the clothes used in the bloodshed.
In addition to the burnt clothes, the car was found with a broken wreckage.
The Court of Appeal shall issue a judgment at a later date.
August was rarely warm in many places.
According to the Meteorological Institute, an equally warm August repeats on average once every ten years.
Statistics from the Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature was higher than usual throughout the country.
In most of the country, the deviation was from one to two degrees.
Due to the heats of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the whole summer was measured in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says: My father never hated me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born to a seven-year-old immigrant family from Jamaica, Dudley, in the British Midlands, in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory, and Henry died at the age of 19, and the relationship between his son and father was distant.
Henry is currently practicing for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father, developed on the basis of the Radio 4 channel series.
Soundtracks are a mix of reggae and rape in upbeat times.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy many times since his mother's death, and he thinks a lot about his father's relationship.
My dad was very hard to read.
His face never appeared, only a voice said, “Stop whispering.”
Leave your sister alone.
Go! Go!
I'm watching cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the form of beer learning or the beauty of cricket.
I've never talked to him about things like that.
For most of my life, he was the smiling man in the corner reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metallurgy in Dudley, gaining a sense of what his father’s life had to be like, although working conditions are now better than they were then.
The melting pots are a little lighter nowadays, but they are practically dark, smokey, labyrinth-like depths, where flames, smoke and smog come to mind.
Dad used to go to the bath and just to the ground when he was breastfeeding, and slowly he began to sing to himself while washing the melting pot dirt away from himself.
As I walked around the melting pot, I realized that he had been doing that work for years to get us food at the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Despite Henry’s childhood, the closeness offered by his parents was lacking.
My dad never hated me and never said he loved me.
It was only when my mother got sick a little before she died that we started talking to each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter Billie with Dawn French, and through his own child he has been able to share the love that he lacked as a child.
Do you have to repeat "I love you" all the time?
Stop the hail! Stop the hail!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom
Henry is still a good friend of French, with whom he has been married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why don't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to my mother’s death.
When I began to suffer from a lot of overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to do a full conversion.
After that I started to exercise a lot, and I also had to start a strict diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult -
and boring.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's famous, short-sleeve perhaps depicts his shift during his career development.
Having received a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he has drown in making theater.
The next round was the comedy Erehdys and August Wilson's Fences ("Help").
Making the theater offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry began working in the field when he was only 16 years old.
A disk driver spotted him on stage doing imitations and contacted the New Faces Qualifications Competition.
Henry’s TV career began in the mid-1970s. “How long have I been the only black imitator and comic on TV,” he says.
Henry learns how to work.
I had to grow up in a public lighthouse, I had to learn how to produce jokes from the slippery slope between 1975 and 1985, while I was starring and being on TV.

Henry's manager had the play rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show where people appeared as blacksmiths, so Henry ended up as a comedian on the show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I will not regret it.
Although my position was strange and disgusting, I was able to work on huge events and learn how to deal with the audience.
Yet "British TV's award-winning, multi-annual favorite and light entertainment program" was at the same time "a bold parody of black people".
Henry worked in another comedy series in the 1980s, both spoiled and admired the black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was featured in 1984, and in the 1990s, Henry was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
The following decade, Henry spent ads, documentaries, TV series, and movie parts, but after his 2008 LennyHenry.tv series on the BBC, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len - now it looks like you're just tracking down your site or tracks."
The next round was the Radio 4 documentary series "What's So Great About...?".
The first part was Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was actually not taught to us at school properly, and I think it belonged to a white middle class who wore socks and had money.
That's why Shakespeare aroused fear in me.
All of the people we interviewed on the show – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, “Try.
Don’t give up the whole idea until you know what you’re talking about.
Meet the words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry put out 20 strings of Othello's last speech for the documentary, and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It almost felt like some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
"That's what it's about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your sack, do a little background research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was implemented.
The show was finally a success.
Apparently it was expected to fail, but it didn’t really happen.
Shortly thereafter, Henry starred in the comedy Erehdys.
All of a sudden, I played in the British National Theatre, and I couldn’t really believe it was true.
At one point, I thought, “Oh, you’ve changed.”
Once in the theater, there were technical problems, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
“A little voice in my mind said to me, ‘You’ll have to be 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.’”
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would continue as soon as the problem was corrected.
I walked out of the stage, and some of me hugged for relief.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
"You're part of the play, stay in your role"
Henry "Fences" at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the phrases for the Fences play was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more resilient.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you have to do."
Of course, Henry says this with a HUGE voice.
So I decided to stay here.
I sincerely love this job.
I love the training rooms.
However, Henry is still basically a comedian: little humorous boys constantly interrupt our conversation as he switches from imitation to imitation.
Abstaining from the stand-up comic is a matter of will, as getting immediate thanks from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you constantly thirst for it, it can lead to swelling.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time at Apollo Theater when it feels like it, but in general it no longer inspires me the same way as before.
I'm asking Henry if he's going to go on another stand-up tour again.
It brings me real joy to sit down with a director who helps to edit the beginning, middle and end of the entire journey, and I don’t think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like the show...
It's really fun.
The show is constantly telling a story, and I am having fun with it.
I love stories.
People love stories. They love stories.
Kenya sets records of officials to remove 'fury workers'
Kenya has begun to create a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove "harm workers" from government payrolls.
Employees who did not register within the next two weeks would no longer be paid, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid their salaries after they leave office.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to break up with public sector corruption after taking office in 2013.
Earlier this year, according to the audit, at least <0x24>1 million a month was spent on wages and other financial abuses of “harm workers”.
The government suspects that salaries will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left office, BBC Wanyama Chebusiri reports from the capital Nairobi.
All officials will be required to register themselves in the identification centres in the coming weeks to ensure that their information is stored in a biometric registration form, the government said in a statement.
According to the notice, anyone who fails to do so without due cause will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will significantly rationalize the public sector, because it defines how many people actually work in their tasks. In addition, it will clean up salaries at both levels of the government. This will solve the problem of the "refugee workers" in response," said Mrs. Anne Waiguru, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Foreign Affairs.
The result of the 2015 financial year could remain a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25.5 million deficit unless the city adapts to its activities and expenditures in a pressing economic situation.
Based on the current budgetary preparation, the year-on-year deficit is around 9.4 million.
Possible ways of improving the scope and level of services were the reduction of services, the purchase of services, the sale of assets and subsidies, and the increase in tax and payment revenues.
The investment target of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million is 8.5 million.
There is no relief to the situation of the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, the insufficient growth in tax revenues, the increase in unemployment and the cut of 5% in government contributions will further undermine the prospects.
The aim of the economic seminar is to find new ways of balancing the economy.
The City Council agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be turned into a strategy-oriented goal, says the chairman of the city council, Kimmo Heinonen.
The municipality has returned the proposals for further preparation of the management group.
The proposals of the municipal government will form the basis of the budgetary debate at the budgetary seminar of the Board of Directors in Fram on Monday, September 8.
After the Senate seminar, the budget proposal is passed through the board of directors to the municipal government and the municipal authority.
Dozens of Turkish police detained as suspects of "drinking" against government
A total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of "anti-government charges", local media sources say.
The police did not comment immediately.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, there were 14 high-ranking police officers among the detainees.
Some of the police were involved in last December’s corruption investigations involving government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organising a large-scale crime and tracking phones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as Prime Minister at the time) said police actions were part of Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen’s planned action against him and other in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September is not celebrated in every school.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole of the vast Ukrainian oppression, must fight for peace.
Aleksa Pastukhov, who serves as a leading teacher at Slaviansk School, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter is visiting, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back here and that children will be able to learn something that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school traditionally include children’s printed shirts, balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
According to Perry in Texas, the tweet was unauthorized.
Texas Governor Rick Perry's confirmed Twitter account posted a blurring image of a Democratic District Attorney in the middle of hearing charges of abuse of power on Sunday night.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore that he had nothing to do with the picture.
The Tweet was unauthorized from my account.
“I don’t accept the tweet and I’ve deleted it,” the post said.
Perry’s backing troops did not immediately respond to clarification requests.
Although the tweets were posted from Perry’s confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet included a stunning photo of Travis, a District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of driving drunk in April 2013.
Perry blocked Lehmberg's funding when he refused to resign, leading to a large jury meeting in Austin this month with Perry being charged. Perry is a possible candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The tweet’s headline read, “I don’t always drive drunk, three times the amount of proms allowed... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing his finger.”
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office did not conduct a large jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antioch who was commissioned by the Republican judge.
Perry has said he is innocent and has called the charges politically vicious.
His influential legal team has asked the prosecutor to dismiss the charges and said that the law on the basis of which the Governor of Texas is the longest in office is unclear, mirrored against the Constitution.
Perry cut <0x24>7.5 million in government subsidies to a state-owned non-violent unit operating in Travis County to handle public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry’s decision prompted a left-wing follow-up group to file a formal complaint.
Perry’s confirmed Twitter account is updated regularly – and sometimes even famously.
When he reached fifth place in Iowa's 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to stop playing in the balance by tweeting a picture of himself riding on a lake with the text "Here it comes, South Carolina!"
Berkeley says the housing market is “normal”
One of London’s most important builders has warned that the housing market in south-east England has “return” to a normal level of activity.
London’s housing capital has been hampered by huge demand and sharp price rises while being frightened by the widespread credit bubble, which led the Bank of England to impose restrictions on housing loans in June.
High-level Berkeley founder and chairman Tony Pidgley said on Monday that "since the beginning of the current financial year, the market and the number of trades have returned to normal since the peak of 2013," adding that this has enabled a "stable operating environment".
London’s housing market went well during the recession, with foreign investors striving to reach the capital.
According to the register, housing prices in the city rose 18.5 per cent in the previous year alone, clearly above the average of 6.7 per cent in England and Wales.
Average sales prices for private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose by about a fifth in the previous year, reaching a price increase of <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London's property less attractive in recent months - some of the interest has also been affected by new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "mapping tax" before the May general election.
London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April housing loan report, which reported more stringent lending orders, would lead to a lower level of market growth both in terms of real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed that the amount of loans approved fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
In 2015, the real estate agency Hamptons International predicted that the prices of real estate in London will fall by 3%, as the index, which measures the prices of real estate owners, has already begun to decline.
The number of stores in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen in a quarter of a year ago, real estate broker WA Ellis says.
The demand for homes in the capital, however, is a blessing for Berkeley, which raised revenues from properties sold to over <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed, right-of-the-line product at the best locations has remained stable, and therefore sales have remained vibrant".
In June, the company reported that it sold 3,742 new homes in April, which is almost a third more than at its peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
The annual profits calculated before taxes increased by 40 per cent year-on-year, thus 380 million pounds, and turnover increased by 18 per cent to 1.6 billion pounds.
Pidgley said on Monday ahead of the company’s annual meeting that Berkeley’s earnings for the year correspond to the market’s current expectations.
Analysts agree that the entire year’s pre-tax profit is <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley's stock sold on the London Stock Exchange at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96.
Hacker's daughter Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards event.
The hacker who claims to hold 100-star photos of the Oscars has stolen the nukes of actress Jennifer Lawrence online.
A star of the Hunger Games confirmed that the images are genuine and condemned the hacker for "smoking violation of privacy".
Viranomas have been contacted, and anyone who publishes photos stolen from Jennifer Lawrence will be charged.
The images, originally published on the 4chan webpage, had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple’s iCloud storage system. The list of 100 other stars targeted by hacking is said to have included dozens of other female stars, including Mary, Oltoed, and Mary, Winzzae, Kardaan, Rihanna.
It is not known how much of the images are real, however, Scott Pilgrim against World star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
“To those who look at the photos of me and my husband in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you have a good mind,” Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of the series "iCarly" and "Victorious" of Nickolodeon denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called nude images are in my opinion REAL, you don't understand."
Let me put an end to this from the very beginning.
BuzzFeed announced late on Sunday that pop star Ariana Grande's representative had denied the authenticity of the star's images.
The only thing we can do is to thank Howard Jacobson for the new novel that tells us about love and the j-letter.
They slipped, it portrayed the best of what had happened, gradually ejecting each other like a box of paperboard left out of the box.
Only occasionally did she hear from the woman that she was too serious, laborious, intense, disconnected, and perhaps even a little tedious.
Then he shook his hand.
He didn't recognize the whistle.
Yeah, he was slim, like a silk.
The last victim of his peaks was a relationship in the early stages, which, however, had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have relieved his lonely boredom, and it might have brought some content to his life.
The family of Solomons had unendurable hair, and she was a delicate and beautiful woman with a cheerful heart, a northern village that was even more expensive and farther away than Port Reuben.
He had come to the south with an older travel partner, who Kevern assumed to be his aunt, and had inherited a house in a wet but paradisiacal valley, and the name of the valley was appropriately Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for years.
The tubes floated, there were spiders in all the bathrooms, the ethanes had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place their own, the garden grew rich herbs that resembled giant caliber heads.
The cottage was like a child's rain, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Literature Award in 2014.
Candidates will be announced next week
Kevern was sitting hand in hand with Ailinn on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long haul, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening distraughtly to the reception, through which the whole country heard the calming sound of the sound, the calming sounds of the sounds, the calming sounds of the sounds and the calming sounds of the sounds of the sounds.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were initially too aggressive, and they were no longer played at the reception.
They weren’t banned—nothing was actually banned—they just didn’t call anymore.
They wanted to be forgotten, just as the word itself was forgotten.
The general opinion produced what was not achieved by the laws and the statements: just as in the field of literature, people chose to read the memories of heroes, cookbooks and romances, in terms of music they favored ballads.
During the day, Kevern started to play the imaginary piano with the keys and sings Serena Ailinn’s big legs in a ruthless coma.
The family didn't understand.
"It was the famous song of the jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and at the same time raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
That's what his father always did, before the letter "j" hits his lips.
It started as a game between him and his dad when he was a kid.
His father said he played the same game with his own father.
If you let the word start with j out of your mouth, and you don't remember to put two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn’t a fun game at the time, and it wasn’t.
He knew it was expected from him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
My family had never heard of anything like that.
Jazz wasn’t actually banned, it wasn’t just called.
Improvisation is no longer in fashion.
There was room in life for only one if-word.
At the beginning of the song, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The novelty had happened the same way.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a nobility performed through music.
Although Kevern hadn't heard Sammy Davis Junior before the age of 10, jazz music had become known to him through his father's seminal CD collection.
Well, at least she didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given the age of Ailinn, it was likely that he did not remember a time when popular singers weren’t black.
There is no need for laws or coercion.
The Hearing Society meant that each part of it accepted as grateful—thankful that they had been spared by trade—the principle that each group did natural things to it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, Afro-Caribbean genitals are best suited for entertainment and sports, so they sing and run.
Originally from the mainland of India, they were like naturally gifted with electrical appliances, so their task was to ensure that every family had a working phone that was used to handle things.
Those who remained from the Polish community worked as piping workers; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When it came to its realization, when SE, who had been in the Persian Gulf and in the Middle East, and whose grandparents had not fled in fear of being accused of burning, and of being accused of being fired, and of being afraid of being fired, and of being fired, and of being fired, and of being afraid of being fired, and of being fired,
Let each act according to his gifts.
The family had only heard ballads, and it was difficult for him to understand how Kevern’s words of insult could never have been worn as music.
Through music, love was expressed.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except for the big-footed ones.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of security.
Not a single word would pass through the soundproofing of gigantic peanut leaves.
The family still didn’t understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to raise two fingers to his lips with Ailinn.
My family thought it was too late.
"It was fun for my dad," he said instead.
The man’s head was unfaithful, and his hair covered Kevern’s field of view.
Nothing to see around the world but Ailinn's huge, sturdy haircut.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you say that once," he said, but did not sound convinced.
But that doesn’t explain why you’re singing it to me.
My family seemed to be really confused.
Are my legs so big?
He looked again.
Your legs aren't really big.
Your nipple, maybe a little...
And you hate me because my nails are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for him.
"I think you're charming because of your thick nipples," he tried to fix the situation.
I've turned around in that sense.
This didn't help.
She wanted it to sound fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm with which he could control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father was meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his light eyes.
The family of Solomons reddened and rose from the terrace chair and at the same time dropped the receiver and poured the wine they had just drunk.
The wine was also made only from the ribbon, so it could not be used as the cause of the collision.
In his nervousness, he looked vibrating, like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
"And your thick head is what turns me in attraction to you," he said.
Except I don't feel like that.
Kevern was sorry for Ailinn, both for her own words of unnecessary cruelty and for the fear she saw in her eyes at the time when Ailinn decided to stand up against her.
Did Ailin think he'd hit?
He had never told Kevern about life in the strange northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it was basically the same as life here.
The same huge, ugly sea that waved against them.
The same messy men, though even more ruthless and ruthless than their smuggler and smuggler grandparents, walked from pub to pub, ready to beat every woman who dared to resist or bully them.
Thick head?
He'd still see a thick dick if he wasn't careful!
First, kissing had become the most common word describing the erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote to the meaningless love ballads pumping out of the receiver – first suck and then attack.
Kevern said it was too much, because it was already hostile in itself.
His family’s body language prompted him to leave.
He pulled himself out of the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern’s sadness surprised him.
This was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
The family followed him, just as his travel companion watched Kevern walk through the upstairs window, a man who was the cause of his heavy life.
When Adam left the garden, he thought.
He felt compassion for Kevern and the men in general, although some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
A man who had turned his back, a curly, shy, beaten man, who had lost all the will to fight—why did he feel that this vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he had ever seen one before this moment?
When the family Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event just described, the intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked at a public opinion-sized private facility in Ofnow, made a brief study of the minor and medium-sized violence, the persistence of inadequate violence, the lack of energy in the country, or the confinement of the territory.
"A lot has already been done, and much has yet to be done," he wrote, "to balance the natural aggression of the people who have fought for thousands of years and most often won, especially in the abandoned and remote corners where there is a sense of the vast masonry of the church towers.
However, some things cannot be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower the appetites it produces.
The people weep over the sentimental ballads, mourn stories of defeated oppositions and swear in the name of the good of marriage and family life, but at the same time the old-fashioned cruelty is kept in awe of both the rural communities and the evils of our working and urban cohabitation.
"You have a regrettable tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the entire report.
I would suggest you read less novels.
First Nussbaum dropped his gaze to the ground.
I have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you lesbian?
Esme continued to assert its right not to answer personal questions.
Feminists?
Again, the silence.
“I don’t ask,” said Luther Rabinowitz, “because I oppose atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
There are no preconceptions in this workplace.
We are the servants of an unpredictable society.
While a certain type of hypersensitivity is in itself completely acceptable and respectable, it can sometimes lead to distorted results, such as what you just presented to me.
You clearly have something against the church – and what you call cruelty or anger, others usually call natural energy and physical strength. . . .
Hockey, as if it had happened yesterday, if it had happened at all, destroys the fundamental vitality of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around in Rabinowitz's speech.
Behind Rabinowitz’s head, a flamingo pink LED light declared a direction that Ofnow had already distributed to the country in the last quarter of the century or longer.
Smile to your neighbors, appreciate your partners, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, and singing is better than writing, but nothing overcomes love.
"I understand very well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a silent voice when she was sure that her director had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively cured as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will notice that we are repeating the same mistakes that originally led to the SELF, WHAT YOU HAVE HAPPENED, WHEN YOU HAVE HAPPENED.
This time, however, we will not spill our hatred and distrust of others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This act meant endless patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “in describing ‘mistakes’ the actions that our grandparents may or may not have done.
You will also go too far when you say that they leaked 'their hatred and distrust in others'."
A person like you should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about 'us' or 'them'.
There was no “we” or “mute”.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are completely honest, in that chaos," Esme dared to continue, "no group of society can say that they have behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, whether it was good or bad.
That's when it was.
We don’t have to talk about it anymore – we agree.
And just as it is unnecessary to allocate allegations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are appropriate or not, and even if there is any way to do them.
But what is the past for if it is not taken as a lesson --
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said, expressing that Esmen was time to leave.
The next day, when he went to work as usual, he was hit by a pedestrian who was described by passers-by as "bad and angry".
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho army refuses attack planned; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Officials of the Lesotho Army have denied the attack they planned to overthrow the government and said they are working against police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maserus.
The head of state travelled with his family to the neighboring country of South Africa after he was told that he had received a death threat.
Army spokesman Major Ntle Ntoi denied the attack and said that the army responded to the threat, which had come from "political fanatics". Police have been said to have tried to arm fanatics.
"The Lesotho Defence Forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fans as they are ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America news agency.
According to South African government chairman Clayson Monyela, the military’s actions appeared to be a revolutionary enterprise.
"While no one has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces appear to be the hallmarks of a revolutionary enterprise on every side," he said.
According to the Lesotho military officials, the soldiers will return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital was in a peaceful atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjo Metsing leads the government while Thabane is away.
Thabane says he believes that he is the target of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
Lesotho has been experiencing tensions since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to large coalition government disagreements.
He thus denies the power of the government, even if it is said otherwise.
Tradesheet: Microsoft sets up data center for New Zealand
Microsoft has set up a large data center for New Zealand in a location that the company does not agree to specify.
In a statement to Microsoft’s media outlets, the company says it does not tell the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It’s an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars for Microsoft.
In public, the site of the center had previously been mined in Oulu or Kajana.
Microsoft is shutting down its Oulu plant, which will take about 500 people to work.
In total, Microsoft has announced its dismissal of a maximum of 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, Microsoft’s chief communications officer, told STT that the company did not comment on how much staff the new data center is employing.
The establishment of the data center for New Zealand was reported by the Handelsblatt on Monday.
Man Accused of Overtime in Traffic Valuation
A 78-year-old man is charged with driving a three-year-old girl in a traffic accident in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of driving a girl at a crossroads in Pittenween in eastern Neuk.
According to prosecutors, Stewart accidentally drove his Audi Q3 and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied allegations at the Dundee Sheriff's hearing.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take pictures or videos underwater, you have a number of different equipment options to choose from.
The cheapest option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3<0x2B> Silver Edition, both of which cost about <0x24>300.
I took these pictures at a family celebration using a number of different cameras, each costing less than <0x24>350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that are worth following.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera’s battery and other parts are waterproof.
In addition, set the camera's image settings to match the images or video to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of cameras and video cameras have a setting to optimize underwater shooting conditions.
In addition, before jumping into the water, make sure how deep your device can take.
Some cameras last only 5 feet deep, others up to 50-60 feet deep.
Check out both conventional and waterproof models in our shopping guide and digital camera reviews.
Take several pictures – many of them will fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to summarize the image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see underwater, and the sommation of the image can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
In addition, if your camera allows gripping, which means taking multiple pictures at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface of your photos in the pool, lake or sea.
This will also give your images more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the target.
This is an important tip when describing the ground, but even more importantly underwater, because the light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle, i.e. the imager must be close to the object in order for the object to fill the entire frame of the image.
China will not let Hong Kong choose its leaders – protesters swear revenge
China's parliament on Sunday ruled that Hong Kong's voters should not be allowed to elect candidates for the 2017 election despite the growing unrest requiring democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give the long-awaited protests of the Hong Kong Business District to the protests that activists began to plan and implement only hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the People’s Congress of China will practically give the Communists power to banish all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
“This was expected, but it is still outrageous,” said Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are working with autonomous government.
Deputy Secretary-General of the People’s Congress of China, Li Fei, defended China’s administration by saying it would be “too chaotic” to become a general candidate for the Hong Kong leader.
Since 1997, when the UK surrendered Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised its residents that it would be able to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders, Sunday’s decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote directly in elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the election process through a nomination committee run by Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
In the summer leading up to the decision, some of the region’s biggest and most prominent protests were held in Hong Kong over the years.
Behind the campaign for democracy was largely the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the business district if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal right to vote.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the decision was issued, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central movement gathered in front of Hong Kong’s main administration buildings.
During the protest, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement would move to a new era of non-citizenship and that they would trigger protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not reveal details apparently fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In an online press release, the organizers said the move "considered Occupy Central as the last means to be introduced only if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way."
We are very sorry to announce that today's last opportunity for dialogue has been lost and the Centre's takeover will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security operations were tightened near the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
The unrest in Hong Kong is fueled by the feeling that residents are slowly losing power in their city.
The wave of imports from the continent has caused competition for products and services.
In addition, there is fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are disappearing under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its expressions threaten Hong Kong’s lifestyle – the business world.
“The protest they’re talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it takes,” says Regina Ip, a lawmaker who has long criticized the move.
We do not want to be concerned that Hong Kong is slipping away from our retreat.
Such an attitude would be bad for investing.
The Chinese state media has also presented stories that say Hong Kong’s democratic activists are the handshakes of the revolutionary Western powers.”
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights, attended by 780,000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
In July, tens of thousands of protesters took part in one of the region’s largest pro-democracy demonstrations.
U.S. Prom History Attacks UK Universities: Private Budgets for New Students
We respond enthusiastically to the demand by establishing Britain’s first luxury travel form for today’s students.
In addition to the private aircraft, the company also offers other vehicles, such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most memorable arrival to the university.
According to Stewart, the service also has a security aspect.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise squeeze their assets across the country in cars loaded along the edges.
When this is combined with many VIP features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer today’s students as easy and high-quality transportation to the university as possible.
According to the representative of the company, reservations have not yet come, because the service has just been established, but added that "students will start making orders in the coming weeks".
The company believes that the service is in demand, although most students pay <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 in academic year fees.
Today’s students are very different from 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of their expectations and aspirations. Now more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Students' Association criticizes a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice president of the organization’s higher education division, “this service plan seems to be very far from the lives of the majority of students.”
Many will begin their studies this month on the shocking level of cost of living, as the available financial support in the form of loans and grants have remained after the magnificent increase in basic costs. Only then can you start to think about where to find thousands of help to get used.

In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wished to restore the old labour rules, which had recently been amended.

Basketball: Fan Encouragement Almost Too Much: Sasu Salin was on the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was today the embodiment of Finland’s victory.
He was able to forget the scam of his USA match and browsed Ukraine’s second half with his bloody solutions.
But Salin passed everything of honor to the Sufis and did it in the style of:
But I wanted to go there at the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
In my eyes, I could see nothing.
That melted and the white sea was almost too much for me.
The effects of the copy included nine surfaces at a fast pace, ball wreaths, discs, and stamping wherever it took place.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into a flow mode that it all worked out.
They come from something, someday, to a very insanely important place, Sasu whispered.
That's my role.
Do all of that.
It was great to see that others were caught up in the story.
It caught up with the whole gang.
Salin is the team’s pilgrim and lifeguard, so it’s no wonder that his example brought the whole team to flight, which was too big and hard-working for the Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after a 32-year break: The previous one was remembered for a rough referee game
Heikki Montonen was the head coach of Finland at the 1982 Argentine World Cup.
It has been 32 years since the last time the Finnish men's volleyball team played in the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and current player agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as they did yesterday: it was a fierce match against France at the start.
"In the final balls of this match, the referee's game was awful," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled on the rear line.
All of a sudden the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then the shit got more confused,” Parkkali said.
Finland played head coach Heikki Montosen and finally placed 17th.
Finland is once again among the world championships, with the Polish World Cup accelerating on Saturday.
Many things have changed sharply in international football over the course of 32 years.
The strength values of the players are roughly the same class as before, but the quality and skill are now more.
The average length of the players has also increased.
The game is faster,” Parkkali thought.
But what about Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded, and the load can be shared.
I’m looking forward to Finland coming from the start.
“It can be tough,” Kosonen said.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in an attack in a winning match against Tunisia.
The current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup tournament.
Hopefully we’ll take the 17th place now.
"South Korea and Tunisia should go nuts," Parkkali said.
The Kingdom of Kosonen was the second coach of the team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkö have won the match against Tunisia.
Sauna and evening charter at the Buenos Aires Maritime Church were part of the country team's program in the 1982 World Cup tournament.
Kari Kalin (ok.) stretches with his teammates.

Finnish tourists rescue Cita dog from mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all praise"
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and her dogs were in trouble on Thursday in the mountains, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
On the weekend, Mikkelsen searched for “international heroes” on Facebook to thank his supporters once again.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that a Cita dog who was with him on Thursday in the mountains hurt his pocket.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in the steep terrain.
I tried to bring it down myself, but I didn't succeed, so I had to let it be.
I tried many times to attract and pull it a little further, but its legs didn’t just stand, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, no help came from the police, the nearby hotel, or the passers-by.
In the dark of the night, the situation began to appear threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Tampere Antti Soini and her father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway at Galdh<0xC3><0xB8>piggen and headed to their camp when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help her with the dog, Antti Soini tells Itta-Sanom in his message.
Soon a German man came to the scene with a slippery slope.
Patia Citale received the same pairs that the injured dog was attached to.
A German man came to us for a moment after we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog in his arms for a moment down the track, Soini says.
In other words: Sophie
The dog was brought down with a walker.
According to Soni, the performance was not physically heavy, but the loading on the difficult terrain was slow.
About an hour and a half later, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen was still looking for “international heroes” on Facebook to thank them once again.
The phone calls were answered on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unsuccessful.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen is happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
I would like to find these people because I feel like I haven’t thanked them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and honor, I am eternally grateful to them.
On Monday night, the Sonites were already on their way home.
They had received happy news from Mikkelsen: - I hear you're already better!

The beautiful and bold series Beautiful and bold will return to the box today after the summer break.
The name of the opening season raises questions.
The most popular soap series of all time in Finland Beautiful and bold come back from the summer season.
The name of the season is intriguingly "Oral Happiness with Eric".
The evening program description describes the following section:

Eric is loyal to his necklace style.
For the color of the lunch jersey, he has chosen a white, lilying.
Ridge offers Kate support in dealing with the traumas caused by Brooke and Bill.

Genetic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed.
A British woman has been afraid of death for years due to a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers believed most of her youth that she had only a few years to live because she had been diagnosed with another disease.
Actually, she suffers from Charcot-Marie-Producer’s disease (CMT), which means a set of hereditary diseases that damage the outer nerves of the brain and spinal cord.
According to the Charity CMT UK charity, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because they are so little known.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT disease, which causes symptoms in motor motors, such as muscle weakness, difficulty walking, and toes cramping.
The disease can also cause insomnia or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms will worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he was suffering from Friedreich’s Ataxia (FA), which has a really poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would fall into a wheelchair before he was 18 and die before he reached the age of 30.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two says, “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as everyone else.
I fell down every day and it took me longer than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he was undergoing several aile belt surgery to straighten his legs, and when he left the doctor’s room, he quickly looked at his research papers saying he was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I came home, I checked the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” she says.
When I found out from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would fall into a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I turned 25, and in the meantime I would slowly lose all my ability to operate.
I went through this myself and designed my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he stated that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he thought and asked his doctor about it.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "Girl, I don't think you have this disease, otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you've suffered from something much less dangerous.
According to some gene tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
“When I was explained what CMT was, I thought it was delaying me,” he says.
Charity CMT UK organizes a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
One Hundred Migrants Found in a Carbon Carriage in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal immigrants on a train carrying coal, the interior ministry said on Monday.
The passengers were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The transferees were found late on Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They didn’t know where they were, where they came from and where they were going,” interior ministry spokesman Ivo Koteski said.
According to the police, the migrants had paid around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3,000 each to reach Greece, and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800-900 to reach Serbia.
Illegal immigrants travel a lot through Macedonia with a few million inhabitants on their way to Western Europe.
Already three million people have fled the bloody Syrian civil war.
The Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai Support Scottish Independence

Most sales grew in retail stores and large supermarkets.
Over the course of the beginning of the year, i.e. in January, the turnover of commodity houses and hypermarkets decreased by more than 2%.
On the other hand, sales of everyday goods have increased by almost 1%.
Joan Rivers family 'best wish'

Areva-Siemens: Three-layer reactor to be completed in mid-2016
Areva has delivered an updated schedule of Olkiluoto 3 to the Industrial Force TVO.
According to Areva, the recent delays in the project were largely due to the request for approval of the automation systems of the reactor.
The project is already years late.
In May, TVO did not give any estimates of the completion time of the triple reactor.
Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of beach towel to Bottax - valued at around 60000 euros
The municipal government of Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of beach land to Valtteri Bottax from Villähet on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi.
The municipality showed fairness to the athlete and was unanimous in its decision.
There were no noises at the meeting when the tone was decided, says Mayor Pauli Syrakki.
The bottax gift shop has farm buildings - a total of seven pieces.
The municipality will dismantle them this year with the exception of one.
Bottas has promised to build a free-time apartment for the farm within two years.
We are convinced that he has enjoyed his birthplace and wants to be here in the future as well.
Valtteri has attended sub-grades every year to tell about his sporting career and life.
And hopefully it will continue, says the mayor.
The mayor estimates the value of the beach land for 40000-60000 euros.
The beach is low and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for many years.
With varying success over the decades, Nastola has held successful athletes in the municipality with the help of non-talents.
World champion of winter emission Aki Parviainen and world champion of aerobics Tuuli Matinsalo received homeless people from the municipality and built their own homes.
However, they did not stay in Nastola but sold their property and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalon came to Nastola in the aftermath of the work and then changed the life situation after changing elsewhere.
Bottas is a native nastola and his situation is different, Syyrakki's thumb and believes Bottas is in his permanent home.
Insanity laundered attacker Hernandez with record sum
Uruguayan national team Abel Hernandez's record-breaking acquisition of Hull.
Hernandez exchanges for Hulli Italian ship from Palermo for <0xC2><0xA3>9.5 million, or about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12 million.
The agreement is three-year.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and rose to Italy’s main series.
In the Uruguay national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 matches.
In the final of last summer's World Cup, Hernández came to the field in two matches.
“Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time,” said Steve Bruce, head coach of Hull.
On Monday, Hull said he had also acquired Senegalese national team captain Mohamed Diamen West Ham.
Russia's space experiment failed - geeks sent to sex trips died
The five small geckos sent to Russia to expand into space have died, the Russian Federation's space agency Roscosmos said in a statement.
The Geeks travelled on the Foton-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to Earth on Monday morning in Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of geckos in an unweighted state.
The experiment was conducted by one male jerk and four females.
Although the experiment sounds different, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness, for example, on the development of gecko eggs.
The effects on geckos can be used to try to predict what effects weight loss would have on a person if it stayed in the same state for longer periods, New Statesman noted in July.
According to Roscosmok, the time and cause of death of the geeks is being investigated.
According to the Interfax news agency, passengers who were baptized as "sex couples" were frozen.
It is also surprising that the fertilizers who travelled on the same Foton-M4 survived the journey with no difficulty, and also received post-growth.
France detains terrorist suspect at Nice airport
France detained a man suspected of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of serving as a recruiter for a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities reported this on Sunday.
Authorities found the man after he had attracted money from a 16-year-old girl to leave for Syria.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the border of Syria.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother living in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
The authorities contacted the father of the girl, who was completely unaware of her daughter’s intentions and told the authorities that the family is not related in Turkey.
According to the authorities, the man is from Chechnya, but he currently lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had already monitored the man’s actions.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that the young people who are attracted to the Iraqi or Syrian wars pose a security risk to France as well.
Authorities estimate that some 800 French nationals or books in France have travelled to, returned from, or are currently planning to leave during the last conflict in Syria.
Koponene: We have good chances of winning
The hopes of the basketball team for a second place are in play as Finland face Ukraine today in their second match of the World Cup.
If the opening loss for the United States was expected, Ukraine will once again be one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe we have a good chance of winning, Petteri Koponen predicted.
On Saturday, Ukraine beat the Dominican Republic 72-62 in their first game.
The team is trained by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, who is in charge of which Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is game manager Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is the 100-metre world champion in three years.
Jeter scored 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
"The Pooh Jeter is a fast fighter, but we've been played against them before and we need to get our normal defense in order," Koponen said.
Hanno Mötölä promised that Finland would play better than yesterday's loss to the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee you will see a normal wolf in the field, Mötölä said.
Hollywood stars’ alleged nuts spread online – part confirmed to be authentic
On the Internet, there are a number of nude images that are alleged to represent well-known public figures.
Actress Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a "snake campaign".
The entertainment website TMZ has released an angry comment by Lawrence’s representatives that seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant breach of privacy.
Viranomas have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) Jennifer Lawrence's stolen pictures will be put on trial, the representatives threaten.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images that are circulating about her are genuine.
She had taken these pictures with her husband years ago.
When I know those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what awful pain was seen for this.
I feel sympathy for all those who have been victims of hacking, he writes according to the site.
Actress Victoria Justice says the images on her behalf are fake.
Real or fake nude photos are also moving, at least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka painter criticized his own: "They don't work enough to get out of here"
Soccer club FC Honka is currently in the last place of the Veikkausliga.
The comments of goalkeeper Walter Viitala on Sunday after the VPS match well describe the current situation of the track.
I haven't had a paint coach in four months.
But everything needs to be adjusted," said Viitala after a 1-2 loss.
Honka made a lot of mistakes in the first half of the match.
The goalkeeper Viitala was not bad at playing defense.
The traffic of the players in Hong Kong has been bustling this summer, and for this reason the defenders in front of the Viitala have also changed to a strict pace.
With the player roulette, many young players have also gained opportunities that they may not even deserve.
"Some people don't work enough to get out of here at some point," he said without appointing any individual player.
Hong Kong's chief coach Shefki Kuqi was somewhat in agreement with Viitala.
"After the game, I told certain players that if you come to workouts and games to have fun and you think you're a squad player and you don't have to work, you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, then it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that players cannot expect immediate success when the players are constantly changing.
There have not been two consecutive sessions in this period.
Particularly in defense, the crowd has changed.
That’s the biggest reason we’re here,” Kuqi said.
After a VPS loss, Honka is in the series, with TPS in second place.
There are still seven rounds left in the draw league, so the left have time to avoid falling to the 1st.
I've never floated a team, and I'm not going to float now.
We’re not really going to drop out of this series,” Viitala threatened.
Lars von Trier to make a TV series after a decade of breaks
Filmmaker Lars von Trier plans to return to the television series.
The Danish director is preparing a TV series called The House That Jack Built.
The series was told by Louise Vesth, who worked as a film producer in Trier on Monday at the Venice Film Festival.

"Stop your breathing," Aalb<0xC3><0xA6>k Jensen said in the press release.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been renowned for his high-profile media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac in recent years.
He directed the Kingdom Series for television in the 1990s.

Britt Isabelle Roberts screamed so loudly when cold water was poured on her that she damaged the bone of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman has been taken to the treatment of her Ice Bucket challenge when she performs so strong that her skull went to her place.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so loudly when cold water was poured on her that she damaged the structure of her face.
“The water was so cold that I was just screaming, but when I was screaming, I felt like my leg was starting to stiffen,” he told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts before the accident.
I tried to close my mouth, but I couldn't, my leg was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and my sister noticed the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to cheer for the first aid.
The 20-year-old Briton, who participated in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday, was taken to a hospital where the bone was put back in place.
The video has become an Internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Viewing angle of the wolf’s wing (also): How can the increase in the number of fans explain?
Today was a great day.
This is what basketball player Sakari Pehkone said in 1995, when Finland had played in the European Championship final against France in the Athens Marouss.
No exaggeration.
I remember the game when I was there.
This was also the case with some 100 Finns who shouted 20,000 spectators, otherwise empty-handed.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the Finnish-Ukrainian World Cup?
In Bilbao there are a hundred Finnish fans’ troops eighty times.
The 1995 European Championships were a season for Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the end of the tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian championship at the Helsinki Sports Hall.
That victory opened the doors to Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Mötölä.
Coach Henrik Dettmann raised Möttöl to the final tournament team.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now it can be said that Dettmann was far from wise, even though not everything went according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team plunged deep.
In total, more than 100 Finns were present at the Athens competitions.
Among them were journalists, relatives of the players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
Bilbao also has journalists, relatives and coaches, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
No one can say the exact number of Finnish artists.
Estimates ranged from 7,500 to 10,000.
Whatever the number in the meantime, it's a completely incomprehensible number.
Here's an explanation for sports psychologists.
In the global economy, companies are crossing borders.
There is still an opportunity in sport to see how we are doing internationally.
With the increase in mobility, we can visit to see how our daughter and son are succeeding in the world,” says Hannu Itkonen, professor of gymnastics.
Surely, both in Spain and at the World Cup in Poland, there are Finns looking for experience.
A common experience.
But it doesn't explain everything.
In sports, too, there must be attraction.
Itkonen promotes sport into popular culture.
It’s a lower threshold to go to sports venues than to Berlin to watch art.
Without success, the masses will not be able to move.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time, head coach Detmann challenged the basketball league and also the players to throw themselves into the top sport professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the field team activity was raised to the foot.
The balloon crew did the same move a little earlier.
Now they both enjoy the fruit of the work.
As Itkonen says, both species have succeeded in producing their top sport, where the Holy Trinity works: sports media sponsors.
The audience will also be interested.
And the media has taught what such carnival support is, Itkonen recalls.
Will the balloon species be able to transfer this massive interest to home series as well?
On average, basketball and volleyball are played for hundreds or a little over a thousand spectators.
I cry to consider the question a good one, and not necessarily give an answer that would promise very good species.
The other school believes the interest is shifting.
The second is the one who doesn’t want a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready to experience the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, the series of their home countries are not dually interested.
It's a challenge for people in the middle of the night.
Bottex canyon - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake beach
Nastola is rewarded by formula driver Valtteri Bottax on the beach tint.
The municipal government unanimously approved the 1.4-hectare land donation at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, there will be a free-time apartment.
The success of Bottasa has been monitored in Nastola since the Karting era.
He is seen as an ambassador to market Lahta, the town of Lahta and Nastola.
It is located in Koiskala, on the shores of Lake Kärkjärve.
It has become the property of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate trade.
There are seven decommissioned buildings in the area, from which the municipality will be decommissioned at the cost of six by the end of this year.
Bottas reached his fourth prize this year in the Belgian Formula One competition.
He is fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a Nastorian native and lived in Dell<0xC3><0xA6>tet from his childhood.
He lives in England now, but he visits Nasloon every time he is free of formulas.
Bottas has visited high schools and youth camps.
Design smart clothes are coming - but hardly for the poor
It will present and test them at the U.S. Open in New York.
Ralph Lauren’s smart-sleeve testers are field players, but amateur Marcus Giron, one of the top college players, likes it.
He said the shirt will help him monitor his own development and regulate his recovery.
The nail-shirt is woven with silver sensors, from which the information is transmitted to the hood in the shirt and from there to the smartphone or tablet computer.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
Dispose of the moccala as a central unit before throwing the shirt into the washing machine.
The fashion house did not tell you exactly when to start selling the shirt, nor did it even suggest its price, Tech Times reported.
Raph Lauren is not the only smartwear company.
The Californian Athos has brought on the sale of smart shirts and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
Clothes cost <0x24>100 per piece and they require an inch-sized central unit to cost <0x24>200.
Red Orbit has also written about technology.
A smart way to save on textbooks
The cost of university books in America is more than <0x24>1,000 per student, so soon to start his second year, Matt Schroeder invented a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system where students in later year courses lend their books for a nominal fee instead of selling the books on the same path forward.
“My mathematics book would normally have cost <0x24>180; I paid <0x24>10 for its use for the entire semester, and I had a sandbox,” says 19-year-old Schroeder, a student at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says his last semester books would normally cost <0x24>430.
Instead, he spent <0x24>120 on them.
According to the University’s board of directors, an average student spends more than <0x24>1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online stores and creative approaches like Schroeder’s idea.
An increasing number of students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay for it significantly less than students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, which holds more than 250 campus bookshops, the rent of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the sector reveal that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores last spring were rent books, says Trevor Meyer, president of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
E-shops
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained by a third of the price it would cost at the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostet’s “Calculus” book is worth almost <0x24>290, but Chegg.com’s online bookstore costs <0x24>239.99.
Purchase as used
Used books are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by the notes of others and the outdated appearance.
For example, the "Calculus" book is used from the Chegg.com online store for <0x24>93.49.
Matt Casaday, a 25-year-old student at Brigham Young University, says he bought Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business from Amazon.com for just <0x24>0.42.
The new book would have cost <0x24>48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of the Amherst's College Without Walls School at the University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new edition are not relevant to teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found at a fraction of the price, which should cost the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Leasing
It is worth considering hiring ideas if you take good care of them, remember to return them, and do not need them when you complete the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% on the price of a new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book for the entire semester costs about <0x24>20.
Check out the rules of the leasing company, such as notes, use of the highlight pen and the use of the following payments.
The tenant, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the delay fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Getting e-books instead of regular papers can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are rented, whereby they are paid for the right to access the e-book to its holder, for example to Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc. bookstores.
The Chegg store will receive the "Calculus" e-book for six months for about <0x24>61.
According to Bracey, many literature students save the most because many classics can now be downloaded for free, while science and engineering books can be very expensive.
It is worth comparing the different vendors, whichever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who starts soon in Pepperdine’s law school, recommends using the ISBN number to determine the price, as it can help ensure that he is looking for the right book.
Before you order online, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned this through his leg.
The delivery of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he finally had to get the book at a full price from the university bookstore.

Almost twice the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
This year, there have been almost twice as many deaths in the fires as last year.
According to the media surveillance of the Finnish Rescue Agency (Spek), 55 people have been killed in 49 different fires so far.
At the same time last year, there were 31 deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, were men.
Over the age of 65, there were 11.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the worst case was in 2009, when 64 people were killed in the fires by the end of August.
The majority of deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 firefights in apartment buildings, 21 in private houses and seven in rows and other farmhouses.
Spec reminds me of repeating the fire safety of the home.
At least all home fire alarms should be ensured, according to Spek.
In addition, it should be checked by everyone that the initial detergents are easy to use.
All home premises must also have an unobstructed exit route.
Children should also be told what electrical appliances they can use when alone at home.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport to march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at the Cardiff City Hall for the so-called response summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke to the protesters who had arrived on the spot even from Belgium.
Youth Rescued in Flight from Australian Blue Mountains
ALL teenage hikers were taken to the Blue Mountains, located in New South Wales, Australia, after a night of detention.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man left for a walk after noon on Sunday at Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
They were worried about young people who hadn’t returned home, and called the police at eight o’clock.
A search batch of local police and helpers was sent to search for young people, and the twin was found around 23:00 near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and hit her head.
The police spent the night with the couple, and they were taken to safety on Monday morning.
The refugees were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from Luhansk airport.
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian military, soldiers were given a retreat order.
According to Ukraine, the paratroopers have joined forces with Russian tanks on the ground.
According to an army spokesman, the counterparty's shot was so precise that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
In the last 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.
Ukraine's patrol ship, which received an artificial ion in the south-eastern Ukrainian Sea, sank in the morning, the border guard said.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border breakdown was unsure of where the ship was shot.
Separatists told us yesterday about the start of their shooting on social media.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that Ukrainian troops should immediately resign to positions from which they could not shoot civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, the talks in Minsk today between Russia, Ukraine and Ethiopie should lead to an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Lavrov also reminded that Russia will respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
Rising rains caused flooding in Malmö and Copenhagen
Streets flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen on Sunday as heavy rains hit southern Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters cut off several roads, confused traffic and buried cars alone.
Authorities estimate Sunday that it may take a long time to mitigate the flood, although the rains were predicted to stop by Monday.
The Swedish authorities were surprised by heavy rains, and no warning of rains was given in advance.
The meteorologist Ari Mustala of the Finnish Meteorological Institute of Meteorology estimates that the area was very local.
The rainy area looks narrow and permanent in its place.
No wonder it has been hard to predict.
French Socialists Should “Be Quiet and Help France,” Francois Hollande’s Chief Supporter Says
Valls called on the deeply divided left to "show their feelings" for a socialist president in difficulty, whose new government was not endorsed by the French majority.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our task is to stay with him," Valls said and deserved applause.
The Prime Minister called for the government to leave the 35-hour week of work, despite the new economic minister Emmanuel Macron's proposal earlier this week, to discuss the proposal that the rule should be suspended.
On Saturday, Hollande called on the Socialists to cooperate with the government.
Justice Minister Christiane Taubira, however, sparked a controversy over the meeting of Socialist representatives who expressed disagreement and criticized the Socialist Party for allowing France to "abstain from hope for the future".
The leader of the far-right Nationalist Party, Marine Le Pen, mocked the socialists’ ongoing bias and said he did not believe the new government would last a few months longer.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but so did Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the former did not last even a summer.
“And the new government will not last until autumn or winter,” Le Pen told reporters.
He repeated his party's proposal to dismantle the parliament and was confident of his party's election victory in the early elections, and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing loss in the March municipal elections and the far-right held a swing in the May EU elections.
According to a poll published in Sunday’s Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party may split into several groups that compete with each other before the end of the Dutch season in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political researcher at the University of California, warned that the French would soon lose patience unless the new socialist government managed to improve the economy and record high unemployment.
“There is little chance of success, but the public must quickly notice that the change is happening,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Pokka cheated on Finnish players Kirsi Alm-Siiran, Nina Rahkolan and meteorologist Pekka Pouda cheated heavily on the recorded part of the program.
The Morning Finland program published on its Facebook page last Thursday a funny video of the recordings made on Thursday.
In the video, the runners Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and the meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record Huomenta from the next day’s advertising buffalo, but the recording does not go into the pipe.
Alm-Siira confuses his words when he tries to pronounce the word budgetary, and his confusion also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their pussy one after the other.
And these heroes should be allowed to draw live broadcasts even tomorrow, says the Finnish Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been liked and shared more than 10,000 times on Facebook.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked in the photo office of the magazine, was ranked third in the series of portraits in 1972.
This is the picture of Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
The Socialist International Meeting was held at the Fredrikinkadu Building Masters House in Helsinki in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting and security measures were enormous.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven lifeguards joined.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had plenty of five minutes to film.
I took this picture in four to five meters.
The light and the background were there.
I immediately realized that this time I was successful.
From the appearance of Meeri, we can see that the leaders of the Middle East have had a hard time in the past.
Then, in the competition, you were able to capture photos of famous people or events.
It is great that today you can also succeed with other images, as long as there is an idea and a visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is the fall of Lasse Virén at the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Argument: Aarnio survey has already paid more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 million
Investigating the legality of the operation of the Helsinki police drug unit has already cost more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 million and required 30-50 years of work.
This is how Jyri Rajamäki assessed his IT thesis at the University of Jyväskylä.
He argues that the monitoring of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining the IT systems for investigation and judicial processing.
According to Rajamä, current technology allows for the multi-use of criminal material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system whereby the information to be collected for the identification of the crime must automatically be electronic evidence that fills the chain of evidence while at the same time enabling comprehensive legality control.
The claim will be checked on Saturday.
Top: The 1999 concept of vegetable food was forgotten on the wall of the school: "Fish and canoe foods included in the vegetable diet"
A photo of a special press release on the wall of the Pirkkala Women's Travel School caused food on social media, says Yle on its website.
Vegetarians!
Vegetable meals included in the school lunch are served.
Only when there is meat on the list, we make a vegetable option!
This is said in a 15-year-old, forgotten school wall announcement.
You can see the picture here.
The image circulated on social media has led people to send an outrageous feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, head of food and cleaning services, tells Yle that the forgotten note on the wall is not correct and should have been removed some time ago.
Apparently, before my arrival, there has ever been such an idea, which has been discussed at the time with healthcare.
Every student is given a meal according to his wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are offered a vegetarian diet option only with the permission of their parents and a certificate of vegetarian diet by a doctor or health care provider.
The danger is based on the solution for Yle, because young vegetarian food experiments may leave nutrition depleted and the lack of meat or chicken may be a wonder from the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise closes <0x24>3 billion in Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NKHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise company, is negotiating to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for <0x24>3 billion.
With the deal, Norwegian Cruises, which has a market value of <0x24>6.8 billion, will be able to access Prestige Cruises luxury cruisers and wealthy customers in its ongoing competition with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp.
According to sources, information on a possible agreement can be published already this week, but it is also possible that negotiations will not produce results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private equity investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruises.
The sources did not want their names to be made public because the negotiations were not held in public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the requests for comment and the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruises covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, with a turnover of <0x24>2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which operates in Miami, sails under the Oceania and Regent brands, comprising a total of eight cruises, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was <0x24>1.2 billion, 6% more than in the previous year.
The <0x24>29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the growth of emerging economies, such as China and India’s middle classes.
Companies are competing to become the first option for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first equity trading account on the U.S. stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since trading in 2007, valued at <0x24>850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 by its current assembly with its merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) -risteily company, which is the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thai.
Apollo invested <0x24>1 billion in Norwegian Cruises in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the information released, Genting accounted for 28% of the company, Apollo for 20% and TPG Capital LP for 8% from the end of June.
The combined shares of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises account for 82 percent of North America’s cruise capacity, according to a registration document published in the context of the business invoice of Prestige Cruise’s shares.
The Tampere City Council is discussing this today.
Animalia hopes that the City Council will support the initiative.
According to the Director of Animalia, Salla Tuomivaara, who is preparing a thesis at the University of Tampere, during the dolphinariums in Finland and around the world, it is worth ending quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years, there has been a growing view around the world that the attitude of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphins is neither animal-protective nor ethically sustainable.
I would also like this view to be applied to Tampere.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only a question of animal rights, but also the question of Tampere’s image as a tourist destination, Tuomaiara notes.
The death of the Näsi dolphin confirms the demands of the dolphinarium.
This is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Sarkännieme dolphinarium.
It’s time to set a dead spot, close the dolphin prison, and start exploring how the Tampere dolphins could be transferred to a confined marine area, some sort of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara demands.
This has not been able to experience a return to the original habitat of the dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Sarkennei have been able to experience even more life than their inexhaustible concrete, Tuomivaara hopes.
Animalia aims to prohibit the use of all species of wild animals in circus in the complete amendment of the Animal Protection Act in preparations.
This includes dolphinariums as well.
In support of the claim, the CEO of Animalia, Tuomivaara, will participate in a demonstration on behalf of the dolphins held today on 1.9.
The Embassy of Japan in Helsinki will take a stand against the dolphin hunting season that begins in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2,300 dolphins are captured or brutally killed each year, either for use as dolphins or for food.
Putin Calls on Kiev to Open Negotiations for New State with Eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statefulness" of the region that departs, Russian news sources said.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine should become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the population of the Russian-speaking region the power to defend their own forces.
Putin's demand for negotiations with the Russian-speaking rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his obvious strategy, which he has followed since the violence began five years ago, from the beginning of the violence to the power of the Soviet Union: he seeks to help the separatists and the Ukrainians.
In an interview with State Channel 1, Putin condemned the attempts of the Ukrainian army to regain the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Donetsk and Luhansk, which the separatists conquered in March and April when Moscow joined the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently christened the area as "Novorossia", "New Russia" – this term reminiscent of the days before the revolutions of the Russian Grand Power.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said the planned peace talks were an "illusion" as long as Ukrainian politicians are campaigning for the October 26 parliamentary elections and government forces attacking civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We must immediately begin extensive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organization of society and the status of the state in South-South Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he said.
According to Peskov, Putin’s reference to “state ownership” relates to broader independence, which has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership in an attempt to evade the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
It is not possible to hold talks on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because it is not the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but the internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin's mid-term remark, intended to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's comments, stressed that the Russian government is treating the rebel separatists in eastern regions differently than in Crimea, where it has practically ruled an area of 2 million people who are not Russians.
Moscow would be considerably more difficult to connect even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are ethnically non-Russian, and according to pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
Independence, which Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums, would give the local authorities of Ukraine the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin practically the power in the region that connects Russia.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to the Russian main fleet, as well as commercial shipping ports and historic coastal destinations.
In the area between Russia’s Rostov and Crimea there are also mines, factories and metal castings, which produce vital products for the Russian army.
Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his inaugural speech on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislators – after the new elections – consider amendments to the constitution to increase the decision-making power of Ukraine’s nuclear-weapon regions on their own economy and language status.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from the view of the Kremlin and Moscow, perhaps armed and lenient separatists.
Putin presented his latest demand to the Kiev government for negotiations with Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels advanced further last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine in the former Pacific Ocean region of Azov.
The security authorities of Ukraine fear that the takeover of the Russian-backed separatist city of Novoazovsky will be the start of a larger effort to dominate the entire strategically important coastal region to Crimea.
It has led to the massive reinforcement of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel. Mariupol is known as a steel-producing port city, located between the narrow land area leading to the Crimean Peninsula and Novoazovsk.
Poroshenko spoke in Brussels on Saturday calling on EU leaders to take further action to prevent Russia’s future violations in Ukraine, the former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders proposed the preparation of additional sanctions so that they could be put in place if the crisis in Ukraine resurfaces under unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to resign their positions in the territory of Ilovakia after two Russian Panzer Divisions and 1,000 troops moved last week to the Donetsk region to strengthen the in difficulty separatists, General Andriy Lysenko, in the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers from the Russian island of Ilovaisk were replaced by 10 Russian paratroopers who were arrested in the territory of Ukraine a week ago.
Milan's opening country was made by Japanese driver Keisuke Honda for the seventh time.
In the second half, Sulley hit Muntari first and Jeremy Menez a little later on the penalty spot.
Lazio also scored a goal at the end of the game, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez refused the shot of Antonio Candreva.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
The San Siro Stadium was only halfway through Milan's former attacking team Inzaghi's training debut.
39,000 spectators were announced for the match.
Australian publics and Gabi Grecko in the turn of the nude filming scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he has been stunned by hackers who may have stolen the nude pictures of his fiancé and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
The entertainment world has been hotter since a group of nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were published on the internet as a result of a wide-ranging celebrity-storing scandal.
The hackers are said to have a total of 60 nude images of the Star Wars star Lawrence and other superstars, including top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Images of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Greg in Melbourne have also been apparently stolen during the iCloud flight.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Last month, Edelsten told Confidential magazine, “This is impressive.”
All personal contacts and photos should be kept private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and distributed.
In New York, Gregko was reported commenting on the case in the online magazine as "horrible" and saying that the victims "feel embarrassed".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two of Palmer's samples on the upper side of the pool.
Palmer's films include the film "Love and Honor" with counter actor Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck Star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked images yesterday.
