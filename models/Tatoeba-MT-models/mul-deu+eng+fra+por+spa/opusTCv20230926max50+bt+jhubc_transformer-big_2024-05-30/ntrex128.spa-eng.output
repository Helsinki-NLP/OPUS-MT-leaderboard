Members of the Assembly (AM) of Wales are concerned about "seeming muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are upset by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament of Wales (MWP).
This uncertainty arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from all political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly stated that his group was concerned “that he would remain with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means caca.
A Wales Party Assembly Member commented that his entire group was "dissatisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the pronunciation jump from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter or in English of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, declares: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Members of the Assembly will be the matter of the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 granted the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals that revealed broad support for calling the Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the MWP option obtained most of the support in a public consultation.
Apparently, Assembly members are suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could lead to Assembly President Elin Jones, who should submit the bill on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word on the question of how they should be called when deciding on legislation.
Macedonians go to polls to vote on country name change referendum
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was summoned in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the neighboring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its nomination to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells remain silent because of the difficulties of the Harlem churches
“Historically, the older people I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
“Today, there is neither one thing nor the other.”
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize in a different way,” he says.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that the neighbors go to regularly.”
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as leaders expect and that “sooner or later, they will return to the starting point.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who will not help the shrines that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and, therefore, will accelerate the closure of these churches, as most people who move to these apartments are unlikely to end up being members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation worshiping nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took the reins of St. Martin, under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street merchants, a major Harlem shopping street, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and while Father Johnson's pilgrims were making plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the railing.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called him "the campaigns of the poor".
In July, the expert playing the ladder called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan noted that it was the world’s first railing used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to play the largest Riverside Church railing 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "tryed to pass the costs" to the council, although it had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some pilgrims complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark kills 13-year-old boy scuba diving in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while scuba diving in California on the day the scuba diving season opens, according to authorities.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited to have caught a lobster, but then realized that "he was screaming that he had been bitten.
,
I had my clavicle broken,” Hammel observed as he approached the child.
“I yelled everyone out of the water because there was a shark,” Hammel added.
The child was transported by helicopter to the Radi Children Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
Authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami Beach, in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans drive the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specializing in the hallways of their style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2800 trillion and with growth that is increasing compared to the decline in fashion and household sales, the largest beauty halls will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if the year is over, they will be the most successful.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this supermarket chain is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that used to be intended for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty offering with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-respectful products, something increasingly demanding by younger customers.
The fragrance shop will also test its concessions at two Sainsbury's establishments, the first just opened in Croydon, South London, last week. The second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the shift to daily purchase of small amounts of food in local stores force supermarkets to work hard to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said stores will increasingly resemble shopping malls as the supermarket chain tries to fight down Aldi and Lidl discount establishments by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount points in hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is considered to have boosted sales of edible and profitable further these acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to split the revenues of pharmaceutical outlets into their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s 281 pharmaceutical establishments were sold to Celesio, a company owned by the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s said: “We have transformed the look and environment of our beauty corridors in a way that enhances the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specialized staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit every need. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a convenient location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying."
Peter Jones Is “Angry” After Holly Willoughby Breaks <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones became “furious” after television presenter Holly Willoughby broke an 11-million-pound deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to dedicate to the brand of fashion and accessories Truly.
This business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den, by abandoning her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources consulted, Jones was “fury” when the television’s gold girl admitted that her new deals, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not leave time to dedicate to True, her fashion brand and accessories, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marham, Bulow.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was profiled as a favorite to double Willoughby's fortune of about <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: "Truly was, with a difference, Holly's top priority.
It was going to be its long-term future, which would keep it in the next two decades.
His decision to quit left all involved totally stranded.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow’s headquarters, products ready for sale.”
Experts believe the launch of This Morning, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to significant investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing, and possibly further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and ten years ago they have a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin television producer.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV channel.
A source close to Jones said that last night "there was no talk about business issues".
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider “poor presidential” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump renounced so many things?
Trump commented with his ridiculous voice as a “news presenter.”
"I haven't given up on anything."
He said Kim was interested in meeting with him again after Trump commended the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an “adequate response” from the U.S. to the first steps for North Korea’s disarmament.
On the contrary, he noted, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s outlook was much more optimistic in his speech during his mitin.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have generated positive results: the end of missile tests helps to release hostages and bring the deadly remains of American soldiers back home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach by talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this full stadium, we’d have about 200 people right here,” Trump said, noting people who were right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok’s population had to move, a national emergency was not declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, which makes things a little bit more complicated," Mrs. Subung explains.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will send to Palu, they are still not sure whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Emergency Agency, explained that the authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Given that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country is still incredibly unprepared when nature unleashed its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not so many are seen in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a prior warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of cases, traveling from one Indonesian island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure the central axis of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and rail lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who faces a re-election next year.
In addition, it must cope with the pressure of Indonesia’s persistent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equals the score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at London's Stamford Bridge on Saturday.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 metres from Chelsea's goal when the scorer was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it on the second stick.
The action sent him over the area and headed to the top right corner of the grid.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell into the net.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to get me with the ball and the players like Shaq always play very forward, so I tried to give myself all the time possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I gave him a touch. I didn't think about it too much, I just shot it."
Chelsea were going to win 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues midfielder made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning around making a race near the midfield and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and came running in the middle of the field.
Then he made a nice walk to the space that led Hazard to the area.
Hazard placed in front of the defense and ended up throwing the ball to the second-post net with a left foot kick that Liverpool's Alisson Becker couldn't stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool will play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage, which will be held at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples (Italy).
For his part, Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia Tsunami death toll rises to 832
The number of casualties from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country’s emergency agency early Sunday.
Many people were trapped between the debris of buildings that collapsed during Friday’s 7.5 magnitude earthquake that triggered waves of up to six meters, according to agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with ruins of buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as murder suspect after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 am with punches in Grayson Mews, John Street, which involved the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect.
Police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to come to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented, "The investigation is in the early stages, but it would encourage anyone who has been near Jonh Street, in Birkenhead, and who has seen or heard something suspicious of contacting us.
In addition, I would recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who have been able to capture something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who believe to know the woman came to the crime scene to find out where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is under way and police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to re-enter his apartment, but police tell him that no one can get in or out of the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
Now, residents are informed that they will be allowed to re-enter in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
Don't stop repeating "it's terrible."
At two o’clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one outside.
Several agents remained standing within the cord controlling the floor block.
Anyone who has information is asked to send an email to DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, registration number 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the last commemorative success for "rewriting history"
Their ban would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: “In the current debate on the elimination of statues, it was inevitable that taking the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Westminster Palace would become a goal.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
He may be sacrificed to the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell’s Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebrating.
As Mr. Goldsmith noted to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament against external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy.
If this is a fully accurate description, it is a question of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the mid-17th century conflict has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A killer pig attacks a Chinese livestock farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut-out artery and covered in blood near a market place in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, as the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig breeder is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs from a farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pond was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the nearly 250 kilogram pig had attacked the livestock until death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeding and shattered,” he told The Guiyang Evening News after his last name, “Wu.”
Images from the security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else while police were collecting evidence on site.
It seems that Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, it’s not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 295-pound pig tied a farmer in his tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After, in 2012, pigs were eaten by an Oregon rancher, a Manitoba rancher told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of the blood can act as a “disruptor.”
"They're just playing.
They're like kids, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
All we have to do is have proper respect for them,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will leave heavy rains in the southwest of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rain throughout northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa caused more than 136 km/h of wind, a Category 1 hurricane from Sunday to five in the morning (East time) and was located almost 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean they are beginning to generate low pressures, which move east toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Lower California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to drive the intense rains from its northeast direction.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain strikes with the low pressure approaching, there will be widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous sudden flooding, streams of debris and possible debris in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause precipitation of nearly 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding may occur with conditions that are rapidly aggravating.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended to venture on foot in the desert.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into cluttered rivers and storms will cause raging winds and dust clouds locally.
Low pressures approaching will leave heavy rainfall on concrete parts of the southern coast of California.
Torrential rains may leave up to nearly two centimeters of water, which could cause small streams of debris and make roads slippery.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical bats will begin approaching Arizona at the last hour of Sunday and first hour of Monday, before the rain is generalized at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes in the U.S. will be observed due to Arctic cooling and tropical warming.
Sometimes, this involves drastic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen across the center of the U.S. on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 7 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of summer will try to recover and expand again.
In much of the center and east of the U.S. it is expected a warm beginning of October, with widespread temperatures that will round 26 degrees from the South Plain to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, temperatures in New York could reach up to 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high odds of temperatures above average for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's appearance
More than 20 million people followed the crushing testimonies that Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, gave on Thursday on six television channels.
Meanwhile, politics continued at a dead end and the media interrupted their usual schedule to retransmit Friday’s latest news: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the allegations for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judicial Commission that she is absolutely sure that Kavanaugh touched her in a state of drunkenness and that she tried to take her clothes off at a college party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was totally sure that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen on Friday are likely to have seen it.
The company accounted for the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that relayed it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some trouble calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football game of the playoffs or Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose Tertullians have strongly supported Kavanaugh's designation, fueled the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day performance, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second, with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the appearance, he continued to show great interest.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement stating that he would vote for Kavanaugh, on Friday morning CNN and CBS cameras captured how protesters yelled at him as he tried to climb an elevator to attend a court hearing.
While receiving these accusations, retransmitted live by CNN, he was shot down.
"Looking at my face," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
And he continued, “You have power when there are many women who don’t have it.”
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, that it would tell more about his presence before the Commission.
Cable TV and broadcasting channels broadcast it all live hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for it to vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate during the following week, which some Democrats had been asking for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was fundamental, as it became clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “doing politics” with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “doing politics” with Britain’s future and of undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives Congress of the Conservative Party to be held in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside her in the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on her attack on Chequers’ so-called Brexit plan, stating that a proposal for Britain and the EU to charge the other's tariffs was "totally absurd".
Wayde assassination: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree homicide charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police noted that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson’s DNA in them, according to WAFB, a CBS subsidiary.
After questioning Simpson, the police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
A security deposit of <0x24>350,000 has been established, according to the defense.
The Baton Rouge District Instruction Court published a preliminary report Friday in which it indicated that the cause of the death had been a bullet wound in the neck that had come to the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s sports director, thanked the area police for his “diligence and search for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who measured more than two metres, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game of the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "destroyed" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
“These are the things that people always worry about,” Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes in Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has arrived in the neighborhoods south of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and shakes.
On social media, images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck downtown Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police confront Catalan separatists before the anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protesters faced the riots as thousands participated in opposition demonstrations coincided with the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarized referendum on secession.
A group of captivated separatists to whom the riots had cut off the passage threw eggs and powder paint on them, creating dark dust clouds on the streets, which are normally full of tourists.
There were also clashes in later hours and the police used pores to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independentist groups, with messages like “I don’t forget or forgive”, faced unionist protesters with the cry of “Live Spain”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the October 1 vote, considered illegal by Madrid, but held by separatist Catalans.
Voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, although participation was low, as people who were against the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent voting at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes occurred.
Independence groups camped on Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but she was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we lived one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents cry for joy to be able to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital, albeit narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, the pro-Catalan parties have struggled to retain the momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders, whether in self-imposed exile or detained, are awaiting trial for their subsequent role in the referendum.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would participate in next year’s European Parliament elections.
“Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested for Wrapping a House with a Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly looting a Londonderry house in a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that damage was caused to the access and the building itself.
At some point, you may have shot the car with a bullet.
Menga Attack Gives Livingston 1-0 Victory Against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by their second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference. Gary Holt's took a position, with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard’s have not yet achieved any off-home wins and next Sunday they face the Hearts, eight-point lead.
The Rangers received the Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston has expanded its winning streak in the division to six games. Holt, head coach, hasn't tasted the defeat yet since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lets pass opportunities in front of a crowded visitor
Holt’s team had to have gone one step ahead long before scoring, causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers for their direct game.
Scott Robinson overtook the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the gate. Then, Alan Lithgow got out of the way after entering to finish Craig Halkett's head center in front of the gate.
The host team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause visitors problems with standing ball plays.
That’s how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston sought an entrance, with a combined play by Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated the possession, but they couldn’t pass the host’s defense and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
That game continued until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Allan McGregor, Rangers goalkeeper, rejected Scott Pittman's shot from one shot, and Lithgow stayed away from another play at Livingston.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly entered, but they were always empty; two penalties were rejected, one after Halkett's entry over Deputy Glenn Middleton and the other by one hand.
"Fenomenal" of Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for the Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed expectations of an upward trajectory.
His style of play and his template have barely experienced changes since his ascension, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good moments with Gerrard, they were short.
They failed to materialize the playoffs, as they only managed to get into the opposing field once, which is a call of attention to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police alleged security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers were in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to receive him in the country.
These demonstrations reflect how divisive this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was taken care of by the paramedics, but he died there.
The accident comes after another cyclist died after being stabbed by a vehicle that ran off on Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from Saturday’s crash site.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family members.
Roads have been cut off and buses have been diverted, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured After Disorder
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation in a high-security prison for men, according to the Department of the Penitentiary.
The riots began at Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, around 9:30 on Sunday and continue.
Experts from an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, in which eight inmates participate and affect a pavilion.
Officers were assisted by minor injuries to the face on the spot.
A prison service spokesman commented: “Special prison personnel have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be put in the hands of the police and could spend more time between grids.”
Long Lartin Prison hosts more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical care after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October last year anti-disorder agents were asked to go to prison to deal with a serious altercation in which prison personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It’s uncommon for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when the last hurricane Rosa pickups cross the southwest of the desert, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain at the end of Monday.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix commented in a tweet that "only ten hurricanes had maintained their tropical storm or depression status within a radius of 321 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometres from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rain, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollón Scarp, Arizona.
They are likely to fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places where there is no risk of sudden flooding, Rosa rains can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious issue, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to the drought conditions that are currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. drought monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rosa route will hit Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum bursts of 136 kilometres per hour, is 619 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north to 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to hit Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm throughout Monday afternoon.
Strong torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
"Tournal rains are expected between 7 and 15 centimeters from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimeters," according to weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. Later, she will travel through Arizona south of Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or its remains is heavy torrential rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora and southwest of the U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden flooding and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempt to Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy have been arrested as suspects of attempted murder after they found another 16-year-old with white gun wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 p.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Avon, according to Somerset Police.
Agents have made a call to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile.
Trump Says Kavanaugh “suffered the ugliness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“Voting in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and outrageous Democratic Party tactics,” Trump said at a rally held in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has “suffered the ugliness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of sexually assaulting her decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, “the Americans saw Kavanaugh’s astuteness, quality and courage.”
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our day, a lawyer with a admirable history at the service of the public,” he told his West Virginia followers.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t present myself, but it’s a race,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going from one place to another fighting to get great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats are embarking on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to be held no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number is on the rise
At least 384 people have been killed and many have been dragged by the huge waves that sunk the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at night, dragging many to death and destroying everything in its passage.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When yesterday it was warned that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Agency for the Management of Disasters (BNPB) in a press conference in Yakar in Indonesia.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, sunk everything that was on the ground," commented Nugroho. The tsunami had moved by the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s Great Earthquake was 200 times higher than the atomic bomb that fell over Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of the demolished buildings, in addition, 540 people had been wounded and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of casualties and damage could be greater along the 300km coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closest to the earthquake’s epicenter.
The communications “were totally paralyzed and there was no information” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials say the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a footage captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man is heard standing on the last floor of a building warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a water wall hits the coast, taking buildings and cars in front.
Reuters was unable to validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major shutdown that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but evacuated people still need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescue tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia’s tsunami death toll is more than 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although the World Vision staff in Donggala has arrived safely and safely in the city of Palu, where employees take refuge under canvases installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, Doseba said.
“They told me they had seen many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even while aid groups were launching disaster assistance gears, some people complained that the displacement of experienced collaborators to Palu was not allowed.
According to Indonesian legislation, funding, supplies and staffing of foreign personnel can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
“As soon as the government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it has not yet happened.”
When the second night fell in Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of the people who were still missing still had the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would give some light to the devastating stories written by natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, instructor of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier that month in Indonesia.
Other of those who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mr. Mandagi included, were his students.
“By my experience in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the disclosure of the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors, who were participating in the festival held on the beach.
However, their messages showed only a gray check mark, not two in blue.
“I think that means the messages didn’t deliver,” he said.
Thieves take away <0x24>26,750 during a recharge of an ATM at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, robbers raided a Brink employee who reloaded an ATM in Newport on the Levee, taking <0x24>26,750, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located in the leisure center and was preparing to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man “approached himself running behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money destined for the recharge.
According to the note, there were witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West will start calling himself Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: “The person formerly known as Kanye West.”
A long time ago, 41-year-old West was nicknamed Ye, a name he used as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons", as the show's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance to him.
"I think it's the most widely used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," West commented earlier this year while talking about the album's title with radio speaker Big Boy.
"It's you, it's us, it means us.
He became Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad, and confusing things, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
It is one of the many famous rappers whose name has been changed.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in capital or minuscules, with or without script.
The Mexican AMLO pledges not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the Mexican president-elect, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that he would "never use the army to repress the people of Mexico".
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were tightening across Latin America.
López Obrador has committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving them monthly grants to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to integrate into criminal gangs.
U.S. should double I.A. funding
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an I.A. investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after the I.A.-related announcements from several parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the No. 1 in innovation in IA by 2030.
“Double the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, since all the other countries go far behind the U.S. We have the view set on the next advance in the field of I.A.”
Double funding means double the likelihood that the next big achievement in I.A. will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by editorial Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's leading I.A. companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that beat Othello's best American player. Later, he was executive at Microsoft Research and chairman of the Google subsidiary in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be the next one, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking the academic leaders; it's the corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent people from universities to work at I.A.
Lee commented that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. intensify its initiatives in I.A.
“I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically,” he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China finances people from academic institutions just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations finance U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to attract industrial and academic partners. For its part, the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than <0x24>100 million a year in I.A. research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that tried to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not carried out any action in months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether to change their country’s name
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum held on Sunday about whether their name would change to "Republic of North Macedonia", a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their candidate for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor’s name is a claim of its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav population, the majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has questioned whether participation will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum paper asked the following question: "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote for it to be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been notified at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their vote.
“I’ve come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko cast their vote in the Macedonian referendum on a name change that would open the way for NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament, in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and removing chairs in front of the tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with our heads up, not by the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that accession to NATO would contribute to the investment that Macedonia so much needs, whose unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said a positive result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Institute of Policy Research stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is less than the required participation.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV, from Macedonia, revealed that 57 percent of respondents had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50% plus a vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious coup to the pro-Western government policy since it came to power in May last year.
See this: Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero skips all of Brighton’s defense to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling regained Brighton's defense in the 2-0 win that Manchester City won on Saturday at Manchester's Etihad Stadium, England.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a pass in the midfield at the start of the game.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before entering the open field.
Once there, he was seen surrounded by four green shirts.
He evaded a defense before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit him with the right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the net.
"Agüero has some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very much within the territory of Brighton.
He made a nice left flank ball pass for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few touches before directing Sterling toward the second pole.
The forward of the Sky Blues dropped the ball to the net just before he went out of bounds.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to water the Rockies party
With the Nationals removed from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to climb the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, triumphed against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League’s Western Division, they still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still pursuing their first division title.
“Although we don’t play at all, at least we can kick the tyre with the certainty that the Denver audience will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I’ve faced this year.
Why wouldn’t you want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce an opener for Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to let Scherzer go in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his opening number 34, made a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The record of the Washington dystro is 18 victories and 7 defeats, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 entries.
Trump at a meeting in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is at stake.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important choices in our lives.
It’s one of the most important ones. I don’t present myself, but it’s a race, so I’m going from one place to another fighting for great candidates.”
“We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all necessary means, we see mischief, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, are embarking on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“We’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, saying the Democrats “were angry, they were bad, horrible and fake.”
He referred to the Senate Judicial Commission by appointing Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the abuses from the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I'm hoping for an answer. Her body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already encompasses a wide range of opinions.
It is intolerant to people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was barely surprised.
After all, I am the last of a row of Labour MPs to be told that it is not welcome, and just to say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated like being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, on Europe. It is ironic that these were issues in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the meeting of the Nottingham East Labour Party on Friday, “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years I have been a Member of the Parliament of the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and kind" policy is now more than forgotten, if it has actually been implemented at some point.
It is increasingly clear that dissenting opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged based on whether or not the party leaders consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect that he would radically change his mind and adopt positions with which he would never have agreed, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a diatribe of insults on social media demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, saying that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one who has experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a stream of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with every “censorship” motion or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I have received many advice that recommended keeping my head down and not making me hear so much and that would be “well.”
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since 32 years ago I joined the Labour Party as a high school student, motivated by the negligence of Thatcher’s government that left the classroom of my entire school literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, either as a councillor or as a government minister.
I have never concealed my political ideas, nor have I concealed my political ideas in the last elections.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to know my political stances or the areas in which I did not agree with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted Friday’s motion is that I don’t understand this desire to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader when the country headed for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for voters, whether from the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will stop me from acting according to what I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an invincible Ayr rises to the top
Two rehearsals at the end of the game may have decided to some extent the final result, but, undoubtedly, Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining Tennent's Premiership day game.
They are now in the top of the table and it is the only invincible team of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to better take advantage of the opportunities, which gave the victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
"We've been tested in all games and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, commented: “The Ayr deserves recognition, they took better chances than us.”
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed the Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors loan for the game, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this drawback of the opponent and Jason Baggot did not get one.
Climo expanded Ayr's advantage with a penalty. Before, just in the middle of time, he scored and turned a solo trial, leaving the scorer in favor of Ayr at 17-5 at rest.
However, the Melrose started well the second part and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, whom they had to pull on a camel, and, as the game resumed, the Ayr advanced with an essay by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed Melrose again to take advantage of having another man with an unconverted essay by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for scoring Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made an assay when he was in the back of the mall that was advancing.
Climo converted it, as he had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent the wing of Gregor Henry to the bottom to do the locals' fifth rehearsal.
Still Game protagonist wants to direct his career towards the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, the protagonist of Still Game, appears determined to move into the restaurant sector after revealing that he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC show, which writes and co-stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to make any comments on the matter, although a Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s “flowing restoration market.”
"The sea belongs to us": a coastless Bolivia has hopes that the court reopens the path to the Pacific
Marines monitor a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings there are blue sea flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the slogan: "The sea belongs to us by right,
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a land without seas, they still vividly remember the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the desire to resettle the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits an International Court of Justice resolution by October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the drive, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the International Court of Justice's ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has the obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who waged a controversial re-election battle next year, also has a lot to say about Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final allegations indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have haunted her.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
In addition, he suggested that Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have conversations after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “ending 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime theme as a political mule.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to end nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume diplomatic talks over three months after this summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri notes that the continuation of continued sanctions and the U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War to subdue the North is a "quimera".
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament move.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s seriousness of renouncing an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit among the officials.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a set of large-sized eccentric hats for their spring summer 2019 collection in the hallway, stunning the style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the tunnel.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that wrapped the models’ heads.
Other large-sized accessories were jewelry sandwiches, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of stunning masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than the high seam.
One creation resembled a complete diving team, snorkelling and glasses included, while another resembled a melted ice cone.
If you like big-sized fashion, you are lucky.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could begin to be seen on the streets of shops.
The large hats come with a strong hand-picked "The Bomb", with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this so impractical hat that flooded social media presented another great creation on the passageway: a beach bag of straw as big as the bath model that wore it.
The dark orange rafia bag, decorated with rags and a white leather wing, was the main piece of the collection La Riviera de Jacquemus for the spring-summer 2019 season at the Paris Fashion Week.
As famous designer Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge hats and beach bags on the shopping streets. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language Skills are Fundamental for the Citizens of the World
Scottish independent educational centres have a trajectory of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in exams that is reinforced by individual and collective successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is noted that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in the centers.
As Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, it reaches to his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year’s exams, we can note that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest approval rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received an A, the highest score.
The data, collected from the 74 centres that form part of the SCIS, showed that 72% of students received an A in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages by considering them as a fundamental competence that both children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, it is considered that, as a subject, languages are at the same level as the subjects of CTIM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17% of employers’ reasons for difficulties in filling jobs were attributed to a lack of linguistic skills.
Therefore, linguistic skills are increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
Possible job opportunities requiring languages are on the rise, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will enable that person to automatically advance to the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation. Also, it was established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for children today.
If they speak several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better chances of finding a quality job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centers will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages taught by teachers specializing in this subject.
Scotland’s independent educational centres devote all their efforts to provide a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds for them.
At present, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages still have a vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "competents for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges
LeBron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting for fans to see LeBron James debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the opening game of the pre-season that will be held Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a few minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-match pre-season program.
“At this stage of my career I don’t need pre-season games to prepare myself,” he said.
Trump's time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s five scheduled rallyes for next week, including stops in places with supporters like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his candidate’s confirmation vote to fill the vacancy in the pending Supreme Court, Trump intends to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s mitin in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s mitin in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online through a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s appearances of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who have been strained over allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and have waited for an early confirmation vote by the Senate for as long as a week as the FBI investigates them.
However, the main goal of this series of rallyes is to help Republicans who face the November elections take a step forward.
President Trump’s campaign said next week’s five rally aims to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial to its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at Wheeling’s Wesbanko Arena stadium, the evening’s mitin could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as have coverage in the Pittsburgh media,” as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is being resigned in the polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has to come to give him a push in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team demonstrates that it dares to fight to keep hope alive for Sunday’s individual matches.
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pulse pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept, but players really believe in it, even more in competitions like these.
So, where would you say the momentum is now?
“We had six points ahead and now we have four, so I guess that can be considered a small boost,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have some wind in favor and reasons to be excited, among other reasons for the pair formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and scored three points out of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and preaches with example.
Celebration guttural screams rose as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to kick the fourth game as he and Thomas went down two after two holes.
The putt that gave them the game on the 15th was received with a similar scream, from those who transmit that they believe the American team has not yet been left out.
"What needs to be done to redouble efforts and focus on the game," Spieth said.
That’s what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and lovely couple from Europe has four out of four and nothing can go wrong with them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That streak and the way its energy flows with the tumultuous public makes it clear that these are the players to be defeated on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, the two at the same time in different holes.
Yet it is still premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson released Sergio García, the four-ball hero of the morning, after forming a pair with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they couldn’t get out.
But there will be no help on Sunday to get out of the holes.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see them closely because they appreciate the interactions between couples, the tips they give and the ones they don’t, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big advantage over the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe advances by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe leaves with a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a score of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated duo composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two wins over a troubled Tiger Woods, ahead of four points in the Le Golf National ranking.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to shorten distances.
American Jim Furyk needs eight points out of Sunday’s 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, who received the nickname of "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, his magnificent union served to defeat a discouraged Woods and American novice Bryson Decahmbeau by a 5-4 round.
Woods, who hadn’t highlighted much in Saturday’s two games, had occasional moments of brightness, but has now lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes games, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning fourballs, was again Henrik Stenson's pair on the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world, respectively, with a score of 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have everything on its side.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a benchmark for the Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They achieved an exciting 2-1 victory against Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovering from a four-point difference in individual matches has only happened twice, although Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs a draw to keep it.
Although they’ve been the second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond your chances.
North Korea says “there is no possibility” that they will disarm first unilaterally if they have no confidence
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of the sanctions deepened his distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility for his country to unilaterally give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho stated before the annual General Assembly of the international body that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we have not received any similar response from the United States," he said.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t have confidence in our national security, and in those circumstances, there is no possibility that we disarm ourselves unilaterally first.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phase-by-phase” denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important, as it did not without further a unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work in favor of the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose coercively, even by objecting to a declaration of end of war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri made no mention of the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced at a bomb and plateau by the U.S. leader before the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and Moon Jae, South Korea’s leader, over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea had been the party involved in denuclearization rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in a slump.”
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea’s missiles toward U.S. soil after “malicious President” Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim “a rocket man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in advancing disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that it was necessary to continue applying sanctions until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no set deadline for this: “We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its advances.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without breach until we make final and fully verified denuclearization a reality.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July saying there had been advances, but a few hours later, North Korea denounced that its “requirements were those of a mafia.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the "corresponding measures".
He said Kim had informed him that the "corresponding measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take a Course on How to Rest Enough
Thanks to a new course that is being taught at Harvard University this year, all college students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
A professor discovered that the world’s number one university students often have no idea about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, is believed to be the first of its kind in the U.S.
Their motivation to start the course came after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl approached me and asked me why she just learned about this now, in her last year.
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of dreaming, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts about how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and the university’s executive director of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students barely slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of setting up a sleeping routine.
In another section, participants are informed how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of students right away.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” Professor Czeisler added.
He stated that the culture of pride for “sleeping the night” still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure that students are subjected to meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping long enough and good quality sleep should be students’ “secret weapon” to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, which is why they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the year before during his first year at Harvard.
He noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to extend it to the entire campus.
Expect that the next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler’s recommendation is for students to think about putting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by the displays of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter the circadian rhythms, so that they end up having problems.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: the goal of Menga tomb to Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another out-of-home depression episode, when Dolly Menga's attack drove Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox wanted to get their first home win since the February 4–1 victory at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard's team for the second time in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team eight-point Hearts, knocked out leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga’s attack occurred felt minutes before the half-time and the uninspired alignment of the Rangers was not up at any time.
Now, the Rangers drop to sixth place, the Livingston rises to third, behind the Hibernian by the goal difference.
The Rangers may have more trouble, as line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after someone allegedly dropped an object from the visiting background.
Gerrard changed to eight of the titles that won the game against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
For his part, Holt pulled out the 11 players from Livingston who scored a point at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his organizational team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but the Livingston took better advantage of the ball when they had it.
They should have scored two minutes from the start, when Menga made a space pass for Scott Pittman who passed between the defensive, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs made a deep deficiency for Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to send her out on the long pole.
The Rangers regained control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but referee Steven Thomson made deaf ears at the Colombian’s request.
The Rangers scored two goalkeeper shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely in difficulty dealing with Lassana Coulibaly's headline and Ovie Ejaria's boring launch.
Although the goal scored in the 34th minute by Livingston came against any prognosis, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers did not manage to cope with a deep ball-stopping play by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fit the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed Menga to score the goal.
During the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact as the steering wheel passed it to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly stepped out of his line to block him.
Still, the Livingston continued to take visitors exactly to the type of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long pass after another.
Holt's might have taken more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor remained firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a corner of head that did not enter.
Ranger's replacement, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a meeting with Jacobs, but again, Thomson looked to the other side.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTANDO... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since been a pillar of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bells of Crown", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of vaqueros scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears its name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a protein common to many cancers and reinject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw how her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer," such as breast, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “teaching them” to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a Trump-backed diatribe with a MAGA hat after his appearance in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was abused in the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would run for president in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the cap with the message Make America Great Again, he began to depotricate against the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white person and ask how I like Trump if he’s racist.
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the Matt Damon sketch show in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judicial Committee in connection with the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not retransmitted, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the West Bronze recording to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the public that he had had a bad time behind the scenes for wearing that hat.
"They met with me.
They told me not to go out with the hat.
They met with me!
And then they tell me I’m asleep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how sleepy I am?" and added, "I was going to put on his superman coat, because that meant no one could tell him what he had to do.
Try it with love.”
His comments received public abuses on at least two occasions and SNL members seemed to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: "The study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West shocked many when he went on stage to sing I Love it dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from TPUSA Conservative leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING BEFORE THE MUCHEDUMBER."
Karen Hunter, the host of an interview program, tweeted that West was simply “sitting himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I decide not to reward someone (buying his music or his clothes, or supporting his art) who I consider to be embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology to my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed, saying he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, following the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the missing music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Indictment for attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington, Game of Thrones star, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO, Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the male hero stereotype, saying that those screen roles often transmitted to young boys who had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones distributor comrade Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that it seems "pretty important" to address this issue.
“Personally, it seems quite important to me at this point, where have we wronged ourselves with masculinity?” he said.
“What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they see now?”
Kit believes that television can be part of the responsibility for growing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the great questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not take part in any Game of Thrones prequel or sequel when the series ends next summer, stating that it is "a battlefield and horse race."
Starting in November, Kit will star in True West, Sam Shepard’s theatrical play that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he’s ever gotten out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so in that sense, she has given me my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on a family estate in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has declined virtually entirely, the Chinese health authorities said at a congress in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases to about 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the LGTB community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGTB collective suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are because they do not use adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff filters data from Republican senators and claims it is “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Representative Maxine Waters criticised Saturday’s allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia’s pages on legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat said these allegations were driven by “extreme right” commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more vile lies," Waters said in a tweet.
The information reportedly included addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol posted information on the Internet during a Senate panel session on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct made against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The filtration was carried out at some point after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters office and made the data of a Waters staff member public, according to the Capitol.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was not at all responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters' statement sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"Dismiss this information with anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that not the temperament needed to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
You mustn't rebel.
You must not question the prosecutor's motives.
It must keep calm and serenity.”
It seems Fleischer wanted to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused of looking too angry during Thursday's appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intends to ban Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “relevant authorities and law enforcement entities to these fraudulent allegations.”
“We will make sure that the authors are discovered, and that they are legally held responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff.”
Johnny English Review: Back in action. Rowan Atkinson's spy parody shortens
Now it has become a tradition to look for Brexit clues in any new film with a British approach. It seems that this is what it corresponds to doing with this new release of the action and comedy parodic franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this ironic self-taught about how clearly stupid we are the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyebrows and his inexpressible face, has renewed his license to put the leg for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinematic territories.
Of course, it’s the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange pretensions to tear down the glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a piece of that kind that played a single note on the theme of Fire Carts that was played at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, his origin was based on the mysterious traveler and international man represented by Atkinson years ago in Barclaycard’s already forgotten television ads, seeding the chaos behind him.
In this last delivery, there are one or two good moments.
I loved to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor as the helix collided against the helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy jumps into sight, but the humor remains quite short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that “serious” movie franchises like 007 and Mission Impossible add comic ingredients without problems.
The humor seems more directed to children than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s absurd misfortunes are not as ingenious and right as Atkinson’s silent jokes in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument of today is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has infiltrated Britain’s supersecret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents in the face of the consternation of the agent in service, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous and sloppy character who’s watching her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this character who’s almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn’t leave much room for work.
His intelligence advisers inform you that, as all active spies are in danger, you will have to resort to someone who is retired.
That must be the torpedo Johnny English, who now teaches in a pussy school, although it gives extra-official lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a rock school-like spying academy.
English is relocated to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with his suffering former compinche Bough, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a nice role for which Vicki Pepperdine is not taken enough advantage.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in His Majesty’s Secret Service return to action, with the deadly beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous claws of a multi-millionaire charismatic tech world who claims she can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash chaos hiding in the luxurious yacht of Volta; in addition, English becomes a pure anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality helmet to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta house.
Definitely, they were thoroughly employed in that last sequence, but, no matter how funny and streaky, the ensemble continues to convey a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
Like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but wonder if the British film industry could give Rowan Atkinson a role that would make true justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but it charges five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but would charge five.
The party supposedly wants the owners of the companies to allocate the savings obtained through the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers, giving them an additional free day.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would “fit” on the party’s economic plans and agenda to incline the country in favor of workers.
This change in a four-day week has received support from the Trade Union Congress, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official commented to The Sunday Times: A revision of the directive is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not be achieved from day to day, but the four-day working week is definitely a matter that the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the party’s general industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to back such ideas, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
At the moment, however, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not part of the party’s policy and will not be discussed at this time.”
Shadow Treasury Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference held last week to expose his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to regain the powers of “anonymous” and “exploited directors” from companies providing public services.
The minister’s plans in the shadow also include the idea that current shareholders of water companies will not recover their full participation, since a Labour government could apply deductions corresponding to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on the boards of directors of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds in which 10% of private sector companies’ shares must be allocated to employees, which would mean annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “60 Minutes” about the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could make them change their mind
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for confirmation as Supreme Court judge for at least one week and raises the question of whether the results that are concluded could influence any Republican senator who finally decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could bring out information that made them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course, of course," Kennedy said.
"I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, that the allegation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He showed himself firm, resolved, titan."
Graham’s vote, however, seems immutable.
"I already have a decision taken around Brett Kavanaugh and I would overlook the charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it tightly," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she appoints have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It’s always the same, I don’t see anything new in this case.”
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive star sign meets in favor of an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people moving to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event: ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you can pay for a VIP ticket), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteers, send emails to a world leader, make a phone call, or anything else that ends up serving their conscience.
However, what has Global Citizen achieved after 12 years of reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just a form of so-called “clickivism,” which is called the posture we adopt when we believe we are doing something really useful when signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse targets.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have made global leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than <0x24>37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2,250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its shares, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly influenced nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", an association of UK-based investors and executives united with the common commitment to "help children grow and develop with all their potential". To this end, it has been proposed to provide Rwanda with <0x24>35 million to help end global malnutrition tweets from the country's 4-plus ciber-recipient.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens collaborators like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for “The Power of Nutrition,” told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after carrying out more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen collaborator responded: “It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But as the human rights movements have already achieved in the past and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the performances we’ll have at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy to carry out the blockade of Russia's energy exports
"If necessary," Washington could resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including that of the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates at legitimate government instances, is nothing more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the most southern supplier to Europe," he said.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
“The United States, with its Navy, has the ability to ensure that the sea routes remain open and, if any, could even block them to ensure that the energy does not end in the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the "power consumer voice" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
“The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he warned, while indicating that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made when the Trump administration has been trying to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and relevance of its function to Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration members, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is worth <0x24>11 billion and is expected to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project responds only to economic reasons and is a more unjust example of competition.
“I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russia’s Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry last September.
The American stance has, however, met with Germany’s rejection, who has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s industry-leading organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in the EU’s energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will look closely at the possibility of running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would consider joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During an appearance at Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being put forward.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to amend our broken government and to finally have women among the leaders,” she said.
“After November 6, I’m going to seriously consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren gave his opinion about President Donald Trump during a hearing in the City Hall and said he was “guiding the country on the wrong path.”
"I'm really worried about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke without hesitation about Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “It is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote.”
A poll was published on Thursday in which, however, a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should run for the 2020 election.
58% of Massachusetts’ “possible” voters said the senator should not be present, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% of respondents, however, supported their candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38% support for a possible candidate and 48% against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible 2020 nomination of former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said it would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress disorder in a Donald Trump myth
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation that my son is going through, by all that has happened since he returned, is well known to other families suffering from the effects of TEPT and other injuries our soldiers are returning with,” he told the public at a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the big taboo nobody wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "return with different behavior, hardened, wondering whether there really exists that respect for what his fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of his army, have given to their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to get a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives from 18 states and the district presented a "friendly" letter Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been revealed in the "Grace v. Sessions" case filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against federal policy.
She said her partner "and her children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states who defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the U.S., as nations facing widespread domestic and gang-related problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) by which undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in the country.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine made statements Friday stating that the new policy “ignores decades of international, federal and state law.”
"According to federal law, all asylum applications must be failed on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the lawsuit and, instead, this exception violates that principle," says the amicus curiae.
Lawyers also pointed out in the paper that the policy denying entry to immigrants is damaging the U.S. economy by claiming that they often become entrepreneurs more often and “suppose a necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“People who leave their countries of origin may seek asylum on grounds of persecution or threats by race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, faced daily by people around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of dead increases in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly nefarious.
“The situation is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while trying to comfort her baby with fever in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search among the few plundered belongings left to them in an effort to recover what was possible.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, also damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are crowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has his back and shoulder broken, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to continuous, also very strong replicas.
I couldn’t help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he lived while on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to get safe.
I was trapped in the remains of the broken wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press. He and his family were in town to celebrate a wedding.
“I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congress elections, something China roundly denies.
Trump’s accusation of Beijing’s attempt to influence U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials pointed out to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign launched by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels on imports by both sides.
China’s countervailing tariffs that were applied at the beginning of the trade war were thought to fall back on exporters from states like Iowa, which backed the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, who is one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
According to Branstad in an opinion article in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, China “is intensifying that pressure even further with advertisements in our free press.”
“To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the precious American tradition of freedom of expression and the free press by trying to publish a payment announcement on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few discrepancy voices and no real reflection of the different opinions that people in China can have about the worrying trajectory that is taking the economy of their country, as the media is controlled by the strong pressure of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most relevant newspapers ignored the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts note that Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the mid-term vote with Kavanaugh’s debacle
As many renowned Republicans are closing rows in favor of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh against various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there may be a backlash, especially by women, in the upcoming mid-term votes.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and many Republicans have expressed their desire to move forward with the vote.
"In this kind of matters, it is not possible to go backwards," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the latest attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to position himself in favor of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm voters displeased with the matter.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the MoveOn group, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters gathered at the Senate doors chanted "November is coming!" (November is coming soon!) at the time when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine For Blase.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats comes out of all prognosis,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say the repercussions are already very relevant, and indeed they are.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the indecisive women in the outskirts and the younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who don’t usually vote even though they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which he detailed his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that a backlash could occur if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"This issue has become a major mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s no longer just a matter of the committee’s vote or the final vote, not even of whether they sit on the bench at Kavanaugh; it’s also about how Republicans have handled all this and how they’ve treated it to it,” said Guy Cecil, director of aid to the US Priorities group.
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who they should believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, though they are a few more who stand on the side of the latter.
In a new YouGov survey, 41 percent of respondents say they believe Ford’s testimony definitively or likely, while 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh definitively or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that, most likely or definitively, Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s statements, as well as at least those of another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her while being drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest technology legend project, a company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “dominated the world.”
“It has to be now,” he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology so that users can create their own "online personal data storage" or a POD.
It can contain lists, pending task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
One thing that is unique in personal online data storage is that the user decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes, and skills needed for Solid to reach everyone.
At the moment, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the template developers who were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers from around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a radical change where all of their business models are completely modified from day to day.
"We're not going to ask for permission."
Berners-Lee wrote on Inrupt on Saturday that “his mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on net neutrality.
Despite even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this upcoming web age,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victory Cross in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew he had been awarded the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made him worthy of his grandfather's decoration.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann guided his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons."
He then ran to the fire line and, with the "best courage", made the line forward before reaching a cannon with one hand and knocking down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “so great that I could never get to his height, but they were very aligning.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, which featured the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was "a whole privilege for him to be a part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero remains clear when shown such a number of backups."
MMA followers were awake all night for Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine you stay awake all night to see the entire Bellator 206 so that in the end you will not be allowed to see the main event.
The San José cartel had 13 fights, six included on the main card, and in the UK it was going to be broadcast live overnight on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, UK viewers were stunned when the show changed to Peppa Pig.
Some weren’t surprised after they had to stay awake until early in the morning just to see the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the change to cartoons as "a heavy joke".
“There is a government regulation that regulates content that is broadcast from 6 p.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, when we asked him about the broadcast.
"Peppa la pigitata, yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they will modify the program to include British viewers in the upcoming editions.
“When I think of the retransmission option, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn’t do it until Sunday at our time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're looking at how to do it.
Believe me, when the schedule was changed, a lot of messages were received and not all were friendly, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we normally did. We tried to offer more than usual for the fans to be happy and have fun.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels Lower for Sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was in turn what motivated him to become a triumphant.
At the age of 24, she told us she didn’t realize until she got to high school that “not everyone was like me.”
In the first Desert Island Discs program of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention when talking about gay rights was to convey “hope” to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him become more important in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of this legendary program, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley, who showed himself as a marginalized, commented that he felt "lesser" than the rest during his childhood, because "it was not socially acceptable that you liked boys and girls."
“Until today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what really gave me the power and strength to triumph.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he claimed, so he wasn’t disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year’s Commonwealth Games held in Australia to demand that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
She said she told him because she felt fortunate to live in freedom, without retaliation, and wanted to convey that “hope” to other people.
The three-time world champion stated that it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year to the Oscar winner, who has been 20 years, though he specifies that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so young" (it was his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have turned around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is undoubtedly Robbie.”
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked is if they had tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I was not able to tell him that I was not going to be able to be in the front row,” he said.
“I had his hand between my hands when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until that very moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“At that moment I knew that that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of my own at the Olympic Games, there was nothing better,” he said.
This was also the one that inspired her to choose her first song, Proud by Heather Small, which accompanied her in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, stayed on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to reverse his form if he wants to prevent it from becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the event held every two years to achieve a record for the 12th time, was knocked out by Captain Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has done so many times for the United States, the five-time major tournament champion had to be content with cheering at some moments and, in others, trying to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to rectify what afflicts him.
Never the most direct of the drivers, not even at the highest point of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best form for the Le Golf National field, where the long rough punishes continuously with wrong kicks.
And, if the field is no longer discouraged enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below at the start of the 12 individual games, started in an impressive way, Mickelson’s game could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, nor could he say much more.
"He perfectly understood the role I had today, gave me a palm on my back and, surrounding me with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn’t think of it playing two games.
I thought they would be more, but that’s how it came out and that’s how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of us.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will outperform Nick Faldo's mark of more Ryder Cup matches.
It could be the last of a whole Ryder Cup career that had never so clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence brought much more intangible values to the team.
“It’s fun, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to joke about others; it’s great to have him on the team,” he explained.
"I think the younger players have loved to have it as support, too, this week; it was fun.
It brings a lot more than just playing.”
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that even if you get in with a substantial advantage in the final days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to finish with the others by pushing their heels by a minimum margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"Don't forget we made a big tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and we lost, we did it in Valderrama and we won, but for very little," Bjorn, portrayed, said after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday leading it with a 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story will teach me and everyone that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Go out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are on the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, that is to win this trophy, and that’s the only thing we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we’re very aware of what’s on the other side where they are, no more or less, than the best players in the world.”
Proud of what his players have done on a very hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to move forward.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are individual performances and this is different.
It’s great to share what happens with a colleague when things go well, but when you’re there alone, you’re testing all your skills as a golfer.
That’s the message you need to convey to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it’s up to you to leave your partner aside, go and get the best out of yourself.”
Faced with Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than they did as couples, with the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points to four.
The same Furyk has been on both ends in the last days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team that won at Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe carried out the "Milagre of Medinah".
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
"We have 12 super-important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls in those intermediate games.
We defined our strategy and made them feel like we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
“I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the entire route,” Bjorn said of his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy fragata should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old ships of the Cold War era, but it will not be done until at least the next year due to defective systems and the progressive increase in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship heading the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit a statement from a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery hampered the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class fragatas.
We know they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continuous delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project their power overseas) to be outdated when they begin to service, Die Zeit says.
The unlucky F125 fleet occupied owners last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known of the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial “software and hardware defects” that left the ship practically useless if it was sent to a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half of the staff in the former Bremen class fragatas.
It was also found that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future updates.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as other similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, has also posed a problem.
It is believed to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3,1 billion (<0x24>3,6 billion), instead of the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>22,2 billion.
The problems attributed to the new fragatas are of particular relevance in light of recent warnings on the reduction of the naval power of Germany.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy is “leading without ships capable of deploying.”
The officer said the problem has been aggravating over time, because the old boats were dropped, but they have not been replaced by others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies the secret life of the moths
This new research, which has been conducted in a state of the Scottish Highlands, tries to find out how cockroaches use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything we learn is expected to shed more light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and help guide upcoming conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and soprano moths, as well as the Daubenton coastal moths and long-eared browns of the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to track the activities of the moths during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds collected in the recordings to find out the frequency of calls from the butterflies and what species they do.
A report and a habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, expects the results to reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to butterflies and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and how forests should be maintained for cockroaches and other associated species.
The populations of frogs in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as well as insecticidal papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks of domestic cats.
The squirrels are not really blind,
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated eco-localization technique that locates ants and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the subject of squirrels very seriously.
He has ten skilled experts in the field, who regularly carry out surveys, nest inspections and, at times, rescues.
The organization has even inaugurated the first and only reserve dedicated to Scots sharks in the State of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten shark species.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, at Threave, we have a fantastic area for cockroaches," he said.
“We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the right habitat.
However, there’s still a lot of unknown things about sharks, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.”
It stresses the importance of checking if there are molluscs before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, as a breeding colony can be involuntaryly destroyed and 400 females and boys could be killed, which would mean annihilating an entire local population.
Butterflies are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
“We still have a lot to learn about cockroaches and many other species that we don’t know how their populations evolve,” he said.
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers prosecute German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has cataloged rape allegations as “fake news” and says people “wanted to make themselves known” at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The head of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying him <0x24>375,000 to hide the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already accumulated 142 million followers hours after the news was published, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the report “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false,” says the five-time Golden Ball winner looking at the camera.
“They just want advertising at the expense of my name.
It's the same story as always.
They want to be famous with just mentioning me, but that’s how I can’t avoid it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations that they have called “an unacceptable report of suspicions in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will try to get compensation for “moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident appears to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents recorded at the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo fell down after the alleged incident and told him that he was in a “99 percent” a “good boy” and that he had disappointed that “one percent” remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consenting.
Mayorga also claims he went to the police and took photographs of the wounds at the hospital, but later agreed to reach an extrajudicial settlement because he had “terrorist retaliation” and was concerned “to be humiliated in public”.
The 34-year-old woman says she is trying to cancel the deal, as she is still traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer has changed to Juve, an Italian football major for a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: the UK would always regret losing car manufacturers <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The UK would "repent for life" if it lost its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" Toyota UK to tell the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, production would temporarily stop at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said the repercussions of customs delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production cuts in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have expressed their fears about leaving the EU without an agreement, especially with regard to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are revolving around the problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is based on the “just in time” mode, where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to manufacture custom cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement on March 29, there could be a breakdown at the border that, according to the sector, could result in delays and depletion of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to host the amount of material equivalent to more than one day of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and in that case production would stop.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan, where future relations with the EU are established, is “precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at border crossings.”
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that not only allows us to get out of the way right now but we have to take advantage of the opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence from Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue with what, so far, has been a tremendously successful supply chain set.”
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run, the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately cost.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the Unite trade union at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put in place a precise and convincing plan in which our future relations with the EU are defined.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "deposed another week" as the dispute over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian elections, links between Trump’s and Russia’s aid, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Expectations before whether Trump decides to fire the Deputy Attorney General or not, and thus compromise Mueller’s independence has fed Washington’s cobblers for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the conversations he had with Trump with a microphone he himself carried to try to relegate the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, among news reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was at the United Nations at the time in New York) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh for a week, though this would delay the vote of the Senate plenary.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, he said: “No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We’ll decide on the march and I’ll go and tell the press how I usually do it.”
Some journalists would refute this claim: Sanders has not held any press conference at the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said the shortage of press wheels was not due to an aversion to TV journalists who act grossly, although he said, “I will not disagree with the fact that they fanfarrone.”
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president conducts more questions and answers than any other president before him,” he said, citing without evidence: “We have contrasted those numbers.”
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the option of asking directly to the President of the United States, I think it’s a lot better than doing it to me.
We’ve tried to do it many times and you’ve seen us do it many times in recent weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump usually answers questions when he goes to the White House or when he attends public meetings or press conferences with the dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him only happen on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why it was so, where he made an unfamiliar, and sometimes bizarre appearance to the journalists who were gathered there.
The Secretary of State for Health writes to EU NHS Scotland workers about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working at Scotland’s HHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire to continue with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in non-central government utilities.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit in which she opted to make the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the UK government has also intensified preparations around a possible scenario in which there would be no agreement.
I know all this must be very confusing to you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, irrespective of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries provide valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service, which benefits patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we would love to continue counting on you.”
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers player, was surgically intervened in an emergency after suffering a head injury last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee’s Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
“I came to the band and crashed right there,” Reed said.
Both the trainers and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before putting it on a cam and taking it to a thorough examination.
A Tennessee State staff member told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he added a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will be charged a higher land transfer tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a higher land transfer tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised by this measure will be used to give shelter to the “stop”, according to the new plans of the Conservatives.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s offensive to attract younger voters
Increased land transfer tax will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year that will be allocated to the “dackless”
The additional money raised by the increase in the tax on land transfers to foreign buyers of property in the UK will be earmarked for aid to the “homeless,” Theresa May announced today.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is harvesting with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger and harassing voters to those with higher incomes.
Increased tax on land transfers will be charged to non-taxable people and businesses in the UK and that money will be intended to encourage government policy to combat the problem of street mendicity.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the buy-to-let system, could reach up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s newly built properties are purchased by non-residents in the UK, causing higher prices and making it difficult for people to access affordable housing for the first time.
Many of the country's most prosperous areas (especially in the capital) have become "fantasy cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in transmission tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping very high prices on the property by greedy buying land without intent to use it and urged Ms. May to eliminate the quotas that apply to affordable housing to solve the "shameful housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive housing reforms, including rental controls and the end of unreasonable evictions.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
“Last year I said I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that involves solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has become something too hard to achieve for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says his "primary goal" is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is thrilled with the possibility of revitalizing the Northeast club, which currently occupies third place in the League One (England’s third league division), at three points from the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B hat," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it’s something that has always made me want to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to lead a club successfully."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland's leader include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he felt no fear when he moved to such established names in such a big club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this point, success for me is measured depending on whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club certainly correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get it, but I could only think I've achieved my goal here when I can get the club back to where it should be."
Ross has only been practicing as a coach for three years, after being a time as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month period at the Hearts technical body.
Afterwards, he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made St. Mirren move from being on the descent edge to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably an authentic crossroads,” he recalled in reference to when he took over the Alloa.
“I always thought management was the best thing I could do, much more than playing.
It sounds weird, because it was good, I could make a very good living with it and enjoy some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer the stress and pressure of that work; however, in the direction I feel good.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’ve managed to do it, it’s the time of my adult life in which I’ve felt better, no doubt.”

According to a survey, the perfect time for a painting is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heatwave has boosted earnings in British pubs struggling to survive, but has concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars saw sales increases by 2.7% in July, while revenues from restaurants fell by 4.8%, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of CGA consulting firm, who was in charge of collecting the figures, commented: "The warmth of these days and the fact that England remains in the World Cup have still kept the pattern of the previous month in July, in which the pubs have slightly increased their profits by 2.8%, though they have even more restaurants.
The 1.8% drop in restaurants’ commercial activity in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mostly drinks had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, where they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly meals also suffered from heat, although not as drastically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out and drink.
In managed bars and pubs, beverage sales rose by 6.6% during the month, while meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM’s hospitality and leisure analysts, said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors when it comes to sales in the off-home business market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year will be especially painful in view of ongoing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have arrived at the worst time for gastronomic operators and the weather will tell if the most moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones that opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK’s restaurants, bars and pubs sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) have secret social media accounts behind their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
The survey, conducted on 20,000 high school students, revealed growth in fake Instagram pages
News has aggravated fears of sexual content being published
20% of students said they had a “main” account showing their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in fake Instagram accounts, a reference site for sharing photos.
The news has aggravated fears of sexual content being published.
20% of students said they had a sanitized “main” account that they showed to their parents, while they had other private ones.
A mother who accidentally met her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site saw a teenager encourage others to “violate me.”
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent colleges, found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Federation directive
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Federation Board as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most award-winning track and field athlete in Scotland and her president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want the sport to benefit from their great international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is recognized and respected in the entire athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously by counting on it in its directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I like being the spokesperson for athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help develop the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among the four golds he won and is now a regular expert at the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would determine if I would recover or how far I would do it.
It’s been exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again and I’m currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!
The announcement of the sacaleches where mothers with cows are compared divides opinion on the Internet
A shellfish company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares to mothers who breastfeed with cows they order.
To mark the launch of what is in theory the “first silent shovel in the world,” consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music showing mothers telling them the freedom that the new milk extractor gives them.
Four real women dance in a hen-filled bowl, along with a few cows, with letters like, "Yes, I order myself, but I don't have a tail" and, "If you haven't noticed, they're not drunk, they're my breasts."
The choir continues, “Order them, order them, I am feeding their babies, ordering them, ordering them, I am ordering my women.”
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has created a huge controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, many of whom say it manages to focus on the “horrors” of the dairy sector.
"It's a very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before they give birth to produce milk, with the exception that their babies are taken away days after they are given birth,” one person wrote.
The Elvie milk extractor is discretely adapted to a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: “Traumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who do stay with their babies?”
Another comment was: "Wow, there's a more dishonest advert."
However, other people defended the ad, such as a woman who admitted that the song was “disgusting.”
"I think it's a great idea.
If I still breastfeeded, I'm sure I'd have one.
Using the pump, I felt totally like a cow.
The announcement is a little allocated, but I don't give it any more turns.
It’s a product genius,” a woman told us.
Another person commented to us: “It’s a funny ad for mothers who use a breastfeeding pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), making them feel like cows.
The dairy sector is neither praised nor judged in the announcement.”
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the fasteners.
The campaign concept is based on the perception that many women who take the milk with the pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and is discreetly coupled inside the breastfeeding bra, which allows its users to move, hold their babies and even go out on the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and ECD comments: “Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallelism between expressive women and dairy cows, what we intended was to draw attention to the use of breastfeeding pumps and their challenges, while demonstrating in a entertaining and close manner the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb has appeared in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked down the hallway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrants Discreetly Displaced to Camp on Texas Border
The number of detained minors has experienced a considerable increase, although the monthly flow at the border has practically remained at regular levels, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicating the possibility of fostering these children.
Traditionally, most fathers, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that the fact of proposing to adopt a child would put their own stay in the country at risk.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential parents and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Office, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who requested to nurse unattended minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal records.
“About 80% of sponsors or their families are illegally located in the country, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to chase these people,” Albence said.
In their efforts to prosecute minors more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum period of one month from the detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the workers at the reception centres.
Many of them will testify by videoconferencing, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who do not consider themselves fit for shelter will be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers at the reception centres and the system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could result in violent kidnappings or attempted escape.
According to the advocates, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, the signs of discomfort in these children are more likely to be overlooked.
In addition, moving to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on U.S., France and Turkey 'occupation forces' to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the country’s war in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is practically over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several millions have been derailed from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said adequate conditions were given for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "seeding irrational fears" that made the refugees decide to stay out of the country.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent deal between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the deal had "clear times" and has expressed hope that military action will focus on jihadists, including the fighters of the Nusra Front (linked to al-Qaeda), who will be "eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a UN special envoy, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Mandate
According to that logic, Trump would win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators will surely expect, a destitution or scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “The most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!”
There are currently no signs of fatigue in spectators.
Since 2014, the peak audience schedules have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in peak audience hours, compared to the 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has surpassed cable channel indices with 3.5 million viewers for major night news shows.
"It's a strange attraction that we still can't understand," says Neal Baer, author-producer of Designated Survivor, an ABC drama series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride he made in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked him.
"Because it makes me laugh," was the answer Scovell received.
Chaos is always on the rise in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families could come together, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the information goes beyond the limits when you realize you’ve been watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing the use of “deep background” sources that Bob Woodward used for his book “Fear,” Trump’s <0x24>15,000 ostrich-leather hunter Paul Manafort (“a <0x24>15,000 ostrich-leather hunter”), describing the Washington Stormys’ scatomies, and the scatoms.
As for me, I will never see Super Mario again the same way.
“By offering something new every night, it’s partly what makes everything look like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, when he talks to us about the alternating distribution of the Trump show and its daily turns of the plot (whether entering a fight against the NFL or Jong Kim).
You can’t afford to miss an episode if you don’t want to stay behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27-degree day on the north coast of Kauai, but he was a refugee inside his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not get off the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judicial Commission and with the future of the Supreme Court hanging a thread.
“I remember when we were doing all those programming craziness in those days and people were telling us that that was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right.”

External money flows in mid-term elections to the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that the influx of money is arriving in Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This Pittsburgh residential district, whose structure was recently redesigned, has the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding contest for campaigns between the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, although after retreating
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to bring back the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received aid of around <0x24>140 million in 2017 for, among other things, drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings progressed, American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to avoid emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that their intention was to continue the conference, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence intends to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, as diplomats, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to deal with internal discussions under the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next planned step could be Special Advocate Robert Mueller’s report on the possible obstruction to Trump’s justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
Mueller is also believed to be investigating the possibility that Trump’s campaign would work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be accountable to that chamber, just as he is preparing to appear again to voters, and perhaps finally to a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionality, and with that I do not suggest that Trump’s fall is inevitable, nor that of its equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the contest.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to give a coup d'état against Hitler. All that was needed was that the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller’s fate?
Rosenstein has seen himself in a good place since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested recording the president in secret and had speculated about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says The Times’ explanation is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his charge in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will account for Trump?
If we fail these exams, we will find a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I don’t think we will fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s house.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from reaching his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a trampoline for bigger things.
"We got a good point, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We started the game thinking we could get something and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could have achieved the victory in the end, but overall, the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went out for all and we were the best team.
On Thursday we will have another big European night.
I hope we can achieve the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have already got a good result in the previous game, but with all the audience supporting us, I am sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now you notice a general atmosphere that everything will go well.
The team is fine, the guys are enjoying a lot and we are having a good training.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind last season and achieve success.”
Fear of retirement savings is causing some women to lose sleep
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you will not be able to prepare your family to take care of you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to receive attention, as those options can be a determining factor in the cost.
Incorporate in the conversion to your financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term care financing options can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-worthy hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover your expenses or insure yourself with your own savings, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: advance to legal battles.
Ensure that you have the power of medical care to designate a trusted person who oversees your medical care and ensures that professionals comply with their own wishes in case they are unable to communicate.
You can also prepare a notarial power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your invoices are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the small details: imagine your old father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that you are always up to date.
"It's not just the finances that are at stake: which doctors to treat?" asks Martin.
"What medicines are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned.”
Man shot several times with a carabine in Ilfracombe
They have shot a man several times with a carabine as he returned home walking after going out at night.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he received shots in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 p.m. (British time), as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
Their injuries are not fatal and the police have made a call to possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, authorities said, the number of deaths is expected to increase.
With blocked communications, assistance officials were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closest to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Central Province, which lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends over more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is a hierarchically lower administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but concentrate mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Belt of Fire, an area of great seismic activity, and often suffers earthquakes.
Below, we summarize some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the casualties occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that affected the southern coastline, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic in memory of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time it did not cause any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the deaths of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large-scale earthquakes that caused the deaths of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evacuated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, a 29-year-old citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting the arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he removed his phone.
Palin has been ordered to be imprisoned in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is detained with an unguaranteed <0x24>500 bail, KTUU reported.
He was brought to court on Saturday, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when his statement was requested, the chain reported.
Palin faces three minor Class A crimes, which means he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a <0x24>250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B minor crime, with a one-day prison sentence and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in Alaska’s veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of interfering with the denunciation of a crime of domestic violence and of possessing a gun in a state of drunkenness, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had stated that she gave him a punch in the face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her child’s violent behavior to the post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just next to the center of Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot van to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan last October, knocking down the pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injuries, according to the announcement of the intent to apply for the death penalty, filed in New York's South District.
The two charges entail a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury filed a 22-accusation to Saipov that included eight charges of murder with the help of organized crime, which federal prosecutors usually use in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," according to prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried out it as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the last time New York’s Southern District filed a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal New York case was Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that for his attack he was inspired to watch ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He has been found innocent of the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public advocates representing Saipov, said they are “obviously disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a statement of guilt with a life sentence without possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Deputy Tory Says Nigel Farage Should Take Care of Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to "feel the heat" of the Eurosceptics, while one of May's MPs suggested he should take care of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham concentration camp that the UK "would have already left" if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Prime Minister May faces to reconcile her divided ranks has been even more prominent when a group of Tories in favor of staying have joined an opposing protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep up the plan of the commitment that was signed in Chequers amid the attacks of the Brexit pro-Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that they will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the “chaos”.
MEP Bone said at the Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject Chequers’ plan.
He suggested that a position should have been given to Farage with responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have already left," he said.
Wellingborough’s MP added: “I’m going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is completely false.”
Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the concentration, where she told reporters: “I’m just saying one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote in favor and is not popular with our party and our activists, who are actually going out to the streets and voting us in the first place.
Forget Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to May, he added: “The prime ministers keep their positions when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the concentration camps that they would have to "feel the heat" of politicians if they were to be seen betraying the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them we won’t let them out with theirs.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We will mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the supporters of the stay toured the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour mitin in the city center.
Some activists wore Tories Against Brexit posters after the group’s presentation this weekend.
Worker Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party application during the opening of the conference.
“These are the same people who tell us they can deploy computer systems and all technology for Canada Plus, for the borders in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a total fake.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers all chances of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider all the possibilities of running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a municipal meeting held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, will be featured in the November re-election against Republican state representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he had planned to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time has come for “women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the top.”
LSU Sims Player Arrested for Firearm Murder
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify a man who is seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a headshot injury that eventually caused his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and received a shot from Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to having been on the scene of the crime, in possession of a gun and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98-metre-high Baton Rouge player, played in 32 games last season, being the title holder in 10 of them, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders hand him over victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas was ranked ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team’s orders would play an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton away by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter boxing and allowed Hamilton to run in the group's tail, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out with force one lap later and put himself behind Vettel, but Hamilton stepped forward after an action with the almost sticky wheels that made Ferrari driver have to leave the free interior at risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, started from the last row of the grid and placed in seventh place at the end of the first lap.
He then led much of the race while clinging to his tyres to a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered boxing in the 44th lap, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps by regaining Raikkonen fourth place.
It has been a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman by letting me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect partner,” Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not filter out Christine Blasey Ford’s letter in which she accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the nominee for the Supreme Court.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are “bad, repugnant and false.”
“The only thing that could happen and the good that is happening in the Senate these last few days is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting, and false,” he said.
"When you read the posts and the leaks, and then they say, 'But if I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember him?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
We filtered...? No, we didn’t filter it,” she added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak coming from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't filter her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and so I did.”
But his refusal did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented during the middle of Saturday night: “I will tell you one thing: that has been a really bad body language.”
Maybe he didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and repugnance, no matter who they hurt, who they have to atropel to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired Friday's defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the game back on Saturday by 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants scored an initial two-goal lead thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local kick before Dwyer restored Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen’s two goals secured his victory.
This was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to Kendall McFaull's assist, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be seen as a very lively initial period, Sullivan put the local team back in a game eager to play in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to equalize the match in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard scored the match again with a goal in the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time at the end of the second half and secured the win with his team's fifth goal as the final approaches.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape in earthquake plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died after making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large-scale earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to hit the area and many are trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
It remained firm to ensure that Batik Air’s flight 6321, which was on the track at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was crashing down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian channel ABC News reported.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts break by hearing this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many bodies under the ruins and it has not been possible to contact many people," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a massive funeral on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance with more bodies arrives.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesia’s Red Cross is trying to help the survivors as much as possible, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all tasks related to evacuation.
Are they ready?”, CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia Air Accident: Air Niugini Now Says A Man Has Disappeared After Air Accident In A Lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man has disappeared after saying the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated the plane safely and safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon a male passenger could not be noticed.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon ahead of the track.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the landing track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived very low.
“That’s an extremely good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers managed to advance through a water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that began to sink.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who performed near a dock improvement work also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Aviation security network data indicate that 111 people have died in airline crashes registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office ended the presentation of his arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to chain the movements of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, thus contradicting his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers's during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford climbed to the table on Saturday and testified that he had not been to the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "living because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile records indicated that they only met a week earlier.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be in the hands of the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims that hip hop has separated from its origins from political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Interpreters like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nurse sues a couple for firing her after a "racist" text
A New York nurse is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after wrongly receiving a text message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit with a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed consternation when she discovered that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, he was sent to Maurice twice.
After realizing her leg punching, an "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice claiming that her former African-American nanny had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipina instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice received the pay for one-day work and was sent home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal with the intention of receiving a compensation of <0x24>350 a day for the six-month internal work position for which he had been hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show you that things don’t go that way,” he told The Post on Friday, adding that “I know it’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to claims that they were racist saying that Maurice’s job termination was the most reasonable thing, since they feared they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife had sent him something I didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We’re not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have been cruel, even if it was by mistake?
To your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the lawsuit as an "extortion", Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to go for someone like that?
That’s not a very decent thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not identify with a speaking bear, reveals new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It was difficult to get in the place of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s a lot of fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
After saying that his father, who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman to inspire himself with a toy to write the children's book, trusted that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was somewhat "sweet" after his death last year.
De Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", added that her father was very proud of her final success.
"He was a very quiet man and he didn't like to presume," he said.
“But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who achieved something important: you’re proud of him, even if he’s not really deserved of you.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
On landing, his daughter was urgently transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he wasn’t expected to do it,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got Nad’s call to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be ready with you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping slowly exhausted and left his system.
She had died prematurely and everything was going off.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t learn, scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stay firm.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, strangers to the terrible experience that was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
“I shook my head and my tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Women in mourning putting cards to avoid suicide is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicides are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Ms. Davis's son, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any father to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile illuminated anywhere.”
However, he left the job before he died, as he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found him after taking his life.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly concerned that it can have repercussions."
Davis created the cards “so that people know there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk about it.”
Mrs Humphreys, who has been Davies’ friend for years, lost Mark, her partner she had been with for 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he was feeling depressed or anything like that,” he says.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his attitude changed.
Christmas day came to its lowest point: when the kids opened their gifts, he didn’t even look at them.”
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: “Leave a void in the whole family.
He's left us crushed.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on a thread at the time the FBI begins the investigation
“I thought that if we could really get something like what I was asking for (a limited time, limited scope research), maybe we could bring a little bit of unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be “going to the pin” amidst a partisan paralysis.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to be conducted?
Their rejection is entirely due to chronology.
There are only five weeks left for the midterm elections on 6 November. If, as is expected, Republicans have bad results, their attempts to achieve the election of the man they want for the country’s highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling on senators, pushing them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the bargain and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s ‘caen’ deserters figures with Kim
The number of North-South Korean deserters has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said last year there were 1,127 desertions, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high tariffs on traffickers have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on this.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriated.
Relations between North and South, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who generally agreed to work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress.
“Without the trust of the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under these circumstances, in no way will we be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, said the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a "hysterical" and that he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said it was hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh used emotion to deny allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when the two were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, at times almost screaming and clapping while talking about his family and his high school years.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned Democrats, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated defamations" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed his partiality against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements with and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi raised his objections when asked if he would challenge Kavanaugh in the event that he was confirmed in office and that Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll just say one thing: if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he won’t be able not only to be in the Supreme Court, nor will he even be in the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible sentences against the Affordable Health Care Act or the Roe Case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would annul certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and wait for us to feel that everything is fine,” Pelosi said.
And women have to push it.
It’s a justified diatribe, it’s months and years of fury overflowing, and she can’t let go without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's that weird, do I?"
“A woman who was executive at some company helped me a lot and told me that she was crying when she was angry too, but that she had developed a technique that when she was angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m.
No, I’m angry.”
And then I went on with what I was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger in part because they basically don’t understand each other well.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a man-dominated office, was once that I found myself crying with inexpressible rage. An older woman, a serious manager who had always had a slight fear of, grabbed me by the stool and dragged me down a staircase.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," he said.
“They don’t even know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they think you’ve been hooked.”
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in her presidential career.
In 1987, when Hart was captured on an extramarital adventure aboard a ship called Monkey Business for which she had to retreat from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found there was no reason not to explore the idea that she herself would run for president.
“It wasn’t a well-meaning decision,” he told me 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Somebody referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Enanits.”
As the campaign was already very advanced, it was left behind in fundraising, so it was promised that it would not return to the race unless it raised <0x24>2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave <0x24>1,000 to men, only gave her <0x24>250.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When she gave her speech to announce that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration for a system that made it harder to raise funds and focused on picking up voters instead of delegates, and rage at sexism).
“The logic would have been to think that he had had a nervous crisis,” Schroeder said, recalling the reaction of the press.
“You could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are you going to put in my pencil?
“She cried?”
Trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvages of the trade war between the United States and China were staggering, and although there is still a long way to go before the battle ends, a breakup between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by setting tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in products, charging taxes on half of the products entering the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent retaliations, recently applying tariffs of five to ten percent on US goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has committed to equating U.S. attacks, and it is unlikely that the world’s second most powerful economy will slow down soon.
Achieving Washington back would mean surrendering to demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could positively help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can cause conditions to start a sharp fall in the economy in either of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than viewers have acknowledged so far," Abigail Grace, Asia-focused associate researcher for the New American firm, said in a statement.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions were improving.
“The situation on the ground is now more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normality.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave the country due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods have already been laid.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country and in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that promoted the insurgency.
Ryder Cup to be held in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside of Paris (France).
The United States now has six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight during most of the tournament, launched his starting point to the water on hole 16 par 3, thus admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari highlighted in all of his rounds, becoming one of four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 against the lowest-ranked player of the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
World number one player Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who already has eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most tournament wins of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t avoid it.
It's been a very hard year.
I am totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy that I was able to get the cup back.
It’s a achievement for the whole team and I’m very happy to have been able to help,” said an excited García after the victory of the European team.
Now the torch passes to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday by 2 and 1 in a singles match.
"I feel an incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods as I grew up seeing this man," said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight throughout the weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m very proud of these guys, they’ve never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we're losing it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move on.
I love these 12 guys very much and I am proud to be your captain.
Now it's up to us to tilt our heads.
We have been surpassed.”
