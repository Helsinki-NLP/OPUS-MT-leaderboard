Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
Ukraine's parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Penal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the ex-president's ex-prisonment, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia that was unfavorable for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet firm, the appeal court is obliged to revise it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there were doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to remove paragraph 365 of the Penal Code condemning the former Prime Minister was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
226 votes were required for approval.
The Victory of Libya
The history of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
It remains to be determined who is the winner.
As is already customary in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it’s about diluting whether it’s moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, sharia, which we already know in some way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off from their hands.
Women can already go forgetting to emancipate and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, the society, composed of warrior tribes, will be united by the Quran.
In Libya, an order will be established that we cannot imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and it probably did not suit the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not unsurprising that the Islamic fighters accepted the help of the unfaithful dogs gratefully.
The only justification was that, from his point of view, NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but great be Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When the winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting that is used by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem expelling the "crushed"
But, without occupancy, will the oil companies be able to make themselves with Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that not, but it may be that the West can finally presume to protect human rights.
As long as the followers of sharia do not cross us.
A new era of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe go hunting for investors
A statistical turmoil has spread across Europe

In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent <0xC4><0x8C>ech and brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jira<0xC4><0x8D>ek, he won by 1-0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended fantastically against the attacks of the local team, so it will not miss the European championship date.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the match in detail in a detailed report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the defeat of the local team towards the end, as well as the excellent game of <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the heroic Jira<0xC4><0x8D>ek, won by 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrates his pass to the European Championship.
Due to the correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured in the match were Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x8D>, who left two major occasions behind.

From the first few minutes there was a good offensive game.
Both teams were just trying to keep the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kicking the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense was able to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred college students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture, they wish to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students began to pray Tuesday afternoon in front of the facility and then choreographed death slogans to the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students trained human shields around the nuclear technology center in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday.
They want to show that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
In a recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found that Iran, in all indications, is haunting itself for obtaining nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students began to pray at noon in front of Isfahan’s nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack, which aims to paralyze Iran’s nuclear program, Israeli sources say it would achieve not only the Isfahan plant, but also the facilities of Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: no embedded breakfast and dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with overweight affecting 9% of the school population and obesity at 5%.
Obese children mostly come from families with a lifestyle that is unhealthy, according to current research.
It is again demonstrated the importance of the environment where it grows for the healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as reference.
At the table, obsessed children are fed, for example, of embedded at least twice as often as children of families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had eaten fries the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program “Obesity is not a coincidence.”
In overweight families, there is no habit of sporting, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15% of children answered that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and nearly 900 basic education children from all over the Czech Republic participated in the same survey.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from 4th to 8th grade.
A proper diet and plenty of exercise in the family are decisive factors, which make the number of overweight and even obese children noticeably decrease.
“Only half of the children surveyed answered that they have five meals per day according to the diet: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,” says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast but with built-in for dinner
Experts warn that, in a healthy development, it is also important the details, which also count, such as having a fixed time for breakfast with the family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of schoolchildren’s families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one eats breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of households you don’t eat anything.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children, insanity potatoes are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet refreshments daily (70%).
Usually, more than 40% of children surveyed do sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make your diet.
The next phase of the study made it possible for the chosen chicks (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of a healthy diet, are far from ideal."
Among their favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
“It’s especially alarming the popularity of sweet refreshments,” the study’s final report warns.
The main food is the palm, the pasta, and the poultry meat is closely followed.
Practically, children always reject legumes and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changing to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
“In the control group of study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after completing the prevention program ‘Obesity is not a coincidence’, there was in many cases a significant change in favor of the principles of healthy eating,” the study’s findings pointed out.
It draws attention, for example, to the sweet refreshments, where many children would start to prefer normal and current water.
Children would also more often choose bird meat and fish for the main meal in the questionnaire and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How stylists learn, I already complained a bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences of three professionals in the field, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer an alfiler.
We’ve been studying with the director, Alena, (there’s no man in the course) about how to dress a woman who doesn’t have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is short-sleeved, someone has a stylized figure without proper curves, and someone is overweight.
The stylist should be able to optically soften a wide shoulder, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
They have given us some tricks on how to highlight the body of Jennifer López's type of women, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dressing her in a too challenging way.
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth sewing at least one extra piece of fabric tailored.
You will certainly not regret it, because the clothes you feel perfectly are unpaid.
With a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing on the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidered or flagged.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I’m happy that I have all week to put order in my head all this information.
And even so, I fear that with the assignment, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, who will have to design two dressing rooms: one for the day and one for the night.
It is necessary to take into account the current look, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
It's about "dressing" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Screaming inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained a hundred pounds (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gómez.
We have to cut the dresses out of magazines or search them online and print them out, then make them graphically.
The moodboard, which is called the full result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of the styling.
The stylist, therefore, did not only look physically, but also takes care, for example, of product pages in magazines (of specific topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
The designer and designer Mario Kameník spoke to us about all of this.
But all of this is for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three specialist guests encouraged the Saturday conference with information on all types of bodies.
Fashion designer Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be worn to the classic with jeans and t-shirt, but also serves to dress the naked body with heel shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just chop it up and climb the neck to get a completely different image.
"Play with it," he insisted.
What matters most is the following advice: “To start working, you need to know all the rules first.”
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
Finally, it is clear to me why we memorize all those formulas, what it combines with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reservation that he intends to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (then, ten outfits), you have to be ready, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And in addition to the photos the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this should be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> assured us that the image and style they alone, in many cases, represent half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marquetin have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even famous characters find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must keep in mind that they are very likely to indicate us a very different size than their actual (lesser) size.
Then only goggle and find out if the heart magazines have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has slimmed/slimmed, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that it is not enough for the stylist to focus on fashion, but that he has to understand outfit.
During your work, you should especially communicate with the people you’ve seen, so it’s essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he is not lacking, he defends his opinions.
“When a director hires you to classify the dressing room and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can’t take and throw away everything that was there and say, ‘What horror!’”
“Find at least a couple of things you can think about and recommend so that someone can put them on,” says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything should fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is fixed around the waist and has all the necessary tools there.
There are also nylon yarn (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special clamps for front clothing, if this was larger (the cuffs and other types of hooks are not allowed.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to cover the sole of the shoes.
Even during photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, it could damage the sole and much more the outside.
And we did nothing but coat and coat.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to damage them by accident.
So he had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy by praising my unreserved work.
The truth is, I don't get those skills very well.
This is just a small part of everything we’ve heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I’ve already realized that professionally styling isn’t a pink path, but it doesn’t matter what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Reveal
A trip, in principle careless, is complicated due to a series of improper carelessness of a routine trip during the morning shift.
To a certain extent it was able to meet expectations, but this is of no use, if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new release, which adds to the title, aroused great expectations already before its premiere.
He promised that he would give new air to the old racing saga Need for Speed and, as a result of what is shown, it appears as a game that should not end up being a genre of action without more.
We also feel curious about how the inserted scenes would be, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As is usually the case in NFS series, the results did not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be given as acceptable, but in total points are lost due to absurd failures, which have already appeared in the series for years.
In reality, errors cannot be called errors, but rather the incomprehensible debugging of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
It introduces you to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
You sit at the steering wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
From this it is deduced that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In this way, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even eye-catching, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to the previous deliveries of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing of the other world.
But walking through the desert, the autumn landscape or the snow-covered high mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
Instead, in the mountains you have to be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to advance to a required number of rivals (normal in a classic race), then you try to win time (chronometered classic duel) and then await a duel against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this sometimes the police appears, which does nothing but make things even more difficult.
What’s new is the scenery outside the car.
There are interactive animations when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than you would expect (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the footprints of the previous episodes.
That means that to this day it is no longer a great thing, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can already search elsewhere.
But a race designed with quite a lot of action suits this driving style quite well, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, everything's in order.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the right driving models, the same is no longer the case with collisions.
Of games like this you can’t expect to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a blow to any object, you can’t predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It’s typical that, by making a very adjusted advance or circulating the car with normal traffic, there are only slight rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing uncontrollable pirouettes.
It even ends up totally destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no major problems arise, but it can put them in a bad mood.
The resets are scheduled in such a way that, when you have an accident or leave the track, the game returns you to the last point of rescue on the track.
However, in each race there are only five resets available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it’s only a help in case something goes wrong, but it’s not very reliable.
Sometimes, even resetting helps, only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same setup, even if you're the first, fifth, or you arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you especially angry in situations, when you see that two cars going to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent moves smoothly, but when you arrive, you have to turn or brake.
It’s the same when you arrive, because it’s programmed because the “surprise” will always happen in front of your nose.
Opponents also have another advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach sites where, regardless of the moment, the same opponent will always go ahead of you in the same place.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming in front of you, so at first you can papillate the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will certainly disappoint you right away.
And it is a shame, because even though the model of the journey is simple, the game is fun and action, so it is often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn’t matter if the merit is taken the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the race ranking so that boredom doesn’t fit, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during races.
You have to pay attention to gasoline suppliers next to the road, because that’s where you have to change your car, although in the vast majority of cases you will have enough of what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight motorways and supersportive exotics for technical driving, for example, by mountain roads with curves.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know through the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also points of experience for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community features.
One of the hardest elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
By car you reach the metro tunnel (pass), where you start running in the dark on the paths (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, behind you arrives the metro convoy and takes you forward without further ado.
In the writing we will certainly have a discussion about this for several days, whether during the programming of the game no one even thought a little or whether the authors really take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even superb.
What a shame that in the most tense moments the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This especially affects accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
Audio is good and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to be pleasing to most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game for their music alone.
The final feel of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely stupid mistakes, we would have trouble affirming that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not finished.
Fun is guaranteed, but be prepared because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the strength of an airport reflector.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for negativists and Eurosceptics.
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
“I didn’t expect a war without a barracks to be waged.”
“It will take five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a bit, calms down and new players get used to their new roles,” said the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová.
How not to take seriously his slogan "clear and openly about Europe", which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many lecturers from the U.S. Carolina Faculty of Law.
Vicenová also pondered the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
“First comes the criticism, that if he is insulso, a grey official, able to take on any role, but I have to say that he left everyone confused, because he takes on his roles perfectly.”
“He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them, and has a very clear vision of where the EU should go.”
The new position of Representative for Foreign Policy and Security is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" It is therefore an important step towards unification and clarification of the political union towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban Olomouc cheese
Vicenová has also dealt with the agenda that follows, follows and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Association.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good mess", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, it is necessary to approve the seven-year EU budget, caused by the current, much more complicated economic situation.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will be prioritized, which countries will receive the most support, and which countries will receive less? That is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main themes, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe clearly".
“The truth is, I don’t like the ugly abbreviations, the alienisms or the ugliness that people don’t understand.”
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes, or that no one is going to ban us from Olomouc cheese?"
It also intends to take more advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speed awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative rather than the positive.
It also regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame is on a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, he stressed the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
“Believe me that when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes to me, a Frenchman next to me says to me, ‘What have you already left of the Visegrad Group?’”
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, awaits very tough new budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, than the new "European Federation".
“We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone.”
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
“It was said for the first time that only those countries who want to cooperate and those who don’t, that they stay out.”
"These procedures will be more and more and will strengthen Europe at both speeds," Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the EU as a whole should be debated among Member States, not only among eurozone members.
Brand story:
Innovative IBM starts its second century of existence
If someone was looking for a term that would accurately define IBM’s strategy, the most approximate would be “long-term”.
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet has been 100 years since its founding.
The foundation of this long-sleeved character was laid by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" became his stamp, around which the life of the giant's future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised corporate culture.
“For us, IBM implies long-term thinking, a continuous move toward the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained true to its basic principles, but without fear of changes around.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to thrive even more in our second century,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about caring for his employees as the entrepreneur of Ba<0xC5><0x82>a in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American operators to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated pay system that rewarded top inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication keeps IBM in the customer relationship.
From the beginning the company was able to discover talents (being one of the first companies in the world to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
On the line of the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM’s current plan, for which Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working for 30 years at IBM, where she has been the head of sales, marketing and strategy.
Over the past few years, IBM has participated in so-called virtual meetings, a rain of ideas online, from which endless future strategies and innovations emerge.
It’s no surprise that they have ideas, as almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technology enterprise,” says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of technology,” said George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world over the last hundred years.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (it develops both computers and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the highest number of patents from all U.S. technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include ATM, payment cards, financial exchanges, barcodes and disks.
IBM will charge <0x24>220 billion this year. This year it has become the second-largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations just satisfies the taste of the customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on progress, it cannot be emotionally anchored to the past,” said Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problems building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they don’t work, it abandons them).
And that’s the difference from the competition, Microsoft, which basically keeps and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the Future
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one-fifth are software and one-fifth are equipment.
However, even in 1990 the teams accounted for more than half of the suppliers' quota.
As of the year 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets for a total value of <0x24>15 billion. During the same period, it has invested <0x24>58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have been going on since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first emerged.
IBM operates according to the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
So far, IBM has managed to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM’s shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the company’s net profit has continued to increase.
IBM’s currency is to change everything except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago and is the original name of the Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted in 1924 – it was originally a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The basis for the birth of IBM comes from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
It had inventions such as the famous "slide clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired his supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the company's management.
The new leader eclipsed IBM’s founder (Watson’s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are sustained).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name implies, started with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson ran the company, the billing doubled by <0x24>9 million and began the company’s major expansion across the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after nearly forty years occupying the chief's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM personnel and computers helped NASA guide flights into space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which established the computer standard of the time, came on the market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering comprehensive consulting and high-value services.
The strategy that IBM has paid for over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, “a smarter planet.”
Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned and conditions have not improved, for example, with regard to transport and city management.
For the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smart Commerce” platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in then Czechoslovakia, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. There is also a world-renowned research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová about her infidel husband:
Iveta, stay with that ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová (45), but also her lover, Darina was still hoping that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, he will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
“Pepe can come home, but not as my partner,” Rychtárová explained.
When Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová welcomed Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová in her home during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the petition, Iveta had not moved thirty days after <0xC5><0x98>í<0xC4><0x8D>any and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship, and even said goodbye to him forever.
And Rychytá<0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife is with.
If one day Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> broke up with Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová, his wife would not expect him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children, and if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him away.”
"But here I would live no longer as my dear and old man who was wrong, but as a man to whom I have certain ties," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová said, adding that he had already detached himself from his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
So far, Joseph doesn’t care if a woman has closed the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
“My wife set this up as a marriage on paper and I respect it.”
"The company is still in force, I make arrangements from home, I take care of the garden, the home, I do shopping."
“Darina and I talked normally, the only thing is we don’t share bed,” Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> said.
If Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová found a new love, he would not oppose it.
“We don’t sleep together and she doesn’t care where she’s going or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fall in love with Iveta and I assume all responsibility,” concludes Josef.
Women’s Worst Addictions: Do They Also Refer to You?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical women’s vices, in general each of them will nominate them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where are quoted certain female vices that manage to shed the blood of men?
Go to shopping
Do you blame your average orange who is addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one car per week?
Do you like to shop often at discounts?
Then in your case it can be said that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should calm their passion for shopping, at least a little bit.
But to see, which woman could resist the temptation to walk without further ado through the clothing stores, look for well-fitted clothes and then try them all in the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can practically become a hell.
Just remember how many times you have already told your partner that you better wait for her in front of the door.
The constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I'd need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like it?"
Don't you hear these phrases?
What's that?
Then she's one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It’s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing your partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of complaints, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite tiovivo.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, rub the floor, remove the dust, rub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children who have dirty a newly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that cost him so much to clean?
In the event that you suffer from this “deviation,” try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should certainly not occupy the primary place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make unpleasant comments
"Used socks are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too."
"The wet cloth doesn't leave on the floor!"
If you do those things to your partner more times a day, know that this way you will be able to get him out of your boxes.
Of course, you don't mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Columns and jokes
Some women are also given the slanders, the jokes, but also the insults and the conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, which is why they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
At best, each of us sometimes escapes a small and harmless whisper.
With the hand in the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are chismosa women of those who are uncontrollable, who love to whisper and do it often, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female work team.
Jágr and Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped with their assistance to defeat Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr took part in the NHL match on Monday with two assists that brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina pitch and again put the Czech players at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star play, and took a step further and was declared the best player of the game.
Two attendances were awarded in the match and also Jágr's partner, Jakub Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After the meeting, Jágr said to overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"Already before the game, I had told him I would triple."
“I presented it.”
"Sometimes they seem ambushed," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the Flyers' first draw.
A while later, the team’s second intervention also had a Czech track.
Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek made himself with the disc behind the Hurricane Gate and moved it between the circles until Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second half the Flyers already dominated.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr, he scored the third goal, after his shot was beaten by Wayne Simmonds' quarter-final goal.
“I love to play with him.”
"I don't mean he's the best player on the pitch, but he's definitely among the top three," Jágr said.
“I would never have known that at the end of my career I was going to play with a sportsman like him.”
"I'm very happy with that."
“I want to play for him.”
All these years in the NHL, my colleagues played for me, and that now produces results,” added Jágr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then Dwyer's again, from a penalty, up to a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, though they ended up overturned in number two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
“He spotted the disc, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part.”
"I tried to hit the record and I'm happy that I got it," Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last goal of the game as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has been at the forefront of the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an injury to the top of the body.
The Canadians not only lost a player with a lot of defensive experience, but also by a two-goal difference, 2:3.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec did not take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and playing the game only with five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game only with a veteran player, the rest were novels.
“Finally, but it’s that nothing can be done against that, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
"So much to spin the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
“We had to simplify the game even more, get the disc out of our field.”
"And so we leave hollows," one of the defenders, P. K. Subban, explained.
Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed 30 Winnipeg interventions to the 5:2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets goals were scored by five players who ended a series of five-match defeats.
How Travel Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time sold travel only to the socialist bloc in most cases, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the DDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when one could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime inclined to the west and the travels of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., also Czechoslovakians) were not allowed to travel freely and individually, not even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies also offered trips to the West at the time, but one had to get in the queue with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have “good friends” at the agency.
Still, not everything was won.
The so-called “promise of change” that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the “politically unreliable people” who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there was a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired.
The Czech way of travel has undergone a genuine revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was the one no longer going to spend holidays in the DPRK or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
There is a great paradox, of which today we are no longer aware, the fact that to the currently favorite destination, Croatia, it was not possible to travel freely until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia then.
In the early 1990s visa exemption was imposed for travel to the neighbouring states of Western Europe, resulting in a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see themselves tired of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech groups slept in parks in tents, as our then income did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was to bring food (conserved, embedded, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was increasing and with it average wages were also rising, which caused an increase in travel demand around 1997.
With the increase in the demand for travel, agencies began to regularly prepare travel using charter flight connections from 1997 onwards, which made travel prices incredibly low compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
By the end of the 90s, the Czechs were already travelling visa-free to almost all developed countries except the US, which made our travels even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism occurred already in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct flights depart every year with Czech tourists making distant and hot countries. This winter will be flying directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries currently visit about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, symbolizing our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. removed visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, spent more than 15,000 Czech crowns per head on trips abroad, including on-site expenses.
Ordinary General Assembly convened to elect the president, who could end up dead again.
Czech football has been without a president for almost five months and it is likely that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek’s successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not be known even after the convocation of the next Extraordinary General Assembly to take place in Nymburk on Thursday.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you will not be able to vote even to choose from the three candidates.
Interested in presiding over Czech football are Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned in June not without first summoning his colleagues in order to find a strong person who knew how to handle football in the future.
However, after the end of the Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek era, a controversy arose between the two association federations unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16, when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly gathered in vain at the National House (Národní d<0xC5><0xAF>m), located in the Prague district of Smíchov, because the conversations had been blocked and not just about the method of election.
No consensus was reached either on who in the General Assembly was entitled to vote - only the legal representatives or the delegates with full powers.
From that moment onwards and because of this single point, a partial agreement was reached, supported also by the recommendation of the State and Law Institute, that representation by full powers was not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
The Executive Committee could no longer shed more light on the situation, which, at its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, had basically not resolved anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the neural point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the dead spot?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, who, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the proposed model in the statutes, in the third round will win the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his or her application.
The Region of Moravia is ready to reach a commitment so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian party, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have the majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would, however, remove the meaning of the previous two rounds and would completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian party, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With that, surprisingly, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík also agrees, although it is assumed that the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are more suitable for Pelta.
“I would like it to be voted as much as possible in accordance with the statutes.”
“So that no nonsense is invented about the representatives as in the last General Assembly,” says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who first runs as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All the passions will be settled with today's match of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will be the protagonist again, and so it would be more liked to cooperate," says the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
"I hope we can reach an agreement, but unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
“This is not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.”
“This could result in a new blockade of the General Assembly.”
"I hope that common sense will be imposed anyway," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who knows until the game starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others vice presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not depart this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which they say will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would like to incorporate the divided parties into the country’s most powerful sporting organization in order to reach an agreement.
There is much at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Federation of Sports (<0xC4><0x8C>STV) which will try to equip a new direction to the Czech sport following the financial problems of the lottery house Sazka.
Paclík will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If Pilsen’s head of football, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclik, before the Extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who satisfies all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not present himself as a candidate for such a relevant position.
“If there was a right person, I’d be fighting for her and I wouldn’t be running for the election.”
"But to this day no one has been able to find such a person," Paclík told the Czech News Agency (<0xC4><0x8C>TK).
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the election, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R).
Paclík also points out that, if he wins, he would remain president only until 2013, when the time came for the ordinary general assembly.
In that position, he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
“I’ve already talked to some people I could take into account.”
“It was crazy for me to hear some people say they don’t even want to be identified with Czech football right now.”
“I would like to change that view,” he added.
What is supposedly most annoying to Paclík right now is Pelta’s relationship with Pilsen Regional Football Association President Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"If he wins, the status will remain in place and nothing in football will change."
“With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will benefit even less,” Paclík said.
It also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta’s name was associated with a telephone hearing during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta emerged impunity.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us," said Paclík, who also takes some precaution from his previous statement that he would "sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta becomes president".
In the event of winning Thursday’s elections, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
In the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been backed by Paclík before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
“I could imagine it, for example, as the head of the representation.”
"but not as a manager of an association."
“I also don’t put my nose where I don’t feel capable,” added Paclík, who in September drew much attention to supporting the suspension of the Arbitration Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
It relies on its management capabilities of private companies, since last summer it is also the Director of Pilsen, who with his support celebrated the triumph in the first division in May.
“I have the strength to change some things in the football field and contribute to their safe practice.”
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals committee decisions, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without concealing his antipathy towards Sparta President Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>etínsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it pressured political leaders to spend more money on the sport of lottery taxes.
"It's one of the key problems that the new president should be dedicated to."
“If gambling taxes increase, as political parties announce, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to stop,” he said.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with Club Pilsner, although he himself claims that the President of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be "not a supporter".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
“But it makes no sense to hypocritically hand over my Pilsen Club shares to someone else and then return there after a year and a half,” Paclík said.
Pelta promised FA<0xC4><0x8C>R new statutes that would put an end to the deadline of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R had new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve, in the future, disputes regarding the electoral rules.
The Jablonec representative is optimistic about this Thursday’s meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could advance towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, in case of election, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate in the last minute of the general assembly, so this two-month postponement could be good for him to defend and present, in a wider context, his ideas on football management.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and hope to meet the new President this Thursday.”
“They feel it’s time for someone to manage the association,” thinks the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in Sparta and the Association’s executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly the statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
“If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president already since September,” Pelta warned.
Exactly the re-approval of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a sewing machine to win delegates.
“If I’m elected president, I’ll take it as a personal challenge and I’m willing to respond in case this fails.”
“It’s a question of principles, without which we can’t exist,” Pelta says.
Moreover, in theory, he tries not to interfere with his opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his law training, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík, who, unlike Pelta, did not let go of his head.
“It’s been more than a year in the world of football, and he’s already achieved some success.”
"His attacks were embarrassing and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the highest.
The latter should be a promotional soccer showcase.
“Also, I would try to solve all the scandals that arose due to the Bohemians as a result of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"I would immediately afterwards engage in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for the whole football," the 46-year-old said two months ago to the <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not involve any personal modifications to the team.
"I would have to know the tasks of each employee first," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, there is an understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios predicted before the upcoming general assembly, he believes delegates will not travel in vain to Nymburk on Thursday.
“If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will definitely succeed in overcoming it.
"Football needs credibility, which will only be recovered if it has a leader at last," two days before the most decisive day in its representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would begin to work eagerly.
If in the fourth General Assembly the current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that if elected, he will work hard.
It wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
It is also committed to solving the case of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, earning more money for football and continuing the work started by former President Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"As president, I would like to devote myself completely to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the team, to professional football or the training of high-performance young footballers."
“With this I don’t mean that I would do it all alone,” Rajchl said in an interview for the <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I’m a team player and I want to share the competencies of the executive committee so that each member can devote itself to a specific area.”
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of impulse."
"Many people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that he has considered the possibility of not re-presenting himself as a candidate.
"Everyone knows I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me at every step,” he explained.
“A lot of people have told me that I should not be defeated, because then others would be defeated too.”
"It's about having faith to not give up like that, no more," he said.
They say he is also motivated to continue the work he has already started with Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“During those two years, much of the work was done that I don’t want it to be lost now.”
"There are processes that had begun and that will have their effect within a couple of years and I would not like someone to have them," he said concerned that, if they elected the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could return to being the same as it was before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek's time.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
“Behind him are above all those people who would take care of football so it would be just a privilege for a few chosen people.”
“I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I’m in someone’s favor.”
"I try to be objective."
"I want to make football for everyone, because that's the only way everyone will feel good, not just the chosen," Rajchl said.
It also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
“Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind to do the best for Moravia.”
“For example, it’s time to think about the fact of dividing the second division into one Czech and another Morava, whose winners would go to the first division.”
“The current situation would not be that we have only three Moravia teams, which is a problem for young Moravia players,” Rajchl said.
Although Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the squad in the presidential election, Rajchl continues to believe in his chances of being elected.
“I still feel the strong support of the Czech Federation, which has chosen me as its vice president and knows that there are clear successes behind me,” Rajchl said, whose successes include saving tens of millions of kroner of disadvantaged contracts, negotiating the law contracts and television.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his part of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is “disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football,” he regards the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
“No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year.”
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing in committees."
“I don’t want to use that in my favor,” he assessed his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
I jump to the blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible viewpoint, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Those visiting Europe can experience their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something she couldn’t miss in her luggage, a bathtub.
Falling behind the water, he looked up at the artistic dome, swimming towards the marble angels, who awaited her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, he took note in his booklet at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
He made his "trip through the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe" through 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiasm for the bath culture.
He doesn’t want to have anything to do with sports, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers him that bathing fans have to conform with blue, chlorine-flavored tiles, while runners can breathe the fascinating smell of beetle forests or listen to the cheerful birds’ roars in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly,” says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
Swimming pool and sauna essential oils. The well-being factor in pools is so great because all senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builder tries, indoor pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of soil, in the bathrooms there is a surface of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically folded: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with small-format photographs "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and history of art in the historic oases of well-being, but, above all, it is eager to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Alongside the magnificent medical baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, there are the waters with nitrates in a unique karst cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some thermal baths, whose pools are of alkaline waters and are located in a building with a bott form of Jábec.
Many outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city looks at the roofed swimming pool of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, snow-covered, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe skiers in the practice.
The design, perhaps the most extraordinary, awaits customers in Längenfeld: The water cathedral of <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources, steam rises in winter, while at the bottom the <0xC3><0x96>tztal mountains rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the chlorine smell in all pools.
Many thermal baths smell like sulfur, in the Arpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the plague of gasoline is so strong that people believe they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose legacy sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a pleasure of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in her quest for beautiful places for bathing, when she wanted to visit outdoor pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she found herself with a blocked terrain.
The 1902 bathroom of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the shattered windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the mist growing among the tiles.
The decadence countered in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind them; not only can be discovered neo-Romanesque elements of the times of their construction in 1844, but also an Arab-style hall of the Alhambra, added in 1900.
Since its emerald modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace has been the favorite swimming pool collector’s bath, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural in the Black Forest.
“It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” says Meder.
In a palace like this, immersion in the thermal pool is apparently not very important.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes commodity business
by Christian Teevs.
Does Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural commodity business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable that banks speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions are withdrawing from the business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges raises prices, and banks are responsible for the global problem of hunger.
The consumer advocacy campaign is specifically aimed at Josef Ackermann, the head of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were thought to protect traders from price fluctuations.
The main experts agree that players have been decoupled from supply and demand, and are making profits from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than U.S. competitors: he promised to review claims and said no business "deserves to compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis must be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank directive, along with a recommendation on how to deal with the matter.
At the end of January, the management of the bank will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticisms of the financial sector: “Food price-increasing bets show in a particularly drastic way how ruthless banks are currently damaging public well-being.”
Ackermann is the largest bank manager, especially in bonds.
“Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts money at stake for food price betting,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of starving people or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it’s clear that the consortium chief wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his position.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman of the board will change something different from the unplanned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial agrarian speculation he can perfect his image.
And you just need to worry about possible losses, that's what your successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel investment in commodities
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments on which food prices would be wagered.
Many clients of the bank showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such business: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes from agrarian speculation.
43% would discourage such a bank to their acquaintances, 49% would request, after reflecting, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
The 21st house in Vienna
The moved pavilion
by Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition of Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, was left empty and collapsed.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
Modern post-war architecture is passionate, clear shapes, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, typical of thought on technical progress, so the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is a suitable example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel and glass construction.
Construction is considered to be a contemporary milestone of architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian Pavilion at the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, was erected after the universal exhibition at the Swiss Garten next to Vienna's south station, was reformed in 1962 and a museum of the 20th century opened inside, called the "House 20".
The building was suitable but lacked the appropriate spaces and technology for a museum; without any walls to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is declining more and more.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now it is called "House 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, was inaugurated, with the first exhibition, a blow of luck in some way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery since 2007, has made a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, an artistic ice skater in her youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, and stabilized the use of the monuments.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the same name foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore and an office building should be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he sensibly reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he expanded it and was awarded the contest, but not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he included "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
I knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are major problems, the building was "an energy swallower," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the windows of the glass facade was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with glass fiber was installed, and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos ceilings were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for new use, a downlight panel between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in old mahogany tones and protected from oxidation.
And the cinema is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
“I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office,” Krischanitz says and warns from a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
The flag "come from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz recently said, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and that’s why it wanted to “awaken the right consciousness.”
In this case, the house 21 is not in the wrong place, it has happened a blow of urban fortune. The all-new and planned "central station neighborhood", with homes and offices, is located next to the Swiss Garden.
And perhaps another blow of luck happens: House 21 could receive a reinforcement from another construction from Krischanitz, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as it is heard, negotiates with the city about a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that reaches millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would avoid train shortages in winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against the shortages and delays of trains caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million this year, according to a journalistic report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, of the planned investments until 2005 of a total of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million.
For this, a better availability of vehicles and the rail network must be achieved even with extreme weather.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from the tracks and slopes.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice antennas for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train shortages and delays during this winter following a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, it lacked reservations under adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been awaiting approval from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axes of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered a axis break at the central station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays millionaires in the U.S.
After the turmoil over President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem emerges, Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems weren’t enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the U.S. acquires the sector giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays <0x24>145 million (106 million euros) in an agreement, to end disputes due to the bankruptcy of five major credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
Financial market regulator NCUA criticizes many large banks for inducing credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such securities lost value during the financial crisis and drag banks into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the matter without the parties having to go to court," a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said in New York.
The bank does not admit any fault with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a <0x24>20.5 million payment.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides bankruptcy support to protect customer investments.
The NCUA attempts to reinstate the losses of millions incurred.
The agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also ordered accounts from other major banks and in summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, they are the so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble exploded in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, it is now blowing a complicated wind for American banks.
Investors and inspectors have set up countless processes to receive compensation or sanction faults.
The Federal Agency for Housing Financing (FHFA) has produced the most demands.
It blames the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately <0x24>200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a demand from the FHFA, which is business worth <0x24>14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to be responsible for "substantial losses", without specifying an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes <0x24>10 billion to IBM
The Finance Guru, Buffett, is investing heavily in IBM Information Technologies.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than <0x24>10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or information technology as the company’s long-term development forecasts are negative.
But he has read IBM’s business report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He had to understand long before IBM primarily offers services and seeks computer systems for other companies’ Information Technologies departments.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has revealed on CNBC that it has acquired shares of IBM worth <0x24>10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway of investments has thus grown to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM didn’t know anything about the commitment so far.
He commended the leadership who took care of the ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has long established profitable information technology services such as the operation of computing centers.
The old computer pioneer of over 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for businesses.
Buffett has avoided technology companies to date.
He said he was only investing in companies whose business he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the opportunity on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has approximately 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a number of major consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Municher Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, her lifestyle is humble.
That’s why it’s an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname of "Omaha Oracle".
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM’s stock in the stock market rose by one percent.
The “blue giant,” as IBM is known, has a stock value of over <0x24>220 billion and figure, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world’s most valuable tech companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn’t want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is an intimate friend.
The threat is concrete.
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper talks about a “bloodful ideology” that will resurrect.
The murders of eight small businessmen tricky and Greek between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
In Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin has reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost believed to have been dead a long time ago has returned, since the fire-shaped attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more incidents of extreme right-wing violence against Turks had occurred.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The far-right network uncovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, nor much less, predictable.
"Will bloody ideology revive again?" is the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" on the contrary points out that one of the perpetrators of the crime was a Federal Office of Defence of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the far-right pandemic.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, reminding victims of racist violence over the weekend with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn event on the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slogan: "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary", says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German broadcast "Hürriet" also does not insist on tracing this mental connection.
"It starts to smell bad," says the column title of Ahmet Külahci.
He pointed out that the assassins were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behaviour of the police and their subsequent success in the searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not searched for suspects in the far-right circle much earlier.
Some are showing less rhetorical about the drastic media: “From now on, immigrants are lost, only self-defense and armor.”
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany depends heavily on the quality of clarification and the adequacy of the sanctions to the entire network," writes Selen.
This means that if Germany’s internal peace is in jeopardy, the attacks on Mölln and Solingen will be cleared in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been engraved in German and Turkish memories.
No other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks aggravate the feeling of grouping of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press then criticised mainly the shortage of German politics following the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
Following the Solingen fire attack, he sent a telegram of remorse to the Turkish President and his Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, to replace him at the Cologne funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks in Germany contribute to the taxes.
It is clear how a person’s value is calculated based on the amount of their taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media shows again how deeply it has since been the mistrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a revaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The bank of the Lake Zurich scandal
The riskiest bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
It is now run by a German.
Axel Weber hadn’t thought about it.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank’s summit, in July it was known that in 2013 he would begin in a new and almost equally spectacular work: Chairman of the board of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is publicly pleased, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and lets down kind remarks about its future comrades.
"The USB has achieved revitalization."
"I am happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger y Oswald Grübel".
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all the bank’s security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, CEO of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go.
The chairman of the board of directors of the USB has since been considered equally touched, and everyone has asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
Weber was known to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board in May, not in early 2013, as the bank said on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and a counselor and has certainly had a period of adaptation.
In turn, he is responsible for a bank’s strategy, which has just re-tested that he deserves the title of “Europe’s biggest bank of scandal” for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is saved to the once proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis has begun.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discrete and solid Swiss asset manager, but also handsome, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with <0x24>1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s largest banks.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and subsequent banking professor in Zurich for many years, explains: “In front of my students, I have always qualified USB as a model for a good bank.”
"From the current point of view, one asks: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In mid-year, Peter Wuffli, the CEO, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To charge with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than CHF 13 billion.
For this, he found investors, of course, that some would look with contempt until shortly before: an Asian and opaque Singapore state fund and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that its name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors, in 2006 at Switzerland’s second-best-paid board, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic securities from UBS for many billions, the Helvetic Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, by which it became the co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was affected, it was said how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times higher than the economic results of Switzerland (see chart).
“We can’t rescue UBS again,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first disaster was joined by the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated into a tax conflict with America and proved willing to deliver the data of the satisfied customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of <0x24>780 billion, reimbursing unjustified profits from these businesses with a payment compensation.
With this, UBS has more or less confessed to having helped in tax fraud.
At the same time, he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich customers: the discretionary aureola.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and of the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of clients' funds.
In this way, in a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: investment banking through misguided speculation and asset management through tax fraud aid.
And just when it was back to being something quieter, just when it was thought UBS was getting it back, this unspeakable story of the operator happens, an individual operator scammed 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized something was going wrong.
And it turned out, apparently, this still doesn’t work well with risk management in investment banking.
“With the Adoboli case it turns out that risk controls have changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: “The problem with UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls.”
So the idea of precaution, with which Swiss bankers have long presented themselves, is to be the guardians of the world’s greatest assets: no too great risk, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break across the Alpine Republic.
Swiss bank security deposits were the symbol of unwavering reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich doesn’t fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it’s just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered in Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rentals are one of the tallest in Europe.
Here you can find jewelry like Tiffany`s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been residing here for years: from the national bank, through the Credit Suisse Palace, to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS via a heavy rotating door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather chairs, next to the logo of the bank there is a large sign to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the idea of the large Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank views.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both major banks.
The UBS has become too big, he says, mainly in the investment bank, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have long been accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"That Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in its nation's history," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The UBS crash" in Spanish).
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do they feel?
We talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, because of the merger, was too big for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different UBS precursor banks: a rich but sleepy bank with the Zurich property management center and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
All of a sudden, internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could run a big financial bike.
There are two names related to this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
“Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to open up step from learning in the bank to the summit.”
Finally, Ospel tied up with Wuffli.
And in the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: “He thought his models were a reality,” says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: the deacon arrived before the case.
UBS employees clearly agree on the executive meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same slogan: Down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps went well for him.
In foreign exchange transactions and in stock trading it was at its highest.
However, the advisors of the commissioned companies highlighted a weakness: In the business of international interest, in the "fixed income" banking language, there is a huge compensation for large banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Avid growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their high-risk funds created in U.S. high-risk investments.
It became a powerful machine to hold American mortgages and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks, he sought the decline for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
So much euphoria, so deep down.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order turned out to be more complicated than they expected.
Positions in the UBS have become projectible seats and are unsafe to this day.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has a job that is almost impossible.
You must find a strategy for a bank, in front of which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a banking expert, has an idea, put an end to investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But the investment bank must decline a lot, it is clear at the moment.
On Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the bank’s new president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, it was only thought of the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss as a transitional solution, as the bank surprisedly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he imposed: He must permanently direct the UBS business, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Remove 3,500 jobs.
But that's not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who's that?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is probably asking right now.
So far he only says he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock exchange
The imminent recession in Europe has frightened U.S. investors at the beginning of the week.
Changes in government in Athens and Rome remain unaffected.
Suspended industrial production on the continent suffocates the hopes of stabilizing in its origin a crisis caused by debt.
General relief could not be imposed on changes in government in Rome and Athens.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glasses were seen half full, not half empty, but now the problems are getting back to the forefront, Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott said.
First of all, financial assets are on the sales list.
The standard Dow Jones index closed with a drop of 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.
In the session, the market barometer ranges from 12,027 to 12,170 points.
The S&P 500 index closed by 1,251 points, down 1 percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock exchange index lost 0.8 percent and went out of the market by 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax index dropped by 1.2 percent to 5,985 points.
The industry of the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is at the end of its boom.
Companies produced two percent less in September than the previous month, according to Eurostat’s statistical office.
What created skepticism among U.S. investors: “We are not an island, if not dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be released so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precaution, it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, from his point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it throws on the edge a decade of old principles and enters the U.S. technology sector.
Its more than <0x24>10 billion investment in IBM supports the traditional consortium’s stock quotation and makes it quote against the market trend at first just a higher percentage.
The value closed almost unchanged at <0x24>187.35.
After some indications, Buffett paid an average of <0x24>170 for each unit and kept 5.5 percent.
The shares of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of American shareholdings were clearly strengthened by 2.6 percent of the market.
The house sells almost all of its remaining shares to China Construction Bank and is therefore accumulated <0x24>6.6 billion.
The institute primarily wants to strengthen its share of capital with the net profit of the business and thereby meet the regulatory requirements.
The Boeing aircraft manufacturer increased its profits and thereby limited losses in Dow.
The stock rose 1.5 percent, after the consortium took over the biggest charge of its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 777 type long-haul aircraft on Friday and the order value was <0x24>18 billion.
Including the options of 20 more machines, the volume amounts to <0x24>26 billion.
On the New York Stock Exchange, approximately 710 billion shares changed ownership.
719 values increased, 2281 decreased and 79 remained unchanged.
The Nasdaq closed with sales volumes of 1.38 billion, 630 shares up, 1,913 down and 82 unchanged.
Intelligent gray spreads in cities
In many places grazing is considered “problematic birds”: these intelligent animals are not expelled from cities for a long time, experts say.
Some people like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly, the fats have belonged to the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities there are complaints from neighbors about the dirt and noise of the animals.
Although no means has appeared against the "problematic birds" so far.
Grays are no longer coming out of the cities, experts say at the first grays symposium in Leer, East Frisian.
There, experts from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
Searching for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of the field of certain protected grease; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end traditional living spaces.
Hunting, growing building, and the fall of trees that host them make life difficult for birds.
Grays are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005, a controversial project to mass murder of the district's grayheads jumped on the negative headlines of the press.
Critics have described the hunting of animals by bird traps and the killing of sticks as particularly brutal.
"Expulsing them and harassing them normally, nothing is achieved," said Werner Klöver, urbanist and landscaper at Leer.
Shooting with water to nests or throwing trees are often unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert at Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals deviate, the large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Hurting them is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, senior residences or schools.
"We have to live with them, we don't catch them anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
A combination of haunting animals in sensitive residential areas and spiders is possible for them to resettle elsewhere.
"Informative panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist, advertises against it in order to treat animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can withstand a peak on the face with applause."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascheberger Grains Teaching Circuit, where posters report on the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on bird noise criticism: “All are forms of communication, they have a lot to say.”
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the grays not only take advantage of the resources to access sketches, but they manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge have checked in four degrees the extent to which bird intelligence reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a pollen larvae.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape that the stone should have to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the fatty sluts had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a pollen larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with the peak.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the tube shooter.
Three of the four grades got it in the first attempt.
Portugal in Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope in the championship.
Favorites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in the 2012 Eurocup.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the last tickets for the 2012 Eurocup in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal scored Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 one-way match, made the five Eurocup entries in a row.
The Czechs scored 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs game with outsider Montenegro, after leaving things clear in the one-way game (2-0).
Croatia did not let him score in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland scored 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals from Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances to Bosnia twice.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South Africa World Play-offs.
At the Stadium da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo ran a free direct from more than 30 meters to get to the top in the points.
A quarter-hour later, Nani showed his skills to score from a distance and scored 2-0 from 25 metres.
The Bosnians, who did not fight in the first half, had their first clear chance thanks to goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg team player, the leader of England Manchester City, sent a header to the pole, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek scored for the Czech Republic
Then, Ergolding's colleague Wolfgang Stark was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penal area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card to be thrown to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark pitched a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champion clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended their last doubt in the 81st minute with a goal of Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European Champion is ranked for the fifth time in a row for the Euro Cup.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with Bundesliga legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a second of reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided a possible goal in Tomas Sivok's own goal with a reflection (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the front-running round, very right at Cech's goal.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the world-famous goalkeeper, the frontman of FC Seoul again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the game.
In the meantime, Turkey disapproved of the wonder of Zagreb football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink should leave his 2002 World Cup third-party seat, the Croatians celebrated their fourth participation in the Eurocup final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a dream beginning.
In the minute seven and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the pole. Attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to send the ball inside the goalkeeper.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took control.
After the break, Croatia did not let him score any goals.
Together with Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute took place Ivan Perisic, from Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern from Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the Bundesliga legionaries in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Eurocopa
In Dublin, the Irish are celebrating their first participation in the Eurocup since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who triumphed 4-0 in the ida match prepared for a pre-decision, headed in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) empathized with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Los Angeles Galaxy's Robbie Keane had his first big chance.
From the first moment, the Estonian defense avoided possible goals of advantage.
But in the 32nd minute, he pushed it forward.
After a defense from goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, getting 1-0.

SAP wants to double its number of employees in China
SAP, Europe’s largest software manufacturer, invests billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double its number of employees in the country.
By 2015, it will circulate approximately <0x24>2 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5 billion), the dax consortium reported on Tuesday.
“We will get more facilities for research and development and we will hire workers,” said Bill McDermott, co-chairman, at a conference in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from 2,500 workers to 4,500.
The number of branches of the international market leader for enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Canton, Chengdu and Dalian.

Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund's intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An intimate story about the First World War, "begins with a long dramatise personae of the kind that can make one fall to his feet.
Here are some action tips: Gently start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
You will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund’s novelist narrative, and this dramatic personae will function as your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and careless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is a rare book, which rightly describes as "an anti-history work".
It contains some notable names, important treatises, or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It’s not so much a book about what happened, it explains, as “a book about how it happened.” It’s about “feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods.”
“The beauty and pain of the battle” combines the experiences in times of war of more than 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from school and botany to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, become mad or die.
Their lives blink here like voting candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mix while others are turned off.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the tragic war of trenches on the Western Front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" is expertly moved through other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book fall over the hills; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, a hurricane Katrina that clings to the cordiality.
When artillery fire is heard from a distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what’s going on, not even why you have to fight this war.
“Lack of facts,” observes Mr. Englund, “has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
"Beauty and Pain of Battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German high sea naval officer.
His stories have been obtained mostly from memoirs, letters and other previously published material.
The explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but they are more alive in the accumulation of little, lost details of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and dealing with what is there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says, "Success, everywhere Success."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about the successive food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from boiled rice and pressed in sheep fat (and finished with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of roots and dry potato peels; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, notes, "837 allowed substitutes of meat in the production of sausages, 511 coffee substitutes registered".
Some stories are about honor and value.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards wildlife and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are designed for and not to sit in chairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and to pretend that that varnish means to you and that there is no bariba civilization."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no one will know or care.
“Once you renounce the thought of sacrificing yourself, one would like to think it could happen in front of the public,” he writes.
Instead, it is horribly similar to “a convict being secretly strangled.”
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
“Conflict has become increasingly an economic competition,” writes Mr Englund, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the young century's bestiary: The eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer with good clothing that runs his carnage while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both unnoticed and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about soldiers who have actively attempted to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way of escaping the service on the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and embed their genitals with the hope of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often leads to a lifelong blindness."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s prose, agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, it reflects the way the war “has unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are fighting them.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or novels like No novels on Erich María Remarque's front, rather than integral stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it’s as if I’d come from his book, ripped that dramatis personae page from between your fingers, and burned it with a brick.
After a false step in advance, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing anti-disturbance helmets.
It was chosen from Monday night to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence highlighting how the operation faced challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, breaking department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "okupas".
And that’s why the police operation to clear the Zuccotti protester park was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The officers had prepared themselves to see how occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster simulation was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking at Zuccotti.
Agents increased the so-called riot training — counter-terrorism measures that involved quickly mobilizing a large number of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park arrived at the "last minute", someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise".
"To the few policemen I know who were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter Zuccotti Park," the person, who spoke anonymously, said.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secretism was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, some officers tried to clear the park, but resigned when hundreds of protesters emerged soon after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved agents from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who used to flood neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming out of the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
“It was appropriate to do so when there were the smallest number of people in the park,” he said.
Emergency Unit trucks with lights and loudspeakers gathered at the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The pre-engraved lights and messages that retreated from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windshields, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
No store was opened until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to pick up their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering at the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said it was attempted to prevent police from entering into action in the park, and that they had been brutally treated by agents.
Mr Browne said the mobile TV units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As police were moving westwards through the crowded personal belongings of the protesters, including bags and bags of paper and plastic garbage packed with clothes, cleaning department teams followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp's kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were candling with each other through their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency service agents were called to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearing operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were due to “alteration of public order and resistance to authority,” he said.
The highest-ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, "was not directing the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents awaited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades rose on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a series of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most noisy action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking the air out of the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of scrap came out flying out of the crowd.
In the end, an officer and a protester were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will sue the city for the dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that attend poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents’ coordinators and other employees who were among the worst-paid in the city lost their jobs on October 7, in a movement that union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, the city’s access to a health care center.
Municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a hearing in the City Hall last month, education counsel Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissals were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Board countered saying that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be fired.
Officers from District 37 said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City's Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, as well as most attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Legal Department, said the city had not seen the demand and could therefore not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of dismissals in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying the poor schools lost more attendees, as they had been insufficiently subsidized in the form of cryptocurrencies.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs at schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school attendees lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight attendees employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. District 36’s budget decreased by 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money as the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each enrollment per poor student in schools.
The union also claims that high school directors may have been deceived by the language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "excessive" to describe the action, although "excessive" more often describes the act of transferring a teacher's paycheck from a school to a work bag, whose wages are paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired,” says the draft complaint, “and not just in excess.”
Mission completed, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are finally willing to agree on something related to the Libyan uprising.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and the participation of the United States came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat for Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent for Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their "Uvalle of Successes and Rebels"
"This resolution is to honor the brave Libyans, when they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It's a bipartisan affirmation of support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the Libya debate has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were arguing with each other and with the White House about drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain filed a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a broad bipartisan margin, and it never came to vote in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory – with Congress annoying enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually sweep the grass under his feet.
Next, Congress’s indecision was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee’s resolution “congratulations to the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves” and “glory to the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary professionalism.”
The resolution also “declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure gain the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide the legislators as the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's main Republican.
The spokesman for Lugar said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican for Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a vote of the entire House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded so far in bringing their amendments to the Assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte’s is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others with slight variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment alone in the House, and another handler that will "control federal spending."
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but give their sponsors – especially new Republicans seeking to refine their curriculum – the opportunity to boast that they were the “authors” of the measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can hold, while representative José E. Serrano (New York Democrat) wants to remove the limit of two mandates for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat for Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning homosexual marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as a ban on burning flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of states.
As enthusiastic as members have been when it comes to proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly tabled more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Library of the Senate.
But they were not much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment added – the 27th – was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Goofed but not defeated," Giffords speaks in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him on fire at a constituent event in Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat for Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with Broadway’s melody “The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow” and said she would recover more from what she was going to do.
In his appearance on ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned to the House by surprise to issue his triumphant vote in the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and described his recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "Very well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long “20/20” special program, which aired the eve of the couple’s new book, “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The special program analysed the recovery of Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar crossing her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers up, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, she sees Giffords sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
A head-movement.
A whisper of the lips.
And then his first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords pronounced another word - "tostada", a request for change in his breakfast menu.
ABC videos show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he does not remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said she was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being medicated by force while waiting for trial.
"Many people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Duro, duro, duro."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point in his wife's recovery, she said, "I was defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've just been hit.
And you’re going to get out of this, and you’re going to recover and you’re going to come back stronger than ever."
Troops make you feel more sorry than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and naval infantry broke into positions around him.
The crowd of labels stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraising.
A high-ranking military officer in the gala, also known as the then president of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were shown as a kind of orphaned child,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and a often distant, sometimes worshipper American audience.
He gives the troops praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the members of the service say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they are being blamed by those uniforms.
"We are not victims at all," Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq, said in a statement.
“But it seems that the only way some people show their support is to put ourselves in the role of homeless souls.”
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops returning in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most of the talks about grief are held in silence and in private among war veterans.
After his two sons returned to battle with the Navy, retired Colonel Mark Canciano warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be a “raged and violent veteran under the surface,” said Canciano, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to endure the pressure of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions,” Canciano recalled telling his children.
The military concern arises, in part, from American indifference towards wars.
Achievements in the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praises of politicians and the public are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a service member.
Troops are recognized for the number of tours they have undergone, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military faces increasing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity to the rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next.
First soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she said she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague carrying a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked her if she could join her in her room for a drink.
“It sounded an alarm signal,” Lyman says.
However, the native of Texas left aside her concern.
I thought, no, she's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
A few minutes after entering Lyman’s room, the man approached her behind, throwing her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other members of current and former military personnel are eagerly awaiting a court decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they have filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in reducing widespread violations among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claiming that they were sexually raped or assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute or prosecute the charges.
Burke says he's going through the army's major plane, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a structure from top to bottom,” he says.
"Who are the people who are able to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have contacted her, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy—in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for the injuries suffered in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by active service personnel.
“The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs’ military service,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women’s teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It is time for the army to be modernized too, Burke says.
She’s not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are underway, in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the army that focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" assigned to victims of rape in order to give them the high of service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati's Human Service Network.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration in December, accusing her of discriminatory practices in how she handles claims of benefits for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 sexual assaults reported, according to the Department of Defense’s Office for the Prevention of Sexual Aggression and Response.
However, the aggressions are notably under-reported, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, which amounts to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the prosecution indexes: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the army were prosecuted - half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe his attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In the case of Lyman, he reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times different to a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and her aggressor's blood - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked if he had had sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as witnesses on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally absolved.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I went out, I remember telling my commanding officer, 'That wasn't your judgement, that was my judgement.'
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed her with a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was dispensed with the service under less-than-honorable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case filed by Lyman and his comrades continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What is interposed between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a constant critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it doesn’t have the same incentive and deterrence as the responsibility.
And he adds, "The odds are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try it."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t go its way, the plaintiff’s lawyer Burke will put her other hundreds of plaintiffs on the line for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform takes place,” he says.
“Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far-right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type that aired his online anti-immigration views.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from being alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time before his attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But, how to find them?
Easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We realised it wasn’t that hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published on European digital populism by the UK study center DEMOS.
Facebook’s personal information alignment is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific precision – the way vendors have been using for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe and then directed ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
Upon reaching through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 far-right matches in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
“It’s an entirely new way of doing research,” says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not at all surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry with immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.”
DEMOS’s work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health problems to social trends as expressed in “Likes”, messages on walls, and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a spike in research, boosting the number of academic jobs with the site’s name in the title to almost 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t approach with a folder on the street.
"Earlier, when you were trying to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You’d have to go through the game, and they would never allow you access,” Bartlett says.
“Facebook eliminates all that – you go to them directly.”
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues found that college students who talked about their drinking habits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student publish too many state updates with their drunkards.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Center for Children's Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly “painting” its own population for data.
The Data Team of the site has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - advocates of digital freedom must for long time to investigate other data they would put on the site.
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, like them or not - the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
“I don’t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study conducted with Facebook’s public walls of students.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know which part of a user’s profile information and wall messages are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
That’s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a tape recorder and a pen are still the best research tools no one can use.
“There’s no substitute for getting into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about social – and a lot of social is still happening offline.”
Cold and Inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Templar Knights of Norway," he said in front of a 500-person room.
“I oppose the court, since it has received the mandate from organizations supporting the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I acknowledge the facts, but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because “he didn’t want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform to express his views.”
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who gave a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Approximately 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked up under the key.
They all attended with the aim of making progress towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange notion of being part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge ruled he is not a mentally ill, and said there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
It may be comforting to some that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
“I’d like it to look like a monster, but it doesn’t look like it,” a family member of the victim said.
"It would be much easier if it seemed."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview Shown at a Theatre This Week
After Steve Jobs’ death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford – distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered interview to Jobs that has been unveiled as the advancement of a series of special projections in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the business processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a yonkie of flowcharts - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds (The Triumph of the Idiots) on the dawns of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensively on his new computer company NeXT, awaiting the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely's interview was used on Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during his transportation.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full copy was discovered on VHS in the director's garage.
This slightly re-edited archival material is the basis of Steve Jobs: The Lost 68-Minute Interview, which arrives at Landmark cinemas on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there is great silence between questions and answers – from 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient because of Cringely’s questions, pushing him to go faster toward the topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, there’s something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs assesses what other companies see as doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
One thing is to read posthumous reviews of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring in the Jobs we see here, the dreamer anxious at the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did it.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
“Over the years in business, I always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers that invariably give you are, ‘Oh, that’s just the way it’s done.’
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs details its efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
Confused by the way costs were recorded – often starting with a “standard cost” that was made in the eye of a good cube, and then adjusted with a “variable” – he developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine retail commercial costs.
About the Pope's joke:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack the phone company effectively and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been written extensively about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
It describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world half a dozen times and yelling through the public phone and coming back a minute later to the public phone at the door next door,” Jobs said with a laugh.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us, we didn’t know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing — it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak with the Pope, while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the U.S. diplomat, the two exploded in carcasses just before the Pope himself was awake to go and answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, while hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett on the phone guide and made a call to him.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and shaped my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for her.
On Improving Innovation:
At several points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Early in his career, as he devoted himself to selling a handful of base plates, a client asked him if he could assemble the whole team.
Working with only 30 days credit, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalled the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments... they yelled at me that it would take me five years [to create a mouse that would cost me <0x24>300], and I got bored and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for <0x24>15 and that was totally reliable.
About big companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple’s rebirth, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would fall into their vision, and lose control of their market share.
“You say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you do better photocopiers and printers, and what?”
You have the market share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so they are this kind of people who end up leading companies and the people in charge of the products are expelled from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position is shattered by people who do not have the notion of good vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s.
They took the defeat of the victory.
About innovation as an artistic expression:
“There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows.”
We learn a lot about the subtleties of the same.
There are sacrifices you have to make – some things you can’t make the electrons do, the glass does them, the robots do them, the factories do them.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end, everything is reduced to taste – it’s reduced to trying to expose yourself to the best that a team of humans has done, and then try to adapt those things to what you’re doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
What made the Macintosh partly great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who by chance were the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computing, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with rivals of health care law while court accepts case
On the day the Supreme Court met closed-door to discuss the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama’s health care law, two of his magistrates, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were grazed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will expose the case to the court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total health care reform approved by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists across the country.
The magistrates agreed to admit to prosecution and, in fact, a historic 5-and-a-half-hour allegation is expected by March, and the result will likely further turmoil the 2012 presidential race, which will be at its peak by the time the court’s decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and claim the law must be discarded will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated for many years to defend conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel, hours after the preliminary hearing of the court on the case.
Among the attendees was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the Health Care Act.
The special guests for dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it is not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, they would fall under the Canon Code 4C, which states: “A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest, or be included in the program of such an event.”
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
“This impressive ethics gap and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several judges that the court upholds by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
“The judges were harassed in a gala fundraising with lawyers who have cases pending in court.”
Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in critics who say they too easily mix court activity with the agenda driven by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’s wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the Obama administration's attorney general when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
His critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law as for now being impartial.
Kagan hasn't given any indication that he's going to do it.
Boeing Receives Record Order of <0x24>18 Billion
The airline Emirates requests 50 Boeing 777 dual-course aircraft, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than <0x24>1 billion.
It is rarely news when a company gets an order of 50 units of their product.
But it’s a big deal when the company is the aircraft maker Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 aircraft reaches a record <0x24>18 billion.
It is as large as the place from which Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a study released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth <0x24>450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest order in history for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 double-passenger Boeing 777 jets.
The successful order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy another 20 aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to <0x24>26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show.
On Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which presupposes fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The sale price for six of them is more than <0x24>1 billion.
“This clearly has a huge positive effect on Boeing,” Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so harmful, because the country is earning money with the rise in the price of oil.
That’s important because they’re less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, said Digora.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The UAE’s order solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the broad-frame aircraft market and helps keep track of its competitor Airbus SAS’ attempt to invade its dominion with the A350 passenger plane.
Boeing’s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it was delaying the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more impulse after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co’s shares rose 1.5% to <0x24>67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Seems Lost in Michoacán's Vote
Luisa María Calderón says the drug dealers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the contest for governor.
President Felipe Calderón’s sister appears to have lost her nomination as governor of Michoacán during the violent state election, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country,” said Luisa María Calderón in a radio interview a day after Sunday’s vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... they seized the urns, installed barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until he lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the setting up of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have slightly outperformed Calderón, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderón, a candidate of his brother’s Conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the leftist candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently serves as governor, was third, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and metanfetamines.
It is the birth state of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates left the local nominations out of fear.
Although for the PRI, no matter how unpleasant the Michoacán elections may seem, a victory will help drive the game.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: “I think this victory should be very encouraging, towards next year.”
The BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent Asian economies from growing.
Rajat Nag, director general of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the two world’s fastest-growing economies had to “do everything possible” to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe’s difficulties in a “impartial” way and said Asia’s financial assistance along with leadership and European resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all together in this."
“So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
“Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune.”
"So if China and India can help, it's by all means."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s debt costs have been dangerously triggered and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has heightened fears that it could push the global economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to join to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance – such as the purchase of EU bailout bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater negotiating power to Asian partners in Europe.
Indian Commerce Minister Anand Sharma said that “India will do everything possible” to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering the drop in exports and the exhaustion of foreign capital inputs.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an imperative, because where we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for the billion two hundred thousand people in India, of which up to 800 million live with about <0x24>2 a day or less.
“Sometimes they’ll realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beach and that won’t be good,” he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid workers of the Greek public sector in jobs of poorly managed companies, and loss generators such as railroads.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis is threatening with "significant chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing “down risks” due to Europe’s threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon warns about possible defensive cuts
Defense Secretary León Panetta warmed Congress on Monday, warning that the accompanying automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and provoke a chained financial reaction from Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan’s battlefields to civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already digesting <0x24>450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional <0x24>600 billion or more in cuts that could be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, a Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican for South Carolina.
He said Congress’s failure to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called “abduction,” would result in 23 percent global cuts and a high of many new projects.
"A cut so large, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects unable to run - three-quarters of a ship or building cannot be bought - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also be forced to involuntaryly remove many of our civil servants and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to fire civilians in order to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and would seriously damage good disposition.”
The cuts in time would reach combat troops, Panetta said.
"While the funding for wartime in the accounts of overseas contingency operations is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the war's efforts would be negatively affected by the severe disturbances in base budgets," Panetta warned.
"The hiring of staff would be reduced, which would lead to contract delays and oversight of the war-supporting contract."
"The staff in the office would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would result in a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
“This is not a result you can live with, and certainly it is not one we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and should not be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts is to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about possible cuts, even though he came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budget experience in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a shady picture of what might be ahead — an army with a shell, but not a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet-free brigade."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening words at the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers from low morality, poor preparation, and is unable to keep up with potential opponents.”
"In fact, it invites the aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlines new details of how reductions "generate important operational risks: delays in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be previously deployed and compromised around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk of operative combat infuture."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the spark, including those already being tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
The list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat boat and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping the development and further testing of the F35 could generate some <0x24>80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it’s the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines shows us how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual harassment allegations with several women; each party accuses him of lying to the other.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly hiding reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was “built” with an open microphone stating to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lie has destroyed races and devastated countries.
New York congressman and online exhibitor Anthony Weiner made the joke with his denials quickly refuted by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of funding violations related to the concealment of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one will ever forget the media circus triggered by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about the traps in school and university exams are very widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given students the exam answers in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find ourselves?
On any day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
Of course, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
Detecting lies, or “locating lies,” is an essential skill that we all need to acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclamation: “I have you”, the detection of deception is a branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the last six decades in prestigious universities that have carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that old myths about lies have been refuted.
The liars look in the eyes.
They don't always tartamude, blurry, rubbish, or worry.
It cannot also be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation, and times.
I spent several years investigating scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, or negotiation management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel comfortable, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the investigations that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more “self-oriented lies,” while women say more “other-oriented” lies—usually to protect someone’s feelings—that married people lie less often to their partners than they say “those who are not married” (those who are not married).
We also know that if you are perceived as a villain, others will feel less guilty by lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called “creating a baseline.”
Helps provide benchmarks to measure changes afterwards.
Observe the subject’s posture, laughter, and vocal characteristic.
It’s better to know if someone normally kicks his foot all the time to avoid making unfair accusations when he sees his feet kicking in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for misleading, verbal and non-verbal behavior groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as alarm signals, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body while trying to remember their story, they can point their feet toward the door, lean towards an exit, significantly change their posterity, or display a “poster-reviewed disappointment” — that exaggerated breath of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions are over.
Often interrogators falsely make it appear that the interview has ended just to seek that poster relief.
Also pay attention to the subject’s vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put his leg to the bottom and used the past while affirming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for her nationally.
People who cheat can also use a distracting language: “I didn’t have sex with that woman...Mrs. Lewinsky” or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well...to tell the truth...to the extent that I know...to my understanding."
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances of avoiding being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the pipeline diverted after the threat of U.S. delay in its approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- enraged unions, while calming ecologists -- the company looking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said on Monday night it will move the planned pipeline out of Sandhills’ ecologically sensitive area in Nebraska, and hopes the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada’s chief executive, Alex Pourbax, says the company maintains its confidence that over time the pipeline will be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the State Department announced last week that they would postpone the decision by a federal permit for the project until new potential routes are studied to avoid the areas of Nebraska’s Sandhills and the Ogallalala aquarium, a vast groundwater supply.
"This is a real way of progress," Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to detach any decision until 2013, after next year’s elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s request, and expressed his full support.
The 1,700-kilometre pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would have to cross six states.
It is hated by ecologists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on an estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and Ogallala Aquarium, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State’s current environmental impact study found that the project only had limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s inspector-general ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobby member hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign advisor in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to lead the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the disc music diva, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a madman in her Manhattan building lobby, landing her little daughter to the point that she vomited out of fear.
"Lady Marmalade's diatribe frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family said in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when tramoist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, leading to Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone approached behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said, 'Yes' and I went to pick her up,' she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman in anger.
“She said in an aggressive tone, ‘I shouldn’t have left her daughter near the door,’” Roseanna Monk said.
"I said, 'I have no interest in what you say or think.'
He got angry and began to use bad words - the word C and the word J in a loud voice...
He had a bottle of water and began to throw the water out of the bottle over me.”
He said Genevieve was hysterical.
“I told this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’ said the girl’s mother.
LaBelle shook her mother—who was still subject to Genevieve—and had to be restrained by her surroundings and removed to a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loudly that she vomited, he added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but did not get an answer.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money he gets to a supportive association for children with cancer.
“The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his behavior,” Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it comes to a kindergarten teacher who carries in her arms an 18-month-old boy.”
Climate adversity slows the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, decreased foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-described of the change, which generated great expectations with regard to the progress in the economy, but given the climate adversity at the beginning of the year, no growth is observed, instead there is a major deterioration in development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millionaire losses for the agriculture sector, limited the chances of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of overall economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic 31.16 percent drop in agriculture and other sectors that affected agriculture.
According to the report of impacts by frosts, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damages to 582 thousand 835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops were garnish, and the ovens were syrups.
The decline in economic activity has generated, up to November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of continuing state unemployment in the first three quarters of the year was observed, and a growth in the second quarter was observed, as from January to March, a growth of a thousand people, from 55,053 people to 5. the Active were unemployed, from 5.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be indirectly explained, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
"What is being seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with a number of factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a resource restriction by the legislation passed in Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who illegally grab dollars it is not easy for them to work them, to invest them."
Detained migration
Lopez Cervantes noted that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
“The number of people who go from the state looking for work overseas in the United States has been restricted, firstly because of difficulties in entering, and secondly because they already have many difficulties in finding work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise,” he said.
Informality
The labor market analysis in Sinaloa is aggravated by considering the high level of informality prevailing among working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the occupied population in the state works without being a worker before any social security institution.
Along with unemployment and informality, another of the state’s job losses are low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of the workers in Sinaloa was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, at 7,375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
Along with the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment of the last 10 years is recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June of the State IED amounted to <0x24>630,697, representing a fall of <0x24>87.3 billion in the previous period to <0x24>14.74 per cent.
For its part, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17.280 billion pesos per year, mainly from tertiary-sector companies.
The Debt
In the face of the economic contraction scenario, the state government requested in July to the state congress the approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos, the same that would be destined for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the purpose of not reactivating the economy and not benefiting the economy, the approval of the local congress was 600 million pesos per congress.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonisation of wills from the various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensively to recover the land we lost in this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, failed to align the effort of everyone and above all the good march already synchronized with this new team of government, which is expected to be much better.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said that events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of a number of events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamic that allows us to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services.
Redefine Vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he said that it is necessary to guide the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that it has been working, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic path of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated," he said.
Work to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better fit the Government's efforts.
“Generally speaking, I would say that the Government has been striving to deliver good results in various areas, there are some advances in economic development, but it is important that a long-term programme be developed,” he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of driving public policy.
“There are elements that allow us to say that the government is being more inclusive, what I can say is that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done,” he said.
He was sentenced to eight pounds of marijuana.
Five years in prison and 100 days in prison were sentenced to a neighbor from Navolato for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the convicted drug trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of ill-health, in his variant of marijuana possession for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by elements of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite post 80, in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was circulating in a pick-up truck, white, where he was carrying a black bag in the cart and a small backpack in the co-pilot’s seat, where the military found eight kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For such reasons, the insured remained at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentence continued internally at the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
He owes contributions to works
Works of a social nature included in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development stated that while the work programmes have so far advanced, they are at risk by not complying with the State Government with the corresponding contributions, which amount to more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that in total the investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent belongs to the State and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so the possible delay in the completion of these becomes in force.
“They’re almost 12 million what they’re in and even though the year is about to end, they haven’t given us a fifth, when they’ve been giving us a part since July, we’ve started the work and they’re going very far, but we need the money.”
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions corresponding to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not contribute at that time.
“It happened to us in the previous sixties because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we in order to access these programs we had to get the resources to cover what the state left behind,” he said.
Despite the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request was made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to expedite the handling so that the corresponding percentages were reached as soon as possible.
“They’re almost 12 million what they need to contribute and even though the year is about to end, they haven’t given us a fifth.”
Corte validates "analog apagón" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies between the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree advancing the so-called “analog payoff” from 2021 to 2015, failing to gather the eight necessary votes to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exaggerate his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to concretize the transition to terrestrial digital television.
As a result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and the decree remains in force.
The draft judgment, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of subordination and the hierarchy of reserve.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and by admitting the claims, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions in it for the digital transition.
The plenary also decided to reject the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the President said he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the Federal Executive could not structure through general rules the measures to prepare the public administration.
"I also do not think that if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," he recalled that planning public policy in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the state prosecutor's office.
Replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, resulting in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Delaying the change, he said, would be postponing the benefits of digitalization, which involves a public-interest decision, which has not only a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, “require the operation of the whole system established, in accordance with the principle of economic governance of the State, encompasses a group of powers which the Constitution leads to the faculty of the State Executive.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and it has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, which in some way invades the sphere of competence of Congress, since the administrative sphere is providing compliance with the laws issued by the Legislature, he said.
Analysis of the possibility of a "vote-by-vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data cast by the PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, yet the votes corresponding to 879 out of the 6,74 total records are not counted.
The possibility of counting "voting by vote" is a reality in terms of this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to data cast by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP), the difference between first and second place of the governor's election is just 27 percent, still without counting the total votes to 6,79 of the votes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), Maria de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llandar Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonise local rules with federal electoral reform.
As will be remembered, Michoacán did not approve his Political Constitution, his Electoral Code of the State or his Electoral Justice Act, every time the Congress of the State passed the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline for them to enter into force in the current state election process, and Governor Leonel Godoy argued with the Electoral Council that he had ignored the public's plans.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local Legislative Power and described the president's vote on constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal" whenever he has no right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", Maria de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llandaral stated that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be given in the assumption that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no scrutiny and computational act in the case file or does not act in the power of the president of the case; or, when there are errors or obvious alterations.
In addition, the total number of votes received in all cases of the election may be carried out when there is evidence that the difference between the alleged candidate who wins the election in question and the second-placed candidate in the vote is equal to or less than a percentage point; as long as the second-placed candidates at the beginning of the session represent the former candidate's petition.
The total number of votes may also be carried out if at the end of the ordinary calculation it is established that the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate was left in second place, in which case the candidates shall be the subject of which they shall be excluded.
It should be noted that in such a situation is the choice of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is just 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 out of the 923 total records.
His last will.
His ashes will be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of driver Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night, during Monday recognitions and a requiem mass were held.
According to his relatives, the Lieutenant Colonel's last will was that his ashes be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé.
After receiving a tribute from the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the most attached people attended the ceremony at the Martian Field.
At noon, the Lieutenant Colonel’s ashes reached the veiling chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he was given a recognition at the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former colleagues from the American college and football team, of which he was part of Felipe Bacio during his bachelor’s preparation.
"His will was to return to Saltillo and that his ashes were scattered in the sieve of Zapalinamé, he always expressed it to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the Lieutenant Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, considering that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was a successful man, extraordinary as a father, as a son, a loving brother, and on the slope of his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to join the Air College in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he was even napping in the truck; however, he always tried to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "just was in Saltillo the whole family we wanted to greet him, as the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopan for the graduation of his family, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: piloting an airplane.
They give you the last goodbye.
With honors was fired the Lieutenant Coronel de la Fuerza Aérea Mexicana, Felipe Bacio Cortés, in homage to Governor Jorge Torres López, and who surrendered to him the people and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, was both the study of Saldillo and the study of the Texicanade Air Force itself.
Bacio Cortés died in the past few days when the helicopter that was flying him, along with the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six more people, all officials of that dependency, crashed.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of Bacio Cortés (cremados) arrived, to be delivered by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by elder Jaime Martinez, in the expanse of the plant, where he was already expected by his relatives, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina.
Three abandoned bodies found in Cadereyta NL farm
Hours before the discovery, the military authorities presented to the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found killed by bullets in different parts of the body and with a gunshot wound, in an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place on the 1.5 kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed through the place noticed that in the fifth, whose beard is beige with coffee, was the open door of pair to pair.
Looking inside, about three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow beacher with a dark, shoeless mixing pants; next to him was another with a white striped beacher.
Less than a meter away was the body of another individual with a red beacher and a blue mesh pants.
The three were downstairs.
According to the data obtained at the site, the three people would have been killed elsewhere, as no shells were found on the site.
Legends from one group of organized crime to another, in addition to several bullet holes in the same and the gate, are appreciated in the bard of the fifth.
Captured 11 in Cadereyta
The National Defense Secretariat made the presentation of 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" and clandestine burials.
According to the information released, in a first event on November 11 in the Los Alveros colony were arrested eight people and managed to rescue one who remained deprived of their freedom.
They were insured with three properties and a cell phone; they claimed to be members of the criminal group called "The Zetas".
In another incident on November 12 at 06:00 hours, military personnel conducted a surveillance tour in the village of Rancho Viejo, in Cadereyta, detecting a car without plaques and with two subjects on board.
By marking them and carrying out the inspection, the military found a long gun, a loader and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on November 13 at 2:00 p.m., one of his accomplices was arrested in the La Frauda exile, who, seeing the military, tried to escape.
They are attributed to clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will take over.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “framework is now well outlined,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain struck confidence in Italy.
Highlighting pressure on Monti to rush, market instability put the performance of Italian BTP bonds 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, the leader of Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: “We said we would support this government a lot.”
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Monti’s chances of success were considerably boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, the center-right party's secretary, told the press.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the majority technocrat government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to pressure by warning that Monti’s failure would be a disaster.
Monti began its consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women’s organizations on Monday.
It will end its round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was named Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief breath at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the election advances.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should be formed only by technicians, an indication of his repairs to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The rock of the Spaniards is higher than the rocks
Of the 22 soccer players named in Spain, ten beat the 50 international games.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 contestants came to the 50 matches.
A major contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 convocated by both countries for today’s friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the San José National Stadium.
While world and European champions, number one in FIFA’s monthly rankings, account for a wide record of A-Class inter-selection games, Tricolor only owns defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
That figure reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the Stars League and in powerful Premier League clubs of England, keep an intense activity in league championships and domestic cups, and high-level shocks in European cups such as the Champions League.
The above adds to the experience with the Spanish Furia in the complicated eliminations of the Eurocup and the World Cup.
Tiki footballers, on the other hand, have a limited international rook in an area such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish team is from Archer <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who on Saturday before England (0-1 in London) equalled the record of exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and will set a new record for Spain of 127 internationals.
Xavi Hernández, brain steering wheel of Barcelona, possesses 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized by UEFA the previous week along with the other centennials of the Iberian team, the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the ariete of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Near the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
Followed by Xabi Alonso, 91; Fernando Torres, 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both 81; Andrés Iniesta, 62; Cesc Fábregas, 61; and David Silva, 53.
On the tick side, and near Michael Umana, are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the artilleryman Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with fewer than 30 attendances, Roy Miller appears at 26, Winston Parks at 26, Gabriel Badilla at 25 and Roy Myrie at 23.
The rest don't get close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa, with 50 targets, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records more than nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country on its two-decade journey celebration tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to offer one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that for them it will also make the dream of playing in the country a reality.
This was assured by the bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is on the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., alongside the angel band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, whose complete transcription is in The Nation on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I’ve been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it’s such a beautiful country and I think we’ll be able to stay a few days there.
So we're excited to bring our music there.
I wonder why there is some kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensely the previous days.
What do you tell your most ardent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the last 21 years happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, they are great places to surf; that’s how we found out, through people who love surfing.
When watching the tour, they have come delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we’ve never played there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's the reason for this?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we’ve been not playing for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they have achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
“First of all, I think none of us imagine that we would be in a big rock band and have done it for more than 20 years to make it look like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love creating music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of big bands.
We are very friendly to the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is something uncommon.
Occasionally, a band from a city emerges, but it’s much weirder when five or ten bands come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we’re lucky to be friends with all of them still and we’re honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It is also very strange that a band like yours stays united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which alone is much longer than many bands last.
Firstly, I think we are all lucky to be still alive, and secondly, we all care about the others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also opened that give each one the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you’re not too busy because it’s easy to fall into that game of big crowds and people who love your music.
While one remembers that people are there for music, that reminds you that you have to respect the music and what it brought, without behaving about being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and we never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think about the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go and work.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your job, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we’re looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Among the first things that happen to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists that I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant even though it is no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that emerged at the same time, and, if there is relevance now, I think it’s something wonderful because it’s music worth listening and bands like Mudhoney are doing better music now than ever.
At first, his music had darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is this change due to?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a bit positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them to me, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there’s some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music, and those two songs, undoubtedly, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori re-incarcerated for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his head doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who serves a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including a cancer of the tongue by which he has been operated four times and kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told television channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of the pain and loss of strength of his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he does not want it because he is known to be innocent.
It was operated on four times tongue cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kilograms, which has been accompanied by other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney calculations, arterial hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has served detention in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the Police since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squadron that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and comprised of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican partner, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be “proper for the exchange of information in all political matters between the two nations,” according to the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay’s rejection and the call for consultation with its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has presided over the G20 since November, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has in place with the South American country since January of this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has in recent years tried to speed up the concrete tax exchange agreements in order to emerge from the “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), made up of countries that have not implemented all international standards of tax cooperation.
At the trade level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigotudo fontanero passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but he had never done so far in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love of stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to stores around the world this month, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to wear glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, a specialty press officer at Nintendo in Spain, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support" as hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo’s spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, “Super Mario 3D Land” is an “accessible” video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth gameplay.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez has claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to engage less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to give a “second lap” to the game levels, which this time presents greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose between an “aggressive D” or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the various challenges and “do not succumb to optical illusions.”
This Super Mario incursion into the three dimensions also involves the character's return to a portable console, a fact that had not been produced since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo crawls to the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of previous deliveries, consisting that the bigote’s fountain will have to go through mined platforms with the aim of freeing Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colum endorses Portillo’s extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he gave prosecution to the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the <0x24>70 million laundering conspiracy.
This is how the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge him there.
In a press conference, Colum stated that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account that a court of law had already ordered extradition.
He insisted that during his mandate, he "did not put his hands on court decisions" and gave prosecution to all the extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colum's actions constitute an executive process after all judicial and constitutional instances have been exhausted to prosecute the ex-mandatory from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was absolved by the defamation of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process leading up to the extradition, but the Ministry of Public Affairs appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid falling into the marginality of untrained boys
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of century.
Added to this is the hundred-length of jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to balance an event held in the former Fabra i Coats factory, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighbourhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with dog-radiation problems or in a situation of falling into marginality.
The celebration yesterday in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the ex-consensor of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and current ecosocialist councillor Ricard Gomà attended the event.
They also attended the large hall of the Fabra i Coats the current counsellor of Social and Family Welfare, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is, but added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The president put Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight bad circumstances and for giving hope to people with difficulties.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Relocated to an occupied estate where macrofiestas were made
The invaders had taken possession of 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the estate at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare of 51 Balmes Street neighbors has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday afternoon the property they occupied illegally, and where they organized macrofiestas that despaired the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
“From now on, there will be access control,” the administrator said.
The okupas, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building – the rest are inhabited – took away all the electricity and part of the water, as well as painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially alcohol cans.
The first three floors were the scene of the crowded parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the invaders of the estate made him unfair competition, since they sold the cups for three euros, while in the discotheque they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreational premises had to respond to neighbouring noise complaints, while, she pointed out, the inconvenience is not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and, above all, the attendees of the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in the last weeks, according to the views.
The manager of the disco explained that the inconvenience was so great that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that he "forgives" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The chairman of the municipal group of the PP in the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "immediately dislodge the property to end the problems of coexistence and civicism that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the occupied building, but over the past months the octopus had gone into all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some cases even robberies have occurred.
In this sense, he added, “it is necessary to end impunity and be strong against the incivism that has been generated on the estate.”
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police arrived at 35 Mont-ral Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
A park or a mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed a few promotional passes from Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in numbers, with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park was again located, in the imaginary of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The rating of Collserola as a natural park is redundant in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jaws in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these it was until, in September, the town hall called for a mega competition consisting of 16 contests for so many other access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of park, no doubt.
Or that or someone intends to put doors into the field.
The question arises alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational and for what it implies of reflection on the city, is the subject of conversation between all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring issue to play when two members of this old caste of elected people recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this fact is based, precisely, on one of the few coincidences between the opinions of three Barcelona architects, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Módol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate on "the mountain front", whenever the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, the Green Apples, has not taken place.
"It is from the base that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, due to its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect for whom the title of "collserola doors" encloses a "lexical trap": you should not think of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where you have to act".
Módol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal of "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "certainty that it is nowadays to project public space" following the experience lived in the 80s and that he had in the area of the Forum "his song of the snail".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on which to build.
“Limiting something is fixing already the next step,” that is, your excess.
“We have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can give rise to real disasters.”
More attached to the question, Módol believes that, by simplifying, the valley slope of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", for a purely topographical question.
Módol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "must not fall into a broken sack", although he appreciates the opportunity that the town hall offers its board to intervene in this project "from the very first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter into the debate, but “doesn’t matter” whether this technical profile should lead multidisciplinary teams (“everything right,” he points out) who have had to create: “The architects should only be one tool.”
Bayona hints that the answer to the question given to this piece is complex, because at the base of the contest there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-country competitions have been called in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This causes, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the door architect next door.
In its opinion, yes, the City Council should ensure that the immediate strip above the Dalt Round should provide, in all its scope, a zone of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino Forgives Jonas Larrazábal and Will Be Free
After 72 days of incarceration, Casino Red’s legal senator granted forgiveness to the Mayor’s brother of Monterrey for the trial followed by alleged chantage.
After 72 days of detention, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released after the Red Casino's legal occupancy granted him pardon before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a trial for blackmail against the Mayor's brother.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee for the Montenegrin City Council to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
Following the public complaint, the State Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal trial against the mayor’s brother and on September 2, he was arrested and grounded for 30 days.
After four hours before the Officer of the Public Ministry 3 in Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to Casa de Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for 49 days following the dictatorship of a second order of incarceration after the Officer of the Public Prosecutor discarded the offences of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta for allegedly chanting with a million and a half pesos to the owners of the Red Casino; however, he remained only a few hours in the median security prison as there were death threats against him.
Authorities allowed him to follow the trial held in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was ordered to be arrested by the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of discoveries there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonas’ guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of my house of betting allowed the operation of the exchange.
On Monday, Casino Red’s legal occupant, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, came before the judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the mayor’s brother; so he could regain his freedom in the coming hours.
During the legal diligence, the Public Ministry agent assigned to the Judiciary, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been repaired and which of the members of the gambling house was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is granted legal pardon and thereafter no claim may be made regarding the process that followed him; in addition, he will not be required to repair damages or punishment.
After the hearing of the legal senate of the gambling house, around 15:50 the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be archived.
He will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air crash where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, and seven more people died
The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) reported that the results thrown on the crash where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others died, indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were appropriate for flying.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the ashs had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport staff.
In addition, he said that the investigations carried out in the impact area did not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
“In a search, there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements for transporting passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary assured that it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the research can last several months, it could even reach a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Major State helicopter was operating at cruise speed and that this happened on a soft ascent terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of the impact," he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the research:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical normativity the flight was performed under the visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports at the AICM located suitable conditions for takeoff, as the aircraft progressed towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico presenting low-altitude cloud layers.
Selected routes:
Due to cloud conditions, the crew is likely to have searched for a less elevated area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the last radar aircraft registration coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred in a straight and sided trajectory.
The aircraft's residue dispersion pattern allows to assume that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the scene of the accident, no evidence remains on the remains of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the research indicate that there may have been multiple contacts with the field.
During field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above average sea level, the terrain presents a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictably disarticulated along said route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area than the agreed site, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, which reinforces the presumption that the impact was presented under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Leads Social Security research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the ‘Childhood and Adolescent Obesity Genes’ protocol, which will allow for markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the 21st Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
The team is supported by specialists and graduate students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research invites the population, whether or not right-occupied, to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valle de México, where the tests are carried out to minors, every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He pointed out that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of West Mexico) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (State of East Mexico).
Once the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Sport Unit Independencia (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Sport Unit Morelos (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in children and young Mexicans to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
In celebrating World Diabetes Day on November 14, he stated that the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays all participants were applied anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure measurements, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels, and genetics (it is sought to identify genes associated with child obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research responds to concerns of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
“The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 noted that in just six years, there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and in girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic increase was also observed,” the IMSS specialist said.
He pointed out that the justification for the search for markers is that the population of the country differs from others by their genetic history.
On average, the Mexican has 65 percent Native American heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive evaluation of children, allowing them to detect whether they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said the presence of dark-colored folds (acantosis) in the neck and forearm, indicating the likelihood of metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, the doctors deliver it in writing to the parents, who are explained each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic illnesses: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying sitting in front of the TV most of the day and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high calorie intake, i.e. the highest intake of sugary drinks, of carbohydrates (tamals, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid bumps
Rafael Herrera, researcher at UNAM’s Faculty of Chemistry, develops polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent to the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 beaks each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who could be assured that even if the construction process is complete, and the construction process could be eliminated.
In its conference A Technological Opinion of the Buckets, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory in charge of the bucket develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and hence the formation of buds.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphalts, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, that together give the floor its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, near 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it has a near solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes broken, he added.
The above means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform, but is being modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineering specialist warned.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible flooring, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, consisting of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that make up the folder, he pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
By transiting the vehicles and generating effort, it allows the forces to spread very well on the floor.
If it were modified asphalt they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt, plentiful, is placed a last layer called rolling folder, which is made of a fine stone material, i.e., a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the floor that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the rolling folder also requires having the proper thickness and the material from which it is made should be taken care.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the soil is moistened, the water diffuses into the interior of the folder and it is difficult for it to come out, this causes a smoothing of all the layers of the floor and thus the formation of buds.
In the process of forming a beam, he said, the first to wear is the bearing film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but is a process that should be addressed to the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The also member of the National System of Investigators explained that vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of buckets, and therefore the thickness of each floor layer should always be in relation to vehicle load and ensure that it meets, in order to prevent buckets from forming frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to research and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already found even on the market and allow to repair buckets easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the Valley candidate miss to be the new lady Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Señorita Colombia.
The Valley receives its title of 14th Princess.
Again the Cauca Valley remains with the wishes of the crown of Señorita Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to be on the podium of winners, to look at the silver crown and the band that credit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico rose with the crown and the scepter, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina to the legion of Valecaucasian women who have been close to the crown (19), Giroza (198), Giroza (1981), Mariana (1981), Giroza (1989), Miriam Ospina Patrioit (1989), and Isarna Do (1949).
Today, the big question that many people ask is: What is missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation demonstrated that she had everything to be the new Señorita Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that got queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Señorita Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the jury’s decision to designate her as Primera Princesa is that she did not convince her with her answer to the question “What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez, de la Carreta Literaria Leamos.
When asked, the Vallecaucan answered:
“I read a lot, I believe quite a lot in literature, I think it’s a way of culturalizing myself, I definitely think the book that marked me as a child is ‘The Principle’, it’s a pretty deep book.
Currently I read "Crime and Punishment", is a universal literature book that we all should read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood."
A response that he did not like first for the term “culturalize” and second for not explaining concretely how each of the books he quoted have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina expressed feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise to pass what has to happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Prince" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses put forward, it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogota journalist insinuated that by being the preferred, the ovationed and the candidate who was carrying all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best handicraft costume, and Queen Mother), "it awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and so did not shine in the glow".
And that was noticed in her first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and her two parades on the coronation evening.
Although both looked safe, it was noted that he lacked the strength and impulse that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico did.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on RCN's "How to Home" program, said the fact that Melina was named a princess "proves that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not remain queen."
Also, Valle showed himself to the last very escaping with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For some reason, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty expressed that they were looking for a woman committed to her father’s social needs.
“Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, which before entering the Contest are already involved in projects,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the back and the fibrosis that was noted in her abdomen, but it is contradictory as it is precisely the jury that chose her as the 'Natural Beauty' candidate with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens trainer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, which was better, "but her problem of abdominal fibrosis, which the truth for me was not very noticeable, lowered her points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos considers that the mistake of the Vallecaucasian was the surgical interventions that were practiced.
“Surgery is fine, but Valle didn’t know how to do it.
His body was never his strong, and here he was charged."
For this award, which for the first time delivered the National Beauty Competition, after the parade in bathing suit came up a cruel prophecy that was fulfilled last night, since it was said that this was the contention that Raymundo gave Melina to not give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions for the designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will pass to history as one of the queens who despite her rolling passage through Cartagena, her crown was evaded.
This was the work of the calle who identified Alfonso Cano's body.
A Cali lophoscopist passed on to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a CTI lofoscopist from Cali passed on to the story as the man who confirmed the identity of the Farc's top boss: "Alfonso Cano", through the screening of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the section of the CTI, that week was the turn of “availability” to Eliasar González, a Puerto Tejada man who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to stay in the jungle for more than five days to reach the site where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms of hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliasar was warned that he should wear at least three days of clothing.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he went to the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be the man who was heading the world’s oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to carry Guillermo León Sáenz’s decadent card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it for its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian lupa, ink, transplanter and a lantern, Eliasar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those of the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Defense Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was indeed the chief of the Farc.
In Search of the Fingerprint
The recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González at the press conference for the operation against "Cano" is very significant for a fingerprinter from the Sijín de Cali.
A lot of people do not know our job.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, that can become key in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying bodies, lophoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured people.
When captured, many criminals present fake notes or have no papers.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of the wall of a house, because there the thief had supported his hand to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint from all hands and identify the criminal, who had participated in different thefts,” he recalled.
Fingerprints can also discard or reaffirm suspects in murder cases.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it puts him at the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprinter explained that in the objects "the fingerprints are removed with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,” the CTI expert said.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the CSI television program.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes a fingerprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective quotation is carried out.
The "indigned" challengers in New York City
Hundreds of protesters crawled outside Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement on Tuesday challenged New York authorities by trying to re-enter, under the auspices of a court order, Manhattan Square from which they were evicted in the morning and by trying to occupy another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters crawled outside Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order allowing the "indignated" to camp again on the spot, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to re-camp in the square, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle for returning to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sittings and demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons for the Occupy Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the response of the "indigned" to the expulsion from his camp, personally dictated by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to remain camped.
In addition, the "indigned" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and property of the Trinity Church parish.
They managed to occupy the site for at least an hour, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, while assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also sworn in.
The organization said several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders had already been displaced in support of the members of the movement and tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a private property enclosure - remains closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for this same Tuesday in which the legality of this morning's evacuation should be analyzed.
Some of the protesters displaced so far carried and distributed copies of that court order at this time and even handed them over to the guards who guarded the square, causing "small clashes," Bray said, who denounced that some officers slapped the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from expelling Occupation Wall Street members or enforcing “laws that were published after occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-accessing the park with shops or other properties they used previously.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the protesters, but warned that local laws do not allow them to reinstall with tents and sleeping bags.
The rector personally defended the morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violing the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it was becoming “a place where people were not coming to protest, but to violate laws and, in some cases, to harm other people,” as “some businesses had received threats” and neighbors were “fearing for their quality of life.”
"This morning's expulsion was awful and demonstrates that the Bloomberg fund is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers," the movement's spokesman added, accusing the mayor of "lacking respect for freedom of expression."
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they are planning to organize “great actions” for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special TV Christmas
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, it will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a rescuer in "Baywatch", a Playboy rabbit, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special on Canadian television.
CTV's private television channel announced today that Anderson, along with "crowner" Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the widespread online distribution of a home porn video in which he appears along with his then-husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a doll that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV’s special Christmas presents Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and which is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "zora" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Reborn After Earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of fall that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still convincing by the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has suffered since World War II.
The first estimates by the Tokyo Government amounted to <0x24>300 billion in material losses, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of decline, the gross domestic product data between July and September served to move page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% at an annualized rate.
Recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - is also the highest growth rate since the period of January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of the purchase of machinery to restore areas sunk by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to a 0.9% drop in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first retreat after six months of uninterrupted rises.
However, the true revolving of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of crises to strengthen – or rebuild – infrastructure, to take advantage of the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has aroused, mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refugee values" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and turbulent U.S. forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reversal for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of major tech groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blurred their weak results between July and September to the yen quote.
As markets continue to besiege the peripheral countries of the EU, the Yoshihiko Noda government does not lower its guard.
"You have to pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) indicated that most member countries presented sharper signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator anticipating the turning points in the world economy highlighted that the major powers are slowing down.
It dropped four tenths to 10.4 points, compared to 10.8 points in August.
The euro area, even, was below the average, which is at level 100, when it fell eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens is feeding the doubts again
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums fired and uncertainties re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to sink into the labyrinth leading to the outbreak of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic transitional government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of a hundred days agreed in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not back new measures for his proposed reforms and austerity.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said when opening yesterday a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the Code of Discipline for Officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear doubts about his position: “We are committed to helping the transitional government, but we are committed to nothing else.”
The conservative leader was a further step in his impulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the <0x24>8 billion Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his good visa to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still shocked by the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties sign “a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible”.
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the Troika inspectors will return "too soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth installment" of <0x24>8 billion, although there is also no definitive date.
The Greek spider still has a thread for a while.
Doña Sofía: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain’s “preponderant” place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a dominant place globally in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" he said is rooted in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on human confidence".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set out by the United Nations by 2015, and, "especially, people with a tendency to reduce the target to less."
Spain "continue working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, "garantize the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for all these women, above all the poor".
They are "many achievements achieved" and "many challenges we face".
The Microcredit Summit is set not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to drive "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is hoped that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of those homes will leave the poverty line in which they are sunk.
The impulse in the conception of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Doña Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And it is he who described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution," said His Majesty, whose link with this project was worth yesterday the qualification of the "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid.
Finally, Queen Doña Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging the participants to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said microcredits constitute "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" developed countries' governments should work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be a victim of the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded the “success” of giving “confidence” to people “excluded from all who close the doors”; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the attendees to a city that “opens its doors of spirit.”
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without major difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democratic Party.
Initially the future of Europe had not been included on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who consider that the government's policy is currently too little strict with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Management Board, was adopted virtually unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes won, with her interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summarized in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe demands peace, but also because "nine million jobs directly depend on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "it is time to open the way in Europe".
This could be reflected in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to allow the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give Europe a face".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
No doubt, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is showing hostility to him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a crushing majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank directive according to the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
Looking forward to calming the spirits within her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is also not that she has tried to win at her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The Incidence of Fraud on Disease Lows
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertook an offensive against disease reductions.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family subsidies box and give a speech on the issue, which has been recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the willingness to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on disease drops.
Firstly, to implement budget cuts: The government plans to impose a fourth day of shortage on private sector workers before they can take down.
In short, unless there is a specific business agreement, a sick worker would lose four days’ salary, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>280 million, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on officials a day of absence without remuneration in case of low employment (so far, they have no absence, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, most also put on the table the issue of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuses of low-income workers.
"Controls will increase considerably and, in addition, if someone is found committing a fraud, they will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned at RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear slightly disproportionate to the reality of low employment fraud.
In fact, since 2002, this issue has been constantly being monitored and several offensive policies have been launched, which have normally resulted.
The French don’t get sicker than in the rest of Europe.
Let us take a closer look, first of all, at the national figures.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), in 2006 more than 237 million euros were paid for low employment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economy, subsidies for lows accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion.
Of this sum, 46% corresponds to maternity and occupational accident reductions, while 54% is related to disease reductions, amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
As a result, 2.5% of healthcare expenditure.
In 2010, the French averaged 14.5 days of low employment, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a single day off due to illness.
Another study, in this case of Health Insurance, indicates that in 2010 37% of disease drops had a duration of less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them to our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to get low for disease.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that between 1994 and 2001, the global absence rate (both for health and other reasons) ranged in France from 10% to 11%, compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud at disease drops is not particularly significant compared to unreported work.
Fraud has a very limited scope.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 has led to the systematic control of disease drops of more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM verified, in 13% of the 285,000 conducted, that the short-lived drops were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of the more than 45-day drops, subject to systematic inspections, 11% of cases were deemed to be "adequately adapted or unjustified; a figure which, based on a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who have taken a disease down.
No doubt, a small figure compared, for example, to black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, such a practice would represent tax revenue losses of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 billion and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion a year, i.e. more than the total cost of low subsidies and certainly significantly more than fraud in the latter.
Papademos: Greece will need to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared to Parliament on Monday 14 November; he also added that the 100 days that have been granted to his government of union would not be enough to achieve that goal.
"In order to make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the head of government, who was delivering his first public speech during the opening debate on the confidence vote to Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the “primary task” of the new government, as “the country’s stay in the eurozone is at stake,” he added.
Accordingly, Papadémos has predicted that the country’s public deficit will drop “up to around 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, on Monday showed support for measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
He noted that he agreed with the goals of deficit and debt reduction, as well as the fight against bankruptcy, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without a written guarantee of all parties’ support for the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be sufficient and that it would not cause any external pressure.
A committee of experts says euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live denying death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In terms of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements for that.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, which featured the participation of six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Penal Code so that assisted suicide and euthanasia are allowed, when the patient is considering such an option and has been deemed competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the issue of death.”
With or without medication, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this sense is recorded in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions that do not coincide with the Federal Government's position, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not caused an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or self-suicide with non-competitive persons.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more exaggerations were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal".
“In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians Proposed for Euthanasia
Eighty-five percent of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia, as they believe it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not make it clear that the lives of the elderly or disabled have less value.
As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that a lawsuit against them should not be initiated.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, the authors of the report indicate.
In addition, among their recommendations, they suggest that the Penal Code indicates that the withdrawal of health care, if it has been legally refused, is not a criminal offence.
The committee of experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty of respecting the fact that a patient refuses assistance at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
In terms of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in health institutions in Canada, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and undergo the same procedures.
Other experts make reservations.
Other experts in the field of Health Law have already expressed their reservations in connection with the findings of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the position of the experts signing the report as "extreme", among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill people.
“This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and over 18 can ask for help to commit suicide,” said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
Now, he adds, “in society, there are labels and limitations.”
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she described as a "manifest in favor of euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly prosecuting the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan’s King Urges President Assad to Leave Power
Damascus denounces "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
The supporters of Bashar al-Assad protested in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Bashar al-Assad’s Syria was intensified, which with Russia’s support resists it and denounces that there is a “conspiracy” against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and neighboring Syria Jordan have expressed support for President Assad’s resignation.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to ask President Bashar al-Assad to “abandon power” in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime’s forces have already died.
“If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syria’s political life,” the king of Jordan, Syria’s neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu has regretted that Turkey’s mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in a failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them, they will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough position.
In response to the Arab League and European Union decisions, the United States welcomed the “strengthening of consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime’s actions.”
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" regarding the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have already lost their lives in the Deraa region of southern Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians have been killed "during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem said the country was “progressing towards the end of the crisis.”
In addition, it has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its functions, which in its view constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not flare," he added, guaranteeing that "the plots plotted against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civil protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed support for the envoy of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which, in his opinion, is confined to the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary League meeting is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to develop the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which provides for, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained demonstrators.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday said the Arab League’s decision was “incorrect” while China urged Syria to implement the plan to exit the crisis, although it did not express its support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time for markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked markets to take some time to form their team and launch a program that will include “sacrifice” aimed at regaining the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner debated yesterday with the political parties and today met with the unions and the patroness.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
“Monti has talked about a wide program with numerous sacrifices,” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the abundant small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President-elect of the Council.
The Speaker of the House, Gianfranco Fini, has said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence before Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list of a dozen Ministers to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bondmakers yesterday, asking for time.
In “democracy, there are specific deadlines” to form a government and prepare its program, he said, adding that it is “certain that markets will have patience and understand it.”
Its appointment by the President initially gained the benefit of the markets, but then the concern was imposed, in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team composed primarily of technocrats, even if he has pointed out that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government will have to function until 2013, the date of the next legislative session, it considers.
According to House Speaker Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the parliament’s confidence vote by Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he occupies the position, he will work taking into account the urgency and the aim that Italy "recover its protagonism" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: "Even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary equilibrium goal in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for new rigorous measures.
Italian “chef of chiefs” Emma Marcegaglia, who will see her mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, “because a country that does not grow can’t meet deficit requirements”.
Monti, famous for his competition and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to put some <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 billion in government bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with Iran’s nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, according to an American NGO specializing in atomic risk.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the UN agency.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its “serious concern” about a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic explosive diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
It is then believed to have cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as a member state has reported to the Agency, worked during most of his career in such technology in his country's nuclear or military program".
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by around 50% between 2009 and 2010, while in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have only decreased or slightly increased, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. it has increased by 49%, compared to an increase of 13% in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4% in crimes against Jews and a global increase of 14% in the number of anti-Army crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is troubling that these types of crimes and crimes have risen again," Human Rights First said, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long been pointing out that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hate crimes, should be considered a serious human rights violation,” added Paul Legendre, a senior official of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should endeavor to end such abuses,” he added, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in police reports on “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes its service to look a bit more like that of Facebook.
A new “activity” tab and another called “name” allow you to track more readily and live the activity of other “Twitters”, i.e. those Internet users whose messages (“tweets”) are on the Internet or who follow you.
This lets you know if they track messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they rated a favorite message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested “with a small percentage of users in August” before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its poco instintivo functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to send a message from another person, followfriday to recommend following another user) making the initiates happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of large public networks Facebook and Google<0x2B>.
On the network, users have debated the interest of this innovation by “tweets” with different opinions.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive and it looks too much like Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 wrote.
“The Activity feature is going to help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed,” <0x40>dannykronstrom writes.
Austrian
Introduction of a budgetary "gold rule" in the Constitution
The large-scale Social Democratic/Democratic coalition government in power in Austria on Tuesday decided to include in the Constitution a budgetary "gold rule" to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign ratings by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when Austria’s public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were to be reduced by a single level, from AAA to AA<0x2B>, we would have to pay an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion in interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, Deputy Democratic Foreign Officer.
Austria responds to a request from the Brussels summit to euro area member countries on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, by the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in a Legislative Decree.
The device adopted by the Austrian government approaches the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit is expected to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the federal government’s structural public deficit is expected to not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states as well as municipalities are expected to present balanced budgets.
The objective is that by 2020/2021, the public debt will be reduced under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens with new foreign exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again if the yen continued to increase.
“We will intervene, as we did last time, if we check that there is excessive volatility” in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historic peaks that resulted in the intervention of the Japanese authorities on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been gradually going up since then, driven by buyers who consider it a “value refuge” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar returned to trading on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those of the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was quoted at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This Japanese currency explosion damages the archipelago’s exports, as it hardens the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of the revenues obtained overseas by Japanese companies when they convert them into the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northeastern region of Tohoku, Noda said, fearing that the tightening of the yen would cut the roots weakly.
The world’s third economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect the "economic bases of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which on Tuesday opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "adequate measures", making it clear that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting in late October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five trillion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion), bringing to 55 trillion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion) the threshold of funds dedicated to the acquisition of various financial securities for the liquid market.
The euro area:
the types grow, the bags flake
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to harm European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weaker countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European exchanges are plunging a bit further into the negative zone on Tuesday 15 November.
At 10 p.m. in Paris, the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3,064 points.
The Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“Given the new tensions in relation to the lending yields of the eurozone countries most affected, stock markets around the world continue to yield part of their recent profits.”
“Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,” said Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a drop of 0.7%, renewing market players’ concerns about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed look at Europe and the exchanges will continue to take place at a reduced margin of variation, so investors will have no proof that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The resurgence of concerns for the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is still at its lowest level in a month and a half.
Around 10:00, the European currency was worth <0x24>1.3570, a 0.4% drop.
According to the corridors, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, which met Monday in Congress, adopted a motion that provides, in particular, for a country in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates exceed 6% with growth
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday morning, the performance of Italian bonds at 10 years was 6.85%, while Spanish bonds at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the countries of the South, although also of France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked markets to take time to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of being suffocated with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the eurozone summit on October 27 would be the “main work” of his government.
Spain is at the point of view of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The rate difference ("spread") between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new record high.
Awaiting growth figures in the euro area
From a statistical point of view, France has recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a figure more favourable than the expected 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
Insee, however, revised down the second quarter figure, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecast for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must be worth more than dogmas.
If there is an issue that you can’t deal with considering short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it’s energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting should be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will double electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing scarcity of fossil resources will have to be mitigated to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
That is not the case neither with Belgium, which subordinates its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor with Switzerland, which only aims to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, move forward with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such discourse.
The choice of Berlin will mean a sharpening of the price of electricity, a greater energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
Within a few months, the adverse effects will be noticed.
We must meditate on the case of Denmark.
Champion of Europe in the wind sector, of which it receives 30% of its electricity, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to wind intermittentness; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay for an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key driver of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in electricity prices, which would remain realistic to the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not, in principle, oppose that type of energy, according to surveys.
Let us remember that our country’s energy policy has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 executive jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets that can create non-displaceable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would involve the sacrifice of a large part of those SMEs and the loss of 6 billion euros per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would charge an EPR designed to run for sixty years, when its manufacturer is expected to collapse?
To solve the nuclear energy equation, one must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both the existing power plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of renowned professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, the Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not have any consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these advances and cooperation between the security authorities, and French and German operators and builders, the EPR has a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
As all electric players who want to build a power plant are studying it, the interruption of their construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for Areva and EDF competitors, as it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and maneuvers of Partisan dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
Nicolas Sarkozy’s immigration policy has been criticized from various points of view: saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to figure policy, compatibility of this policy with France’s self-proclaimed “country of human rights”.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped at the headlines, with the Interior Minister (see the Libération newspaper of May 23) declaring in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The question is that, on this subject, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take over all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of invading the national territory by a multitude of Polish fountains.
On both sides, immigrants are considered a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act towards immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande merely includes banalities, indicating that co-development will allow solving the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may turn out to be economically profitable, but economically comes out very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the migrants and the impact on the positives among the countries.
The restriction of immigration weakens growth and damages employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, particularly under-skilled workers, by pressuring them to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for national workers and mainly exercising professions in sectors without employment.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
Positive impact on salaries
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthesia, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of nationals to positively affect their wages and employment.
Giovanni Peri estimated that an increase of 1% in migration flows represents a long-term increase in real wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity contributed by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (less income) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to the average public budget throughout his life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to look for the growth points he was missing "with his teeth".
These teeth, which distracted immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just needs to think about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious property, but it is also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this since, although invented in Athens more than 2,000 years ago, throughout the twentieth century has suffered the tragedies of World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote and in the most direct manner possible.
We know, since Napoleon "The Little One", that this was something thought.
The universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot used to say.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its impossibility, of its inconsistency.
You have to think about this ambivalence to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer advancing in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and disorderly.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a void of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take effective blows, but a common exercise of full right, calm and continuous, of options and democracy, this time on a European scale.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where the list ends), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that clings to the orders of the markets and rating agencies, the one that suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about transferring sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty will regain the grip of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare their future through investments.
Outcome from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having long struggled against this proposal by the Socialists and by Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
Let it be so.
But to think about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new deadlock.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to “make” Republicans.
A revolution motivated by interests would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
Only by building a more democratic Europe on the political level can it be achieved, a true European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let’s make Europeans.
Cards with "contactless" chips are generalized
The world chip card show starts Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, the year 2011 is expected to end with an increase of 11% in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM phones, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart’s estimates.
The most powerful segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transportation or purchases simply by approaching the card to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share is expected to continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units are projected) and account for about 10% of the world market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been reluctant with respect to the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payments sector.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
In order to get the upper hand, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
“There are two large French establishments that have committed to systematically disseminating contactless bank cards among their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Payment by Mobile Phone
But it is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for making transactions.
"They're waking up."
“But I should finally experience a real boom next year.”
“We expect between 80 and 120 million units to be sold worldwide in 2012,” explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
Crédit agricole bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and June in Caen.
Approximately 200 customers and partners’ iPhones will be paired with a fund that allows contactless payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale has also stated yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay contactlessly via their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect, which has long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Alger "has the certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence services reports show they are cooperating," he said, without giving further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the passageways.
Kidnapped at a restaurant in Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
I'm a terrorist
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two figures have caught the attention of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is progress, but we must certainly expect to have more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it is possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such “supports” had resulted increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex and styled kamikazes or explosive devices that are used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
In fact, Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of uninteresting illuminated people.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist magnet Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin") encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict respect for Sharia, while its militants engage in the fight against the wicked central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and the attacks on the police stations multiplied.
Abuya’s reaction was, as usual, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was arrested alive, is sentenced to death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern feuds.
Last Christmas, he claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations became its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, spanning from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to “share all the information”.
The World According to Republican Candidates to the Presidency
In relation to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can it manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican candidates for the presidential election, voters might think that’s the way it is.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making increasingly strenuous foreign policy statements, traditionally a stronghold of Republicans.
The slogans, often unsubstantiated, extend over China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-located candidate in the race for the “Grand Old Party”, has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them “for manipulating their currency,” a key issue in an America exaggerated by the migration of entire fragments of their sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that involves the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama Ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost drowns in an attitude that “blows” emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who remains stuck in the depths of the surveys, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to interrupt his nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama leaves re-elected, they will have the bomb".
He also pledged to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations in relation to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-ranked candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such topics.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "trys to develop nuclear capabilities", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had a military atom since 1964.
Tehran Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military in Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current President respond that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was a fan and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naïve dialogue with Iran, the rapid departure of the Iraqi "boys" and their tergiversations in Libya, and label it weak.
Attacks are not easy.
The population is more positively judging Obama’s national security balance, which ended Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he distrusts military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that it is necessary to economically rebuild America to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
The Nord Stream, the new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned together the steering wheel of the valve that controls Russian gas input into the Western Europe network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will reach western Europe each year through a 1,224-kilometre first pipeline that connects the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline is expected to be completed by the end of 2012, which will provide a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, i.e. enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third pipe along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work presents airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic States had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding the land flow by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be harder to influence Russia by threatening to shut it down to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the Hitler-Stalin alliance to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the topic is politically delicate.
Western Europe, by supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe's energy, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
“This pipeline is a component of our association with Russia, a new artery that binds us organically,” François Fillon said during the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent the major contracts in the gas sector are as political as well as economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom’s managers, numerous at Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It is supported at the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m depth.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from World War II.
“It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, by precaution,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to take extreme measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal serpent that weighs as much as 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted throughout its length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in the waters of Sweden, but the project managers renounced it when they saw that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to be established permanently at sea off their coasts.
“In case of failure, we will interrupt the passage of gas in less than a minute,” said Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, as they have foreseen joints that, according to forecasts, will have a leak every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, drawn by a ship, carrying out external inspections, as well as by a device circulating inside the pipeline.
With the form of a pure, it is introduced into the interior of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without the need for any kind of repair.
The circulation of the gas is simply guaranteed by the pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and at the output of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to be able to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Afterwards, Gazprom rented to the company, for a renewable period of twenty-five years, all of its gas transport capacities.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually transported,” said Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline has been completed by 30% with the contribution of shareholders and by 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for the two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom assumes the risk of spending alone.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
Valves, with a height of 4.5 meters, form the gas exit door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas upon arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a branded booklet.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to return people the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine booklet is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as ageing over time.
However, Moleskine booklets with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design notebook, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The booklet is inspired by an ancient production technique, the soft skin, which refers to a varnish cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of book was highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has adapted to the present taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, to a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 books were designed, has remained a long way off.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, as the notebook attracts both businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultist.
The small Italian company, which had twelve employees at its beginnings, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the city centre, and has been able to impose his identity.
“We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the boom of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard caps, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer cases... The brand encompasses a wide range of supports.
An enviable success: in the fall of 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a well-established public policy, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among people with disabilities doubles the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the general population.
Detachable?
“No,” says Éric Blanchet, Managing Director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people.
“The progress achieved over the past 15 years is considerable.
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still a lot to do."
It should be noted that the unemployed with disabilities continue to face numerous barriers to access to employment.
They usually have a more advanced age: 37% are over 50 years old (average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not completed their bachelor’s degree and, out of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
That is, there are numerous issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the workplace and that “constitute the quid of the problem,” says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; people’s mentality is advancing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for the Cité noted that the directors surveyed had "a low level of knowledge about disabilities," with "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually disabled."
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, a goal set in a 1987 law.
According to the latest available figures, dating back to 2008, they reached a ratio of 2.6%.
“We are now reaching around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The test: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts spent, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has generated a lot of pressure for companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects true awareness, particularly among large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with between 20 and 49 employees have disabled employees in their workforce, compared with 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: "A Joy"
On the verge of facing the Bleus on Tuesday night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We will not dare to say that there was connivence between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the board of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his forward’s anger gesture against Turkey, the Belgian team has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for her progress and for her being Belgian."
"I want to move forward," replied Lille's frontman.
As for the contrast between your presentations in your team and in the selection, "it's a set", has been justified.
“In Lille, I’m all year round, which doesn’t apply to Belgium.
"I have to sit down."
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brill".
Don’t forget the “like.”
He has been encouraging the Bleus since he was seven, as well as during the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
This will certainly reinforce the “particular” character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "the Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
“We just faced it recently.
“Playing against them is always a joy.”
With simplicity, Leekens has for its part made reference to the "pride".
"I'm proud to be playing a gala game."
"Proud" also to check, as "neighbor", that France "returns to a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
“Laurent Blanc has done a great job,” he said with enthusiasm.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be happy to be able to share the plane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
“Our little Belgian people are growing,” he said.
“We’re building something; the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"You can see it in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Portugal’s Paulo Bento is facing with great optimism the return game against Bosnia (22:00), which will be held Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the game, both teams lacked realism.
“When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and above all a happy country.”
Paul Bento is now seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt; the Selecçao, which has been running since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Eurocup.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Given the one-way game (0-0), on Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given him peace of mind.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it brings a risk, as we haven’t scored out of the house.”
But at home, in the luminous Lisbon Light Stadium, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it turns out that the game "is very equal," said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect the game to be very equal, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," the 42-year-old said.
“We still have a 50% chance of participating in the Euro 2012,” said Carlos Queiroz’s successor.
Friday’s emptiness in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a hit, although they also need to score.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it poses a risk, as we haven’t scored out of the house,” Bento said.
“We’re going to play against a team that has great technical quality and that has players with great individual quality,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exercising, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "let them not time to think".
A good idea, as long as, this time, it is realistic.
