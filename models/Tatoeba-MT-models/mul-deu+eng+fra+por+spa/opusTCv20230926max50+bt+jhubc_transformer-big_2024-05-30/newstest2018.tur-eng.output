Last Minute: Our Space Visitor Giant Asteroid 2014 JO25
There are billions, perhaps more, of giant stars in the solar system that are hollow around and can lead to serious consequences when it hits.
These objects, which may have closed or open orbits from the formation of the Sun, sometimes pass through the Earth.
The 650-metre asteroid 2014 JO25 is also a visitor, and today at 14:24, the closest location to Earth will be 1.75 million km away.
Over the course of the day, we have heard more and more of this kind of news.
The main reason for this is the developments in observation techniques and observation tools.
As a result, we also have the ability to identify smaller asteroids that have not been previously identified.
In January, for example, an asteroid the size of a bus had passed only half the distance of the Earth and the Moon (<0x7E>250,000 km).
And even more interestingly, it was only a few days before the asteroid's passage.
So there might be other cosmic buses coming up to us right now.
What would you do if you knew that an asteroid 20 meters in diameter would fall in the middle of the neighborhood?
Actually, asteroids of this size won’t destroy your neighborhood, but they’ll probably blow up the glasses of all buildings.
This will also be due to shock waves that spread out from the asteroid that will inflame in the atmosphere.
For example, the asteroid that fell to Russia in 2013 was of these dimensions, and it was enough to shatter the windows of buildings in several cities.
But if you have a neighborhood targeted by an asteroid 100 meters in diameter, you should go at least 50 km away from your recommended neighborhood.
Criteria such as the size and angle of collision of the asteroid are the factors that determine the depth of the crater and the damage that the collision will cause.
Let's take a look at a few scenarios, according to the European Space Agency simulation.
If an asteroid 100 m in diameter hits Earth at a 45-degree angle 60 km per second, it will form a crater with a depth of about 250 meters and a diameter of 1,200 meters.
The magnitude of the stroke is 6 times the magnitude of an earthquake, and even if you are 10 km away from the point of impact, a 3rd degree burn will occur in your body.
The other 50 km will be waiting for broken windows.
If an asteroid hits a mile in diameter, the situation becomes even more decisive.
If such an asteroid hits Earth at the same angle and speed, it will form a crater about 600 meters deep and 12 km across.
So it turns into a large crater and disappears instantly.
Even if you are 100 km away from the point of impact due to the heat caused by the scratch, a 3rd degree burn occurs in your body.
According to the Richter scale, the magnitude of the quake is equal to the magnitude of the earthquake.
The damage that the asteroid will cause depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid, but also on the rocky structure of the region where it will collapse.
The above values are given by reference to a scenario that occurs when an asteroid like a hard rock falls into an area formed by tortuous rocks.
If the asteroid is mostly made up of iron, then it falls to a surface that is cooled by the lava, the size of the crater will increase by three times, and the disaster that occurs accordingly will collapse.
66 million years ago, something even worse happened to the dinosaurs, and they were hit by an asteroid about 10 km in diameter.
Because of the collision of asteroids, 75 percent of the sea and black lives were instantly extinct.
If this huge asteroid that is destroying dinosaurs has targeted Earth, make sure to leave the planet with the most robust option.
Every day tons of matter drops into the Earth from space.
Most of them burn in the atmosphere.
Some galaxies that are large enough to burn in the atmosphere are causing sparks known among the people as the star swings.
Let’s end with another story that will reassure our readers.
Studies show that a giant asteroid is not expected to hit Earth to a degree that will cause very serious destruction over the next 300-400 years.
As an average of 70-year-olds, I'm sure you've relaxed a little bit.
Flash claim for money: <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million!
Gary Medel, who wants to expand the stopper area, is sure to leave Inter as the name on the agenda of Black and Whites.
The 30-year-old footballer, who went on vacation after wearing the form in the Confederation Cup and started working with Inter in the past few days, awaits his upcoming offers.
From prestigious Italian newspapers, Gazzetta dello Sport suggested that Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> had made a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million offer to Inter for Medellín, both in the stoper and front-libero area.
While the Black-and-White people who offered Medel said they were waiting for a response from both sides, the Chilean footballer said he was looking forward to living with his family in Istanbul.
Despite the newspaper’s claim, it is quite difficult for Black Kartal, which is restricted by the FFP, to pay a fee of as much as <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million for Medel.
The Black-White players are likely to add the star player to the staff if they move to Medel by lease, as they were in the Caner Erkin transfer, or if they go for a severe discount in their bonserver.

Human rights group has issued travel warnings for Missouri
The National Association for the Progress of Colored People has issued a warning for colored people to travel to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement read as follows: "The State of Missouri's NAACP Travel Recommendation Statement is valid from August 28, 2017 onwards, as the last of the state-wide incidents occurring in the state of Missouri that have been suspected by African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri."
NAACP said a new Missouri law has made it difficult for people to win discriminatory cases, while the state’s legal practices are disproportionately targeting minorities, the group’s effective publication of this travel warning.
“There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They are stopped, beaten, and killed because of the color of their skins,” said Missouri NAACP chairman Rod Chapel to Kansan City Star.
"We've heard complaints about what we haven't heard before."
For the first time in the U.S., the association issued such a warning.
The group exemplified racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Earlier this year, Sanders was spotted by Missouri police without a charge after the passing of the state, and died under suspicious conditions.
A new report by the Missouri Prosecutor’s Office also points out that black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to stop than whites.
"The advisory statement is for people to be awake and to warn their families, friends, and co-workers that they may be in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People should be prepared to bring the bailout money with them, to inform their relatives of what will happen in this state."
In Missouri, according to the latest figures in the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015, which ranks the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning also responds to a new Missouri law that makes it more difficult for a workplace to file for discrimination while leasing a home or while employing.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) had issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona, after ordering the local executives of these states to detain people for immigration violations by order of immigration enforcement laws; the ACLU has increased its coverage by race.
Travel warnings are often issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently a team of defense groups within the United States has applied for this in response to laws and trends.
Demba Ba in Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>
Two seasons ago, for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>13 million, the Chinese team, which transferred to Shanghai Shenhua and rented to Black and Whites in the middle of last season, returns to Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> for free.
Black Kartal, who asked the Senegalese player for a detailed health report last week, took action following a report from the star footballer.
The Black-and-White administration, which began working for a 32-year-old player who was not considered by the representative of China in the next season, knocked on the door of the Shanghai team.
Not written in the list
Demba Ba, who was not on the list because of his status as a foreigner in China, said he wanted to return to the Black and Whites.
The Chinese team has approved the departure of the 32-year-old player.
The Senegalese footballer is expected to sign the official contract in Turkey in the coming days.
Castillo was operated on in Trabzonspor
In a statement on the website of the Bordo-mavili club, stating that Castillo underwent arthroscopic meniscus surgery of the left leg at the Istanbul Liv Hospital, "Our player, who has been performed by Prof. Dr. U<0xC4><0x9F>ur Rights, will be trained with the team in order to be provided within 4 weeks".
Castillo was injured by a right-back injury in the preparatory match in which he played with Dutch team Heerenveen at the Slovak camp.
The Colombian player, who was told to stay away from the fields for 3-4 weeks due to treatment, was also determined to have surgery due to a meniscus problem he had previously experienced.
Barzan's referendum exit!
Barzani gave a speech at a memorial ceremony in Duhok on the occasion of the 3rd anniversary of the attack on the Ezids by the terrorist organization DEA<0xC5><0x9E> in the Mosul district of Sincar.
In his speech, Barzani, referring to the independence referendum that the ICBY wants to hold on September 25, said: "I must say with regret that we have no hope that Iraq will be a right and proper country."
We tried all the ways with Iraq, but we were completely desperate and desperate.
The past experiences we have with Iraq have brought us into this situation and there is no guarantee that we can take our rights and protect them.
That is why we need to show that we can all determine our destiny to the whole world through a referendum in order to ensure life and security together.
I need to draw gold from this; the referendum is not a goal for us, but a means to reach a larger goal.
Barzani, who reminded the Kurds that the central Iraqi government had made many promises to the Kurds since the regime collapsed in 2003, said it had taken a direct referendum following the fight against the DEA.
Speaking to IKBY’s people, Barzani said, “It turns out that Iraq cannot or does not want to protect us as a state, with the Belgians, and that it wants to determine its fate in a peaceful and democratic way for self-defense and development.”
"He doesn't want us to move forward," he said.
During the fight with the terrorist organization DEA<0xC5><0x9E>, Barzani noted that the Iraqi central government did not provide them with weapons, but that in a short period of time, Hasdi Shabi, who was founded with a fetwa, was immediately legalized and responded to the provision of all weapons:
Peshmerge has not been contacted within Iraq's defense system.
The central government did not make it available to Peshmerge to Hasdi Shabi.
Peshmerge is considered by the constitution to be part of Iraq’s defense system.
However, while Hasdi Shabi did not exist in the constitution, all possibilities were compromised by breaking the laws.
We're not saying we're against Shabi.
Peshmerge and Hasdi Shabi fought on the same front, and while Hasdi Shabi was on the one hand legalized, the existence of the Peshmerge and the fight against terrorism are covered.
These are our deep wounds with Baghdad.
On August 3, 2014, the terrorist group DEA<0xC5><0x9E> attacked Ezids in the Sincar district of Mosul and killed many people, including women and children.
He returned from the accident in 10 minutes.
According to the BBC, the airline's Boeing 777 passenger plane was in the west of Japan's northern Hokkaido while North Korea's missile was in the air.
Authorities recorded that the missile landed in the area where it was located 10 minutes ago, and recorded that the missile was estimated to be approaching 100-150 kilometers to the plane.
According to Air France, the missile did not intercept the route of the aircraft and there was no problem with the flight in question.
"The information we have at this stage indicates that the missile has fallen into the sea at a distance of more than 100 kilometres," the statement said.
Nothing is sacred, is it?
Trump’s White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most definite sign of regime change is that they start attacking statues.
The Americans know as much as any of this; in fact, the cautious overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003 in Baghdad's Firdos Square...
One of the key proponents of the Trump regime, Stephen Miller, of CNN, and Jim Acosta, president of CNN, knew exactly what he was doing in a heated debate about the proposals to severely restrict legal immigration, destroying the Statue of Liberty in a symbolic way.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
If he did, the owner of a full boat tour and the Liberty imitator would lynch him.
But he attacked his monastery and especially in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed, the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to the monastery base.
Miller, speaking to Acosta, said: “I don’t want to talk about history from the beginning to the end here, but the Statue of Liberty... is the symbol of the world of American freedom.
The poem you mentioned was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
Miller's really right, but as he says, it's not really about history.
This seems to be about Lazarus’ scary words being modernized, not only in these a state invites not only some elderly immigrants, but also the fakir of the poor: "Further, poor,/Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click Free-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-Click-C-Click-Click-Click-Click-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C
There's never been a time when "The Unwanted" was so visible on our screens.
Miller did not bring a literary criticism; he explained that these people were not welcomed by Trump in the United States.
The conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is in fact a conflict about the meaning of America.
After his death, Lazarus and his friends, who were campaigning to put his words on the foundation of the statue, knew very well that they had taken quite political action.
The sculpture was intended to print the links between French and American republicanism and to celebrate Liberty in the form of a woman by representing the development of the body.
Lazarus changed his mind: in his poetry, the female figure was no longer short, it had a voice.
And she has a very different name: The Mother of the Exiled.
Marriage with the image of poetry is a feminist coup and a destructive attack against American immigrants.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wingers wanted to change it back for a long time.
Rush Limbaugh, one of Trump's Baptist John's great spokesman for the advent, argued that Freedom was an early neocon in 2010 that did not invite anyone in, but rather kept the American fire in the dark world: "Freedom stands out.
He's got the freedom to carry his mesh from the United States to the rest of the world.
It's not to light up the way to the United States."
In a very unusual way, Limbaugh had actually discovered something.
The meaning of the statue was entirely related to the angle of perception.
The wonderful creative action of Lazarus was to see it as being seen by long and mostly dreadful people, exhausted, perishing, but hopeful, on shipwrecks.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people looking for a place of refuge and wanting to improve their lives.
His statue was responding to them with words of hope and a warm welcome that they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not a perspective that Miller and Trump will in any way find right.
It is not to guide their way, but to undermine their hatred, which is their only source of power.
2017 World Championships: Neil Black commends Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers when only two Scots could join the UK team.
UK Athletics Performance Director Neil Black says the 16-member Scottish team in the World Championships team will make a "big contribution to the team."
The record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 starting on Friday.
Black believes that “something is developing in Scotland” and that UK athletics should learn from it.
Black said, "We're accepting this and we're trying to understand it and we're going to try until we get out of the business."
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it’s about what they’re doing.
Scottish athletics thinks it's about what they do.
British athletics: He thinks it has to do with what they do.
The guy in the corner, too.
Whatever the combination of the conditions, it’s definitely great.”
Laura Muir and many Scottish athletes, including Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 m, compete for the medal, while Eilidh Doyle was selected by the team as captain.
"It's a little low-volunteered.
The captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
“Whether they are Scottish or wherever they live or practice, a few athletes are very proud of that room and really motivated.
The passion and true feeling that Eilidh naturally embraced was wonderful."
The silver medalist from the United Nations, who will compete in the 400 metres behind the fifth World Championships, says it's "unimaginable" that 16 Scots are in the UK team.
Scotland's previous world championships had the best total number of athletes, seven successful in 1983 and 2015.
Last year, he was the leader of the midfielder Muir, who broke five UK and two European records.
It will join 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another Scottish to be followed by Chris O'Hare, who spent a very good season, including tryouts of the British Team and wins at the Annual Games.
Doyle remembers Lee McConnell, the first Scottish champion on the team.
The team captain says he is "very proud" of the move that many of his fans are not just going to join the team but in some cases he will compete for the medal and give the finals a fight.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that it was with the votes given by other team members, so it was already a huge honor, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you made it extra special for me."
"Honestly, I'm proud of all the Scots who are in the team.
This shows how far we have gone.
And they're here, as self-proven athletes, as athletes who want to get out of the podium.
When it comes to Captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we are very fortunate in this situation, in the sense that there is a World Championship in our home.
I mean, it's actually just the effect of being able to benefit from this inner field support and the fact that we've returned to the Olympic Stadium.
I'm taking a second chance to go there and fight, and there's going to be such a great atmosphere."
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Be Candidate for State Duty If You Can't Remove Voter Criticism
The father of our country had a lot of information about taking a negative role in the press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for newspapers to start criticizing him severely about everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course, he was upset by the criticism.
But the critics did not silence him.
In 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be abolished, and we can be pushed to the shore in a stupid and silent manner.”
This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needs more work to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted the sharing of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor’s staff didn’t care because the case was serious, and online reviews were filled with “who cares?” responses.
Many people say, “It’s just Facebook.”
But that's important.
This is especially important when you have someone like Hogan.
It is a Republican governor who is incredibly popular in a state that is mostly Democrat.
It has the second highest representation among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan's not a crazy backwards.
He was able to lead his state and demonstrate a strong commitment to the principles.
By presenting his hairless head after chemotherapy in a joke, he was also quite skilled at using Facebook as the primary tool to connect with his voters.
So blocking people from coming to the governor’s page, which is an open forum for the public, officially classified and paid tax dollars of the public, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's female spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions by claiming that blocking comments is nothing more than regulating them.
But the images of trolls or spammers or hateful people’s online verbal attacks are very easy to use.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, a job owner, and a priest; not a troll.
He said all his comments were not respectful, thoughtful, and dishonest.
The priest, in his sharing, quoted Hogan's Catholic faith.
Maryland Bowie's lawyer, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, was not full of hate but asked questions about hate crimes.
"I am kindly disappointed that I have been disappointed with his hate crimes and other recent news unanswered," he wrote in the Post's comment section.
“I also don’t like the idea that when many people comment on the same subject, some people immediately ignore the idea that a large group of concerned citizens are being ignored as a collective effort.”
Others that the governor’s staff has called a “concentrated spam attack” will likely call it a “thinking defense.”
The Facebook era makes it easier to adapt a message easily by blocking an opponent or deleting a negative message.
The staff outside are much cleaner than the old days when they were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or when protesters had to be arrested and silenced.
But even if it’s digital, that’s exactly what happens.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for deactivating Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter.
One of the decisions that could be a reference to this issue came from Virginia last week.
Loudoun’s Administrative District Board of Inspectors chairman James C. Cacheris, a U.S. District Judge in Alexandria, said in a statement that a voter was banned on Facebook as opposed to the First Constitutional Amendment.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (Republican) was also visited by ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the affordable mail era had a pretty similar effect on our internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the unnamed writers abused his leadership.
Even then, Washington had unknown trolls.
All the people who used nicknames such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to the newspapers that undertook Washington's decisions.
According to the George Washington Online Articles Project, which collects historical documents, the office of petitioners criticizing its position on the Friendship, Trade, and Securities Agreement with Britain was undermined.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, opposition and tolerance is at the heart of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting that, too.
Ronan Rafferty hopes his home will be comfortable at the Renaissance Club
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty hopes that in the next three days, the Renaissance Club in South Lothian will be home to the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, leading the next door to the final before losing to Paul Eales at Archerfield Links, feels committed to the new venue and acts as an ambassador to the tournament on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
Rafferty said, "I watched the construction of the Renaissance Club and we see it coming to show with this organization."
Players will see the field in the best possible way, in a state of discomfort.
Jerry did a job of building this place.
He is an unprecedented defender of this game and is proud of its success here.
It’s a great show for this field.”
Despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour, Eales will fight to defend a championship for the first time in his 32-year career.
Southport-based actor said, "It really feels special."
“I didn’t have a chance to defend the Extremadura Open because the next year I won was removed from my calendar.
It's nice to go back to this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
Memories from last year are reviving and it was very special to win for my wife Sharon last year.
It was a very special time and we will always be born with love.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour at the age of 50 earlier this year, is returning to his own field.
It will be the first Scottish exhibition since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
Helensburgh man Orr said, "When you fight inside, it always means a little more."
“You want to do good, but you feel extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and played baseball.
I’m happy to leave so far.”
Participants in the field were former Masters champions Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation is free and parking is available; <0xC2><0xA3>5 per vehicle with one person and <0xC2><0xA3>10 per vehicle with two or more people.

I found the answer
Think of a... Budget; with 6 billion 867 million Turkish Liras, including Economics, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science Industry and Technology, Environment and Urbanism, Health, Culture and Tourism! one of ten ministries in each month
Number of staff 117,378.
Turkey’s largest ‘propaganda base’!
Yeah, I'm talking about the Deaning Affairs Presidency!
Yes, I'm going to talk about Mehmet Görnez, President of Diyanet Affairs!
It's been days... I've been looking for answers to the question in my head...
I'm wondering the real reason why Mehmet Görmez was taken from his seat...
I've read every article you've read about sending.
Oh, no.
I can't find the answer to the question I'm looking for.
Earlier this year...
Mehmet Görmez has prepared the Strategic Plan 2017-2021 of the Presidency for Dianetics Affairs (DIB).
Under President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, a <0xC2><0xA3>1 million S 600 model Mercedes was withdrawn.
He had no problem with Erdogan.
So what happened?
You might say, "Seven years of service is not enough."
The first DIB President M. R<0xC4><0xB1>fat Börekçi served for 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz, as you all know, has been sitting on that chair for 11 years.
I mean, the president's term is open.
Again, I ask: Why did Mehmet Görez leave his seat?
Work is done...
Shia proximity
He said, "The people of the land, the people of the land, did not come to Mecca, and they did not come to Mecca."
The code of this sentence is this: He did not have sunshine!
The person who used this phrase said behind it: "It was found by traditional tradition modernist!"
I mean, Mehmet Görez was seen as an innovator.
What did innovation mean?
The answer to the question was hidden on Mehmet Görmez's expedition abroad.
Date: December 27, 2015.
Mehmet Görmez went to Iran to attend the 29th Covenant Conference in Tehran, which aims to bring Islam into closer proximity.
Iran’s religious leader Ayatollah Ali Hamaney met.
He prayed purely with the Shiite men.
And at the conference, he said, "Mezhepsis are the five schools that have been formed over time, representing different ideas and traditions in the understanding of the religion of Islam."
The purpose of all things is to determine the will of God.
Each one is on a straight path to the main road, but the place where they come is the same.
It is never acceptable to reflect the mezhebi or to see the mezhebi’s self above the religion of Islam.
Mezhebe-based separation, over-interaction and conflict is a reflection of expression and blindness.
The religion that is most damaging when the mezheps pass before the religion is itself the religion that is most damaging.
I would like to re-emphasize it by drawing gold here:
The Sunni and Shiites are one nation.
“No one can deny another because he perceives Islam as he understands it and does not live it.”
A year later...
Only Caferi leader Selahattin <0xC3><0x96>zgündüz from Turkey participated in the 30th Vahdet Meeting.
I mean...
Sunshine not Vihhhabiya
Mehmet Görmez’s visit to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of “traditional honor.”
This is why no one was represented by the Turkish state at the next conference in Tehran - yet -.
He hasn’t been invited four times since he came to the office.
The reason was obvious; the Shiite-Iran anti-Iranian "traditionalism!"
Immediately after the Iran trip, Mehmet Görmez’s seat began to be dismantled from the beginning of 2016.
At the beginning of this, the Deputy Prime Minister, Numan, was responsible for the DIB – my judgement – was saved!
Mehmet Görmes was so drowned that he wanted to "join the DIB Presidency."
It's all about...
There was a difference in the view of Sunniness in the state.
Theoretical worlds were associating "traditionalism" with Sunniness -in the shadow of the United States - Vehhabi-Selephilic as it was created in Saudi Arabia and Egypt!
These were Iranian opponents who were not even tahammuli on Tehran's trip.
The words of Ahmet the Cubbly concerning Mehmet Görmez were not astonishing: "There was no danger to Diyanet from this."
"My Lord, may you make a good journey for the people of your land and for those who are loyal to your homeland."
They used the "synthesis" as a symbolic concept of Iranian hostility.
For a time, the FETO, which was backed by the CIA, was now leading the opposition to Iran with new names.
In addition, with FETO sponges...
A photo of a young man with a whiskey in his hand was served to the media with the lie "Mehmet Görmez's son"!
Oh, what a coincidence!
Who made the biggest opposition to Mehmet Görmez in the media: the newspaper of the Lightning Society in the US in Turkey!
After all...
- Sunniness does not bring the Saudi Vehhabi-Selefi line...
- Who can't see the separation...
- Modernist... a religious man was destroyed by the "traditionalism" created by his conscience during the Cold War...
U.S. culture imperialism is rapidly continuing to Arabize Turkey (to make Vehhabi-Selefi).
Don’t hesitate to be the Vehhabi-Selefi representative of the upcoming Chief of Staff Affairs!

Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Golden Territory
Bardina Degei doesn't use January when cooking.
She rarely even uses a cup.
The housewife in the unsettled region of Indonesia in Papua, in a wooden house in Enarotali, in the vicinity of Paniai, usually puts a sweet potato known locally as a "note" directly on fire.
Half an hour later, the zipped wrist is taken and it is appetised and swamped, hands not washed.
Degei sits on the muddy floor, doing things like washing laundry with suffocating water from the nearby dam, with no furniture.
A coffin in a homeless sahara shell is in charge.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she has never been assigned to any field.
There's a variety here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed and drink too much, and there are soldiers.
"No one walks in the village after 5 p.m.," he says.
A controversial referendum in 1969, after which only 1026-year-olds were forced to vote by force in general before the unions occupy a rare view of daily living in the mountainous areas of Papua, a former Dutch colony absorbed by Indonesia.
It has directed an existing movement that promotes independence against the Dutch administration to the government of Jakarta, which quickly maintains strict control over the region, banning foreign journalists or law enforcement organizations.
In 2003, the region officially separated as Papua New Guinea and West Papua as it would occupy the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as close as it is; the trip here includes a 90-minute flight from the regional capital of Jayapura to Nabire and a 5-hour drive by rented vehicle.
There's no public transport.
In the city of 19,000 people, there are wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, broken iron fences transformed into various orange brown tones by paste.
Let the journalists, very few Indonesians have travelled here, and almost no foreigner has travelled here.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, he met the Mee Pago Papuans with a god named Uga Tamee.
There's been other changes.
She said, "We weren't used to wearing these clothes, with a vibrant, touching arm, a dark shirt, and a glossy shirt."
"We used to wear only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is the poorest region in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have the worst childhood deaths and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also the golden land of Indonesia.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran is located just 60 miles away from Pania, a mountainous area in the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
Only in 2015, Freeport removed gold and copper worth about <0x24>3.1 billion from here.
In addition, Papua is estimated to have reserves worth <0x24>78 billion.
What’s more, these wealth, which is a source of mourning for the Papuans, enables Indonesia’s powerful army to remain a drowning asset.
A 2005 study by the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units about <0x24>20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to <0x24>150,000 in grants to a single water.
The call for more autonomy by the papayas threatens this golden-egg chicken, and comes from their rights unreservedly.
According to rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian army since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
The mass massacres in Papua in the 1970s reached genocide figures according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators in the region last year alone.
The 2016 report of the Bishopric of Brisbane, “Everything We Lose,” is a saga of illegal executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electric executions are especially popular) and the brutality of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to calculate the number of victims each week because there are events," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at the Human Rights Watch.
Papua's resources brought settlers from other parts of Indonesia increased pressures.
The region's 3.5 million population is 83 percent Christian, but Indonesia's populous islands are changing demographics as Muslim immigrants from Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi come for economic purposes.
Javanese warung buffets sell gado-gado served with fried chicken and mixed place nuts with vegetables.
The locals are struggling to compete.
"Migrants sell chicken and vegetables cheaper than native Papuans in traditional markets," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old native of Paniai, who moved to the regional capital of Jayapura for work.
"This caused the indigenous Papuans to lose their Papuan mama-mama (women) on Sunday."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, promised to resolve inequalities and rights violations in Papua in the 2014 election campaign.
As the former carpenter progressed on the way to Jakarta's presidential palace, he won 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Panaia.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
“We were heartbroken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi with the expectation that justice would fulfill our hope of being re-established,” You said.
In fact, Panii only lived two months after Jokowi's entry into office in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children outside of Enarotali, singing Christmas songs in front of a sparkling fire, broke through two Indonesian military darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to open their lamps.
One of the soldiers drank in his battalions, and according to local priest Yavedt Tebai, he returned with four soldiers.
He said the victims and eyewitnesses were chasing the group of soldiers who had taken alcohol and were hitting their guns with their spears.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One of the boys, 16-year-old Julianus Yeimo, was hit so badly that he got into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government election commission building was set on fire and the next day events escalated.
About 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered to demand justice in a football field in front of the local police headquarters and military command center.
They carried ceremonial hunting springs and performed the waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua (running in public form and mimicking the bird bite).
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police and military garrison.
As the nerves became more tense, the command was sent to the soldiers via the internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them by killing them." This was an official paper not disclosed to the local media, seen by TIME.
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto neighbourhood in Enarotali, saw the danger approaching and demanded silence for the crowd to return home.
No one was going to listen.
She told TIME when she presented her brightly painted wooden house, "I was suddenly shot by my left wrist when I turned back."
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but he says the bullet came from a military garrison.
"It was a mob, it's been shot many times," he adds.
According to his cousin, the native Alfius Youw, who witnessed the attacks, was shot three times.
Like many Indonesians, John told TIME, “I ran to him and checked his body to make sure he was there.”
"I saw him dead, I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers had only “safeguarded” the barracks because the barracks were under attack.
In 2015, Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistio, head of the branch, said: "When people threaten to kill us, we have to defend ourselves."
"It's a matter of death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The news of the deaths reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an enthusiastic speech in Jayapura, stating that the families of the victims share the pain and promising to resolve the historic troubles in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it doesn't happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, security minister Wiranto said he had set up an illegal mechanism for historic human rights violations.
But the excuses almost immediately started.
“Most of the incidents happened a long time ago.
Some in the 90s and some in the early 2000s.
The point is that we are determined to resolve these violations, but there are processes that we need to go through.”
On June 5, Wiranto told TIME that he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be solved by law."
During East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, Wiranto, who accused more than 1,000 deaths related to "crimes against humanity," said that 11 human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai case, had already been resolved.
The families of the victims of Paniai welcomed such claims with a painful suspicion.
“I’ve been invited to talk four times over the past three years, but there has been no progress,” John says.
"I'm tired."
Years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the soldier, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Jacobus repeats his view that the people in Paniai are afraid to argue.
He says he was beaten by the soldier after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After they buried their ancestors, the soldier came to look for me," he says.
The attacks haven't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at the villagers in Deiyai's neighbourhood.
A man died in a clash between the manager of a construction company who refused to help take a man to the hospital with the peasants, and 17 people, including children, were injured.
The 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, drowned in a nearby lake while holding fish, died while going to the hospital.
The angry peasants protested in front of the company's construction office.
Police said the villagers had stoned the officials and that they had reacted by firing a warning.
But the indigenous people say the moving mob (Indonesian paramilitary police) fired at the crowd and killed someone.
Domingue Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the rearing of the wounded, told TIME: "We were very panicked, we were afraid of revenge."
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament called for the responsibility of the officials involved in the matter and the withdrawal of the moving police force from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live dispersed throughout Papua's green mountain centre.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM) by claiming to protect the rights of the Papuans by accidental attacks and pressures to kidnap Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya, come from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people were detained in Paniai and were detained in recent years by soldiers under the guise of "protection of national sovereignty".
Some will never be seen again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as a “tragic and forgotten place.”
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is very expensive for the natives to buy.
Bread is inaccessible.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly notes along with some fruit and leafy vegetables.
It's the job of women who can do farming with four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually store most of the harvest for the family, they sell the rest in the local market.
10 notes are only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the indigenous Papuans and more new air routes to Nabire Airport have increased since the opening of new air routes.
Things that are already scarce often go to better-educated and wealthier immigrants.
The Papuans rarely have the capital or qualifications they need to run their own business competitively.
John Gobai, chairman of the Panai Tribal Council, said: “Young people don’t care about staying in the village because there’s no work or money here.”
Tecrit keeps the world's eyes away from Papua.
Moreover, the information restrictions on the international media are tightened.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were rarely allowed to shoot videos, but Papua was excluded due to "lack of coordination with relevant institutions".
According to Phelim Kine, Assistant Director of the Asian Organization for the Monitoring of Human Rights, Jokowi’s campaign to increase transparency has not been lifted and promises of development have not been fulfilled.
In a statement, he said: "There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report on the restless easternmost provinces of Indonesia from Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and blacklisting."
The lack of press oversight means that the Indonesian government is largely confined to the international pressure of Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, B.M. encouraged six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters in Jakarta: "There is still a democratic system in Indonesia and free media, so it is difficult to overlook the evidence in human rights cases."
The locals want more foreign governments to take care of them.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands visited Jayapura on May 4 under the presidency of the country's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, a local source said it was "we want freedom."
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council, said: "Jokowi is a person with good intentions but is turned into a person involved in the Paniai attack."
Jokowi wants the Paniai people to know that, apart from living under the impending threat of a violent soldier, they are surrounded by the need for fake education and health services.
Gobai says, like the other Papuans, the Paniai people see it as a "smuggler" they give back their votes to Jokowi.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he said.
Despite threats and intimidations, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack carried out a last symbolic attack: burying a victim’s nephew in the ground in front of the police and military headquarters.
They will at least ensure that those responsible, knowing that justice can never be carried out, will not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," says Jacobus, heading forward.
"What else can we do?"
A fire engulfs Dubai's 'Meshale' sky for the second time
On Friday, a fire in Dubai smashed the world’s tallest towers, forcing hundreds of people to flee 79-storey structures 337 meters long.
This was the second major fire in two years to spread rapidly to a tall building called the Meshale Tower.
The building was emptied, no injuries were reported, and no explanation was made about the cause of the major fire.
“We were sleeping and we woke up in the fire alarm, people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about 10 minutes to get to the 50th floor," George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defense authorities said that the large fire crew had turned off at around 4 a.m. (00:00 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government said it was trying to provide shelter for those affected.
This event can bring back questions about the safety of the materials used in the outer parts of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the Meshale administration following the fire in 2015 found that most of the damage was in external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the UK, police said they believed the insulation and coating panel system on London's Grenfell Tower, where 80 people died, could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June.
More than 4,000 chronic ‘social aid’ news to patients
Under the Ministry of Family and Social Policies, the social assistance programme to be launched for poor citizens and their families who are struggling with chronic diseases will benefit 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients in the first stage.
The Ministry, which plans to provide monthly support over two-thirds of the minimum wage to patients with the aid program, will also provide regular psychosocial support.
According to the information obtained, the details and the principles of the "New Social Assistance Programme for Families Fighting Chronic Diseases" were identified, which began their work under the direction of Minister of Family and Social Policy Fatma Bethel Sayan Kaya.
The social assistance program, launched in cooperation with the Ministry of Health, in order to support citizens with economic and psychological difficulties who are struggling with chronic diseases, has the feature of being the world’s first in many respects.
The Ministry, which completes all the necessary preparations for the launch of the program, will provide regular psychosocial support to families not only in cash with the social assistance program.
Thus, the goal is not to leave their families alone, both materially and spiritually, with poor citizens living with chronic illness and continuing their treatment processes at home.
According to the studies carried out, in the first stage, the poor citizens struggling with Subacut sclerosis panencephalitis (SSPE), a brain disease caused by tuberculosis and rheumatoid arthritis, will be provided regular psychosocial and monetary support under the new social assistance programme.
In the advanced stages of the programme, poor citizens who are struggling with other rare and risky diseases will be included in the aid programme.
In addition to the planned support over two-thirds of the minimum wage, the patient's health unit can be determined that they are unable to take medical care of themselves, that they live their lives depending on the bed, or that the need to improve the living conditions at home will be established.
In order to benefit from the support, the minimum monthly income per person in the household seeks to be less than two-thirds of the net monthly amount.
Citizens with SSPE should also have a health board report that is regulated in accordance with the method and principles specified in the "Excuse Measurement, Classification and Regulation of Health Board Reports to Forgiven".
According to the survey, more than one in five U.S. passengers are carrying illegal substances on airplanes.
According to a survey of airline passengers, more than 20 percent have, knowingly or unknowingly, leaked illegal substances to aircraft from U.S. Department of Transportation Security checkpoints, including at least 6 percent carrying illegal knives or other sharp objects.
Less than one percent later claimed to have noticed that he accidentally travelled with firearms, explosives or explosives.
A study conducted by a jet rental service called Stratos Jet Charters, with more than 1,000 people, also found that younger passengers are more prone to breaking the rules.
19.7% of participants who admit that they are trying to fly knowingly with something banned by the TSA are Y-Generation, but less than 15 are X-Generation members.
The most common substances known to be stolen from TSA agents are foods and liquids.
While more than 3% admitted knowingly had sharper safety tools, 2.2 percent of female participants and 3.7 percent of male participants also admitted knowingly carrying illegal drugs on the plane.
The company said how many people accidentally brought goods from the airport's security and how they were deliberately investigating passengers across the country to find out if they were able to do so.
It's no surprise that the most likely people to get away with safety goods knowingly or unknowingly are the most flying people.
Still, as the company notes, the TSA rules are a bit confusing and confusing.
People are often unsure of what liquids or how much of them they can carry.
So it’s no surprise that the greatest amount of substance put into hand by TSA appears as prohibited liquids.
For a time, people thought that TSA might be treating books as escaping goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but are not allowed on international flights.
China welcomes U.S. statements
At a press conference in Beijing, China's Foreign Minister Vang Yi called on Tillerson's Pyongyang administration to "send our troops to the north of the 38th paralysis to seek regime change, the collapse of the regime, the rapid reunification of the peninsula, and to send our troops to the north of the 38th paralysis."
China's Foreign Minister Vang reiterated Tillerson's re-emphasis on the Washington administration's principles on the North Korean issue, and hoped that the United States would implement these principles effectively and concretely in a result-oriented policy.
Noting that the security of the Korean peninsula is a priority, Vang said that they expected the parties to find a middle ground where they could resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, and that the Beijing administration was to remove the peninsula from the nuclear, to protect peace and stability from the issue, and to solve the issues.
EPA President Pruitt Rejects Obama's Reverse Emission Reduction Laws
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, chairman of the Environmental Protection Organization, retracted the decision to postpone the implementation of Obama-era laws, which lowered air pollutant emissions that caused dirty smoke earlier.
Pruitt represented the change as his own organization was more sensitive to the needs of state environmental regulators than previous administrations.
He did not mention any legal objection to his previous position in a federal high court.
The states are starting to meet the deadline of the 2015 standards for soil level ozone on 1 October.
Pruitt announced that he would postpone compatibility in the warehouse for one year to give his organization more time to work on the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or preventing economic growth."
Before being appointed by President Donald Trump, Pruitt, Oklahoma’s chief prosecutor, had long served as a trusted ally against stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly taken action to block or delay the regulation against the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The immediate change on Wednesday is Pruitt's latest legal defeat for his agenda of reorganization.
A federal supreme court in Washington last month ruled that the EPA administrator's attempt to delay the implementation of methane leaks by oil and gas companies, which is an Obama administration law, has exceeded the limits of his authority.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt said that the reversal of ozone standards reinforced the EPA’s commitment to work through complex processes and timely compliance with new standards with states only.
Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous work, said: "Under the previous administrations, the EPA often fails to meet the final dates of decisions, waiting to be sued by activist groups and others and arranging their timing for the decision."
"We don't believe in ordering through lawsuits and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously.”
Nevertheless, the EPA's statement said that Pruitt could once again exercise "the power to override and all other powers that are legally available" at one point in order to ensure that the regulations are "supported by sound policies and best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pressuring for a wider rewriting of ozone laws.
A bill passed last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 law for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the EPA this week, said he intends to continue legal pressure on the group.
Schneiderman said: "The EPA's decision to change our cases is an important gain for the health and safety of more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the bad smoke that affects New York City and its communities."
The case joined New York from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and District of Columbia.
When cars, power plants, petroleum refineries, chemical plants and other sources reacting to sunlight in the atmosphere, general pollutants are released to form ozone at the ground level.
Dirty smoke can lead to serious breathing problems in a rapidly affected group of people, and contributes to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applauded Pruitt’s surprise decision-making change.
Lori Ann Burd, of the Center for Biological Diversity, said: "It's disturbing that it takes so much pressure from the man who's in charge of protecting the weather we're sitting to get this good name."
“We must continue to fight the ideological struggle of the Trump administration to discriminate against those who pollute the environment and interest groups.”
Inflation in the Middle East
Turkey, which recorded the biggest increase of 6 years in exports in July, drew unemployment to 10.5 in January, 13 percent, and the economic confidence index also peaked at 3.5 years, lowered inflation to a single household.
According to data released yesterday by the Statistical Agency of Turkey, the Consumer Price Index (CIP) rose 0.15 per cent in July, with annual inflation reaching 9.79 per cent for the first time since its launch.
According to the main spending groups in July, the highest increase was 1.75 per cent on a monthly basis in the restaurant and hotel group, with the group showing the highest drop in 3.51 per cent in clothing and shoes.
The highest annual increase occurred in the transport group at 15.24 per cent.
In July, Business Investment Economist Muammer Kark<0xC3><0xB8>rc<0xC3><0xB8>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu, noting that inflation, in parallel with expectations, was down to a single household, said: "In the moderate view of inflation, there is an effect on the fall in prices of food and clothing groups."
But the core indicators have an increase compared to the previous month in contrast to the manchet.
"We don't expect a relaxation in the tight position of the Central Bank," he said.
In spite of the decline in inflation, the core inflation indicators have risen.
Of the special comprehensive T<0xC3><0x9C>FE indexes closely monitored by the Central Bank, the B index rose from 9.07 per cent to 9.46 per cent in July, while the C index rose from 9.20 per cent to 9.60 per cent in July.
Capital FX Research Assistant Director Enver Erkan, stating that the year of inflation could close from the 9.3 percent level, said, “Inflation can fluctuate up to the month of December and fall to a single house in December.”
"The Central Bank may have the opportunity to take over the first months of 2018," he said in a statement.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet <0xC5><0xA0>im<0xC5><0xA1>ek: Inflation will be closed in a single household.
The tightening of the Central Bank will continue until inflation falls below 7 percent.
We will give the final form to reforms in the upcoming Food Committee.
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci: We are delighted that inflation has fallen on a one-digit scale, but it has to be permanent.
In the fight against inflation, there is also a need to increase the volatility of food prices.
Development Minister Lütfi Elvan: Due to the baseline impact in the coming months, an upward trend in annual inflation may be seen, but the fall in inflation will be apparent from the first months of 2018.
We expect annual inflation to fall even further downwards.
I wish Fenerbahçe success in his next match.
Storm Graz Technical Director Franco Foda said that his performance in the second half of the match against Fenerbahçe in the UEFA Europa League’s 3rd round was not enough to skip the round.
Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, Foda said that Fenerbahçe was a top-level team, "We couldn't use wings in the first half."
In the second half we set the balance.
We got a chance for the second goal.
I'm still proud of my team.
They changed the course of the game in the second half.
We could've been a little better.
The little things in the game were decisive.
"I wish Fenerbahçe success in his next match," he said.
Foda said that as long as they were in Turkey they felt very well and that they were happy with the hospitality they saw.
Fernando in <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul
Brazilian footballer Fernando Francisco Reges, who started his transfer talks with Galatasaray Club, arrived in Istanbul.
The Brazilian footballer who arrived at Atatürk Airport was greeted by the fans enthusiastically.
Fernando, whose yellow-red supporters were in love shows with speeches, left the airport by taking a special vehicle waiting for him under security measures.
Fernando, 30, who started his career in Brazil’s Vila Nova team, wearing the form of Estrela Amadora, Porto and Manchester City, serves on the midfield.
The Brazilian footballer is expected to sign a contract with the yellow-red team after passing health checks.
Galatasaray, which continues his transfer work, has signed a deal of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5.250,000 for Fernando, whom he has long been trying to join.
Flash Rakka Movement from the U.S.: Internal Security Force...
Colonel Dillon, who has been linked to the U.S. Department of Defense (Pentagon) through the administration of a videoconference from Baghdad, said the coalition-trained Rakka Internal Security Force (RIGG) had begun to settle in areas cleared from DEAS in the city.
"The Rakka Internal Security Force, which consists mostly of Arab and anti-DEAH local volunteers in the cleared areas of the city, continues to ensure order and prevent terrorists from fleeing or returning," Dillon said.
Dillon, who said this week that 230 more people had completed their training, said that "the number of forces in question is 850 so far."
Dillon said the coalition had been training the group in basic arms training as well as in first aid, armed conflict, scanning and checkpoint operations.
Dillon, who said his interest in the Rakka Internal Security Force was very intense, said the coalition would continue to scan applicants for education and employment.
The U.S.-led coalition is cooperating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, which form the main backbone of the PYD/PKK, in the acquisition of Rakka.
The PYD/PKK terror organization had appointed a PKK terrorist, Leyla Muhammad, to the co-chair of the Rakka Civil Governance Council.
It is alleged that the PKK/PYD members will also be within the military force in Rakka.
Dillon also announced that he was collecting heavy weapons from the opposition group called Shuheda Karyateyn (Shukuk) in the southern Syrian camp of El Tanif, which the US-led coalition cut back last week.
"After meeting with the leaders last week, the Shukuk brought back the heavy weapons and equipment the coalition gave them, but some small weapons and light vehicles were allowed to remain in them," Dillon said.
Last week, the U.S. said it had withdrawn its support from Shuuk on the grounds that it had gone out of the conflict zones it had agreed with Russia and was on patrol and was engaged in activities that were not related to DEASH.
In addition to the group DEA<0xC5><0x9E>, it is stated that it also wants to fight against the Besar Esed regime.
According to notes from a closed phone call, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
Notes of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia were sealed by the Washington Post.
In a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on January 27, Trump urged him not to publicly tell the public that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The U.S. president slapped the Mexican president, who held the wall open to the public, and said, “You can’t tell the press that.”
Trump started his presidential campaign on building a wall along the U.S. southern border and promised to pay for the project to Mexico.
Notes of the first meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published as a result of a heated dialogue.
Mr. Trump said the deal on the U.S. taking refugees to Australia was "masked", "perpetrated" and "aptly" and that after he offered the U.S. a ban on the placement of a refugee, the agreement under the Obama administration itself would be "simple."
Mr. Trump ended the speech by saying to Mr. Turnbull, "It wasn't the most ugly speech I've ever had all day."
The patient broke the doctor's nose.
Turkey’s Higher Education and Research Hospital doctors and staff have quit their short-term job yesterday morning in order to respond to a doctor’s friends being squeezed by patients’ relatives.
The crowd gathered in front of the main entrance of the hospital with the words "No Violence in Health" in their hands, responded to the incident.
Prof. Dr. Feyza Ay<0xC5><0x9F>enur Paç, Head of Children's Cardiology Clinic at the hospital, said: ""No violence in health" sounds to me like an inadequate, or even side slogan."
In health, there is no place for violence.
"If this is the way it is going, the people will not find a health group to serve themselves soon," he said.
Dr. Kamil Turkmen, General Secretary of Public Hospitals of the First District of Ankara, Prof. Dr. Suer Odaba<0xC5><0x9F>, Turkish Higher Education and Research Hospital Ba<0xC5><0x9F>hekki Prof. Dr. Mustafa Paç.
When he denounced the case, he said:
Unfortunately, the violence against health workers is increasing.
An example of this incident is that we were resurrected yesterday evening (the day before) by our cardiac surgeon being squeezed by a patient closest to him.
In order for these events to come to an immediate end, we demand that our people, as our state, ministries, and governments, take the necessary measures to ensure that these events end quickly.
Yesterday's events were on behalf of my hospital and my health workers.
Odaba<0xC5><0x9F>, who noted that the public should be aware of violence in health, said, "Unfortunately, this time we lived in has become a professional complication."
"We will take our own precautions, too, but most importantly, our nation has its own health care professional," he said.
Turkmen, who said the trial on the matter had begun, said: "Our laws on violence in health have been implemented effectively enough."
This is what the state ranks do.
She's working on security right now.
In the past, they have always been empty, but now it's a direct public case, and the state is serving as a lawyer, following up on the case.
"There are also severe penalties taken in this regard," he said.
After the statements, the employees continued to work.
The incident allegedly took place at 5:45 p.m. the day before.
The patient's relatives, who lost his life in intensive care, attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet <0xC3><0x96>zbek, who worked in the Heart and Blood Surgery department, who reported death.
Uzbek was removed from the scene by doctors and assistants; the police were called to the hospital.
In the incident, Uzbekistan’s nose was broken, the attackers were arrested.
One of the witnesses to the incident said:
When our friend went to the patient’s loved ones to report the condition of a patient who had lost his life, the patient’s loved ones held us responsible and attacked our two friends.
Our friend's nose is broken, he's in the blood.
Then we took our friend into the operating room and hid him.
We had a security set between us for 15-20 minutes.
If the patient's loved ones had crossed that safety wall, there would have been much worse things.
Heavy blow to DEA<0xC5><0x9E> in Gaziantep: 102 troops...
According to the information obtained, in the framework of the investigation undertaken during the Prosecutor-General of the Republic of Gaziantep, the Gaziantep Security Directorate undertook a 10-year investigation into the operation of the DEA<0xC5><0x9E> Armed Terrorist Organization, which resulted in a 10-year investigation of the Kremlin's Directorate of Combating Terrorism in the Department of Gaziantep.
In the operation where 6 people were detained, the suspects were detained in about 70,000 units, including 10 long-range guns, 35 pcs of chargers, 2 370 pcs of chargers, 3,500 pcs of chargers, 3 pcs of guns, 1 pcs of chargers, 2 pcs of chargers and 38 pcs of chargers.
Four books were also found in the searches, drawn up by the publishing bodies of the FETO/PDY terrorist organization and decided to gather.
The six people who were taken under surveillance were sent to the courts after their interrogations.
The suspects were detained under the Sulh Penal Code, their sentencing guard.
The YPG rain in Syria...
The U.S. intervened
According to information obtained by AA from local sources, YPG terrorists, with U.S. military support, plundered the homes of residents of Tel Semin city in northern Rakka, where the terrorist organization entered into the fight against DEA<0xC5><0x9E> on grounds.
The reaction of the robbed and handcuffed civilians turned into a conflict with the terrorist organization.
In addition, U.S. forces in the area entered the city with armored vehicles.
The "Cougar MRAP"-type buffers, personnel carrier vehicles, and Husky-type mining detection tools were seen to create buffer zones in the city.
The terrorist organization YPG does not allow civilians fleeing death in Rakka, which was fired in the context of an anti-DEAH operation, to enter the cities under control.
The local activist network called "Rakka is silently massacred" announced that 121 civilians were killed in the group's bullet fire in July alone.
Let's not fight the old world tomorrow.
Delayed perception of the realities of the country and the world can lead to countries being dragged into crises, not by simple people.
One of the reasons why the backward East is delaying the perception of world realities in the form of "songfulness" we call it, may be that the reflection of these realities in the geographies of the East is blocked by certain chambers, or that these facts are actually overreacted.
Don Kishot and Oblomov have also been the subject of the world of literature, whether or not to be perceiving the facts and change lately.
Cervantes' "Don Chisot" is a matchup that still calls himself a knight when the bourgeoisie begins to form.
Or, Gonçarov’s “Oblomov” is a legacy that believes that everything can last as it used to be.
For example, until the end of the 15th century, China was a country open to the world and dominated by the seas, as a result of the passing of a detainee dynasty.
This has been the case until the captains of ships coming out of China’s black waters have been executed.
We Turks in the West with one leg, eye and ear, and the other with the East with the Turks, we have experienced constant dilemmas about perception of facts and change, starting with the Ottomans.
We've tried to carry the old and the new day of our chapter to today, to understand today with concepts that follow the old conditions, to guess tomorrow.
One of our sections, we were able to act as quickly as the centers of thought in developed countries, both in terms of realities of the country and the world, and also in terms of perception of change.
This has led to constant conflicts and tensions.
The encounters of Medrese with the university, modern army and innovation, doubts with faith, led to a dramatic dualism of content.
Even worse, it was not accepted that attitudes that were new and advanced at a time would eventually become old and remain behind.
After a period of time, the day’s progressives began to declare the new and advanced “dangerous”, while those who tried to interpret the current state of the country and the world in a way that was consistent with the current reality began to declare “hain.”
The most important lesson in the Ottomans was that those who perceived the country and the world by delayed the facts would eventually dominate the thought and state life, the empire collapsed, and the people became poor.
The most important lesson that our Ottoman past conveyed to the Republic was the fact that the rapid perception of the world’s conjunction and change was an inevitable prerequisite for staying up.
Since this lesson is very well-trained, we have been able to be the exemplary country of this geography, which has managed to preserve its unity, integrity, stability in peace since World War I.
In order to be able to skip the process of global change in a different way, we need to leave behind memories and act in accordance with the facts.
In other words, no one will benefit from the meaningless campings and bloodshed that have led to the development of our democracy in the past.
In addition, the smallest mistakes in today’s world lead to very big and dramatic crises.
The most difficult geography in this regard is the Middle East in which we are located.

Category: Winds of Turkey
The global giants, who are confident of Turkey’s future, have struggled to break through the wind power plant that took place yesterday.
The model set by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources to reduce its external dependence to ensure the transition to national energy has broken the world record.
Turkey's investment of <0x24>1 billion and close to 4,000 jobs have also opened the way to lowering energy costs.
Indigenous production wind turbines will be included in the system by 2019.
Eight consortiums, including US, Chinese, German and Danish giants, have joined the wind turbine license initiative for renewable resources (YEKA), which was opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.
In the report, financial tenders were opened with the aim of identifying the 5 bidders who initially made the lowest bid.
The lowest bid was <0x24>4.19/kilovatsah after the first bid bids.
The open extrusion range was set to 0.01 cents.
After the rally began, Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas decided to join the joint venture groups.
In the open competition, the groups in which Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang participated competed.
Following the withdrawal of the Nordex consortium, MingYang-First Construction and Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon remained the last two.
MingYang-First Construction took a break 11 times.
The Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon Energy Consortium has never paused.
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak: a record day for Turkey.
The opening round continued for 30 rounds.
The winner of the intense controversy between the two consortiums was the Siemens-Turker-Kalyon joint venture group, which made the lowest bid at <0x24>3.48 cents/kilowatt hour.
While the consortium offered <0x24>3.49 cents/kilovat hour in the petition, Müste<0xC5><0x9F>ar Adjudicator Alparslan Bayraktar drew the offer to 3.48 at the request of the petition commission in the chairmanship of the petition.
As a result of the two-hour YEKA event, Turkey achieved a world record.
The figure per kilowatt-hour offered in the report went down to date as the lowest in the world.
The previous record was held by Mexico at <0x24>3.84 per kilowatt-hour.
After the conclusion of the report, the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Berat Albayrak, who organised the press conference, said that the German company Siemens’ victory was an important message to the region and the world, "in Turkey and Germany's 200-year-old historic cooperation in this respect."
Our goals are big.
The result that emerged today has shown how robust and secure the economy and energy market is in the future.
Regardless of the regional crises in the world, I was very proud to show that Turkey is at the forefront of the region and the world’s most reliable investment countries.
"The whole of Turkey, which we will be proud of as 80 million, is our President who brings Turkey to this point, within his 15 years of power and leadership," he said.
Albayrak, expressing that they are launching a new era with open, transparent and comparative competition, said: "This is one of the most important steps, with a real share of the local contribution to the wind until yesterday," with a cost of <0x24>10.3 per kilowatt hour, a cost of <0x24>48 per kilowatt per year.
I am proud of this, on behalf of my people, on behalf of my country.
“We hope to include our domestic production wind turbines in the system by the end of 2018,” said Minister Albayrak, stating that they aim to implement the first domestic production panels in solar energy.
The turbines will be installed in 5 designated areas.
The company that won the competition will employ a total of 1,000 megawatts of wind power in each of these 5 regions under the condition of establishing at least 50 megawatts of wind power in each of these 5 regions.
The total investment of Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon Group will be over <0x24>1 billion.
As local wind turbines enter operation, at least 3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity will be generated each year, and around 1.1 million homes will meet their annual electricity needs.
The wind turbines will also provide an average of 1.5 million tons of CO2/year emission reductions.
The company that won the competition will build a factory with an investment of over <0x24>100 million.
The plant will produce an average of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines with a power of at least 2.3 megawatts.
The consortium will work R&D in at least 5 areas for 10 years in at least three areas of innovative gearbox, software and manufacturing technologies, wing, generator design, material technology and gearbox.
With a budget of <0x24>5 million each year for R&D work, 80 percent of the technical staff, consisting of local engineers, will work.
The factory will be established 21 months after the contract is signed.
The duration of the project license is 30 years.
Kaz<0xC4><0xB1>m Türker, Chairman of the Board of Turkers Construction, in the consortium that won the award, said that the project will be about 64 per cent of domestic production, 35 per cent of the equipment will come from abroad, while the "fundament of the equipment remains in the banks, foreign sources."
Turker said the leak reflected confidence in the Turkish economy.
Kalyon Holding Energy Group chairman Murtaza Ata said: "There is a desire to reduce Turkey's external dependence on 1,000 megawatts more."
"We're happy with the result," he said.
Siemens Gamesa Turkey Chief Executive Hakan Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m also stated that they have been operating in Turkey for 160 years, saying, "We will do our best to reduce the cost of electric units more."
The indigenousity rate of wind turbines to be produced in the factory will be at least 65 percent.
65% of the 8,000 industrial parts in the wind turbine will be indigenous (at least 5,200).
A facility of at least 50 MW will be established in each of the 5 regions, totalling 1,000 MW.
3.750 people will spend 10 years of R&D for <0x24>5 million in R&D activities each year
1000MW Wind Plant 65% Locality Rate Production of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines with at least 2.3 MWe power.
Investment over <0x24>1 billion in 400 MW/year wind turbine production capacity over <0x24>100 million in factories.
Electricity production that will meet the needs of approximately 1.1 million households is at least 3 billion kWh of electricity production per year, with an average of 1.5 million tons of CO2/year emission reduction.
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Revive the Racist Lens Event for Call to Justice
A 1948 model Ford Mercury was passed between a group of spectators in the rural Monroe Georgia and headed toward the small Ford Bridge in Moore.
The car, with four black passengers and a white driver, emerged to block the road before reaching the bridge by a group of armed white men.
The leader of the gang, a man in a medium-aged, thin-line suit, took a long breath from the purse and looked carefully inside from the front window.
Inside, the people were scared.
"We want this z.....i, Roger!" the man whispered.
"Get him out of the way!"
When a young black man was pulled out of the front passenger seat, the screams went through the darkness.
Fortunately, this terrifying scene played on June 22 is not just a revival.
But when an illusion was thrown around Roger's neck, almost everyone from the audience breathed quite realistically.
Since 2005, human rights defenders have returned to the Ford Bridge in Moore to revive two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) who were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one has been charged with murder.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the revival, said: "While we see them in our communities, we don't realize that no one has been arrested for all these years, even if we know who they are."
"A mark on this history, but a burden on our souls."
Brooks, a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong human rights defender.
For himself, this revival carries a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that injustice has never been rectified.
He said, "We want a trial, we want a result, we want wounds to be healed, we want a reconciliation, but we have to get justice first."
"We can't have wounds until we get justice to embrace and make a deal."
On July 27, 1946, the forensic officer lays a plaque on the body of one of the victims of the Ford Line in Moore.
According to NBC News, Monroe and more than 50 men from surrounding areas are suspected of lynching.
But one of them has never been investigated.
While suspects have been fugitives for decades, human rights defenders say the twin motivations of lynxes are always well known everywhere in the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling made it possible for black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time at the end of that summer.
According to the FBI, almost at the same time, black partner Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, who owns a white land, apparently as a woman during a fight.
Brooks stated that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she carried was not her own husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a leading white landowner, paid <0x24>600 to get Malcom out of prison.
Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray were imprisoned in George Dorsey's prison.
But when they got to the Ford Bridge in Moore, while they were driving away from the prison, a gang of lynx gangs surrounded the car.
An FBI report concludes, "It's clear that it's Harrison who arranged the murders and gave the order."
"It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between the state and local Armed Forces that they have not only been involved in the murder, but have destroyed the evidence, and have hidden the identities of the eyewitnesses."
Brooks said it shorter and self-explanatory.
He said, "It was a right to vote."
“All of them were killed to send a message to the black people in this community: ‘This is what you will be doing if you register and vote.’”
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has been in charge of reviving the Ford Bridge linings at Moore every year.
Its performance takes into account all the details, it’s striking, and it’s based on a deep kind of racism that many believe no longer exists in America.
It's harder to watch and even harder to turn their eyes around, but Greene says that's the point.
He said, "We don't want to talk about the lens because it confronts us all with the ugliness within us."
"But if you don't listen to me or if you don't listen to me, I can't develop a relationship with you."
Proofs of this year's production began in the fire, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors (a dozen whites and the rest blacks) entered a room, and when Greene entered the well-tested general lines of the game, they listened willingly.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has played the role of President Clansman for years, but he says the role has never been easier.
Marbaugh said, "I feel relaxed because it's not me."
“But I think it’s very important to keep this past alive because we don’t want to go back to that time.”
Throughout the room, actors Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester were testing their own lines, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona.
Malcom starts the game by screaming at Hester, who is very angry because he is sleeping with his wife Dorothy.
"Z...i, I said, get out of my property!"
Rascona reacts.
There's a sound of a shot.
And then everyone (at least black actors) drowns in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
Rascona asked, "What?"
He was upset, surprised.
Am I too hard?
Greene said "no" in the dickheads.
"I don't think it was just that white people called z...i."
One of the black players threw a mixed stone with a joke saying "yes."
"You've got to push R."
Thus, the energy in the room changes and some sort of intimacy takes the place of unrest.
Everyone is dedicated to doing it right, not only for the sake of the game, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, Rascona says the word that begins with N, sharp and emphatic.
No one's laughing.
The revival ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, gunfire, and then silence.
A woman on the funeral list stands on the actors' bodies and reads Billie Holiday's sad memoir "Garip Fruit".
It breaks the voice in one of the two words.
An average of four dozen spectators behind the yard wiped their sweat and tears from their eyes.
The viewer is divided almost equally, including black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, most of the way forward.
While the Brooks took them on a sacred journey to the Malcom and Dorsey cemeteries, they all remained in Georgia's oppressive cloud for almost eight hours.
At this point, the murders had remained an anecdote, but stopping at the same place where the lynx is now means the air sounds damned.
As the last notes of the song weaken, Greene invites the crowd to approach and examine their bodies.
Kids crawl on their hands, crawling fake blood and immobile bodies and whispering to each other.
A little boy whispered to himself, "They're not really dead."
After a few minutes, Greene thanked the crowd and suddenly ended.
Actors throw the linseed and wipe out their tears.
Bradshaw, the team that plays President Klansman, is hugging Marbaugh.
Nick Rascona is embraced by two of his fellow actors, and tears are wiped out in their arms, and the emotional cost of performance finally comes to him.
One of the women whispered, "It's okay."
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Afterwards, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
On a table, a white couple from Atlanta talks diligently about reviving a black couple.
Denise Duplinski finds it hard to find words about how performance feels to her.
He said, "It's terrible to hear bad words, and those behaviors... come out of people who look like you, and they do it because they look like you."
"What this has done to me is to make the lynx think it's still going on," he added, "it's just called police-armed attacks."
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks has a center of interest while eating dinner at the table and telling her memories of human rights.
He said he already started planning for next year's performance.
He said, "Resurrection is inspiring in some way because it describes what we have endured, but it is also a teaching."
"It's like if you don't learn from it, it might be again.
Those who don’t investigate their own past, those who don’t know their own past, are obliged to repeat it.”
Accident in Mu<0xC4><0x9F>la: 4 dead; 6 wounded
According to the information received, the 48 YS 411-plate car under Adam Sa<0xC4><0x9F>lam's administration collided with the 09 B 1510-plate car under Sinan K<0xC4><0xB1>ro<0xC4><0x9F>lan's administration, on the Kavakl<0xC4><0xB1>dere-Yata<0xC4><0x9F>an road.
A large number of health and rescue teams were sent to the 112 Emergency Call Center instead of the scene.
Duraniye Kr<0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lan, who was 8 months pregnant with Duraniye Kr<0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lan and Yasemin Sahlam, lost her life on the scene of the incident, while Mertcan Kr<0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lan was removed from the hospital.

AK Party special website for congress
By AK Party, 6.
A website called "akkongreler.com" was established for the ongoing Congress process.
On the website, a brochure, material and images that the party organization will use in this process were provided.
In the section "Communication Strategy" of the site, the rules to be followed during the congress process were ranked in chapter 14.
President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, who posted the message on the website, and AK Party President-General Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an warned the members of the organization to comply with the party's corporate identity during the congress.
In Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s message, “Now we are beginning a new era of kick-off.”
We need to be renewed and refreshed in order to achieve our 2023 goals with more solid steps.
"We should continue to work shoulder to shoulder, as we did yesterday," he said.
Pearson did more than 3000 jobs to revitalize the business, cut off profit share
British training group Pearson said it would start another restructuring program to cope with the pressures faced by the company, and on Friday it would cut more jobs and cut its share of interim profits by 72 percent.
Chief Executive John Fallon said the withdrawals, which will mostly come at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, will add to the 4,000 positions lost in the previous redevelopment.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to save <0xC2><0xA3>300 million (US<0x24>394 million) more by attempting to quickly re-establish digital learning with a third cost reduction program.
The company, which agreed to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said there was no change in the outlook this year after reporting a 1% increase in its core sales in the first half.
Textin 2 led to death again!
According to the first report of the Forensic Medical Association, Hakan's first findings in the preliminary autopsy report suggest that death is suicide.
In the detailed examination carried out, no rash and blister imprints were found in the child’s body.
The reason for the suicide is because the elastic bandage around the neck is tightened and breathless.
It was also determined that the waistline indicated by the family as a wrap belt is an elastic bandage used in wounds.
After the preparation of a detailed report on the death of the child from the newspaper Habertürk, it was learned that it would be sent to the Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Büyükçekmece, who is investigating the case as a suicide.
Police are investigating the child's suicide in every detail, as well as conducting inspections on the handheld computer after the incident.
It was also stated that Hakan's colleagues will appeal to the police.
It is also stated that relatives of the so-called "Cleaned" Hakan can be accessed by third parties or a gang with the information obtained from the computer.
Police estimate that Hakan may have been dragged to suicide by a gang.
The certainty of Hakan's suicide turned his eyes into "Metin2" with violence.
The area that reacted on the grounds that it led to addiction and violence in children came to the agenda last year with the assassination of 13-year-old "minic hacker" Metin Kang, who was banned from the Antalya Governorate for children under 15 years of age in 2009.
You need to enter the site and register a member to play the "Metin2", which was designed in Korea in 2005.
Players try to provide peace and justice in the world with the dragon god in the game.
In doing so, wars occur, the dose of violence increases.
The game also includes battle images made with cutters, hollow weapons such as rows, swords, sticks, butterflies, as well as images where humans are defeated by wild animals.
The player buys characters with money to strengthen.
Esenyurt <0xC4><0xB0>stiklal Mahallesi Köknar Street, a family who gave their children to the ground the next day, continued the murder allegation.
When Father Mehmet II said, "The whole dream was to be a doctor, we don't think he could hurt himself or anyone else because of the game," he said, "They've clawed the elastic waist on his neck and threw a knot aside."
That's how it was, son.
We certainly don’t think that our son can commit suicide or harm to himself and others because of a game over the Internet.
We knew he was playing a game like that.
It wasn’t a game he played.
Let's say he'd let you out of the game when you're a little bored.
Mother Gülizard II: "There is no one who enters and goes into the universe."
It's said that at a certain time my child entered the house.
None of them hold each other.
When his brother came home, he had only one chair.
"But when he was buried, he had two chairs next to his computer," he said.
KARA<0xC5><0x9E>: He may have been infected with the gang
Families generally don’t pay attention to this.
They look at me, no matter what happens at home, my child.
The kid is communicating with a lot of people through games.
There may have been a loan lending situation, or a curse.
Or if you have invited someone in the game home, you may have had a problem between them.
He may have been affected not by direct play, but by problems with other people he communicated through the game.
The child may have realised the visuality of the game.
Suicide-driven trauma can be related to blackmail.
If the child has faced a family complaint, there's also a situation where he can't solve the problem.
He couldn't have committed suicide because of the game.
The kid's got a chance to get into a gang.
He may have been infected with the gang.
It’s not something that the child can do on his own.
Füsun NEB<0xC4><0xB0>L, Counsel for Knowledge Systems: Families Should Know the Interaction of Children
We can't say the games are harmful.
Studies have also shown that games are beneficial for the development of children.
The important thing here is to pay attention to what moms and dads play with their children and how they talk to the players online.
Families should take precautions to know what contents children are affected by.
In Turkey, there are only two children who are said to have died from the game in five years.
This also shows that putting an end to a child’s life is not just the effect of games.
What's this kid got to do with it?
We need to find out first.
You need to look at the sociology and psychology around the child.
The stock market in Istanbul stood at 50 per cent for 8 months
The BIST 100 index continued its uptrend, which began in December 2016, in July, and carried its uptrend to the top for the 8th month.
Thus, for the first time since July 2007, the index gained 45.3 per cent in this period when it recorded an 8-month high.
With its performance since the beginning of the year, Germany, the U.S., the UK, Japan, and the BIST 100 index, which has left behind the world's leading stock exchanges, did not leave the lead on a return-based basis in July.
The Dow Jones index in the U.S. followed the FTSE 100 index, which completed the BIST 100 index up 7.06 per cent in July, with an increase of 2.54 per cent, followed by 0.81 per cent in the UK.
The Nikkei index in Japan and the DAX index in Almaya ended in July with a loss of value.
Looking at the January-July period, it was found that the BIST 100 index exhibited a high performance from both the major world stock exchanges and the developing countries' stock exchanges.
The BIST 100 index, which won 37.6 percent in 2016, followed by a 10.76 percent increase in the Dow Jones index, a 5.55 percent gain in the DAX index, a 4.55 percent increase in the Nikkei index, and a 3.21 percent increase in the FTSE 100 index.
The MSCI EM index in terms of indicators for developing countries' stock exchanges yielded 23 per cent.
When we looked at the historical process of the BIST 100 index, we saw similar performances in the past.
The BIST 100 index, which lasted 8 months between December 2006 and July 2007, had a 38.3 percent increase in this period.
The BIST 100 index also completed 8 months between August 1996 and March 1997, 9 months between May 1997 and January 1998 by gaining a top score of 9 months between August 1996 and March 1997.
Eren Can <0xC3><0x9C>müt, Director of Investment Research in Mecca, told AA reporters, stating that the BIST 100 index has continued to rise for 8 months, noting that the increase has exceeded 37 percent since the beginning of the year.
The company noted that MSCI’s emerging markets (EM) index had risen 23 percent, and that even when we look at these rates, there was a positive dividend:
The flow of funds to developing countries has been ongoing since the beginning of the year.
In particular, funds within the high-revenue search prefer countries that give higher interest rates.
In this case, domestic markets are positively impacted.
Of course, the appetite for taking risks on a global scale is also very high.
As a result, stock indices in risky asset status are overwhelming.
In the U.S., the S&P 500 index has been testing its new record levels almost every week, with an increase of close to 11 percent since Christmas.
Utmüt, who underlined earlier this year that the U.S. Central Bank (Fed) projected a 3% interest rate increase to put markets under stress, but that the Fed’s verbal policy of routing quite well eliminated uncertainty, found that the Fed was in a market that was reluctant to increase interest rates.
The statement said inflation in the U.S. was not yet at the desired level, the Fed would not be in a hurry to increase interest rates, and its expectations of avoiding radical moves were quite effective at current prices.
The U.S. President, Donald Trump, says he has strengthened his perception that he can’t cancel the health reform known as “Obamacare” and that he will not be able to deliver on his expanding financial policies, and hopes that “the more likely the US economy is to grow faster thanks to Trump.”
<0xC3><0x9C>müt said, noting that 2016 was a year of many negatives for Turkey's markets, it was within a similar effort to close the difference between the negatively separated and over-sold BIST 100 indices.
<0xC3><0x9C>müt, who said they did not see a strong accumulation with domestic news flow, noted that the current outlook could be interpreted as triggering the difference between domestic markets in terms of similar increases in risk-taking appetites abroad.
Ummüt, who technically tested new records with 108,600 levels, recorded the following, stating that it watched a quantity of profit sales on the BIST 100 index:
In particular, 109,500-110,000 regions are a critical threshold in the short term.
After approaching these levels, it is normal for snow sales to take place.
In the short term, we think that a new local or global story needs to be created for pricing over 110,000.
So far, a downward shift in support of 107,500 could trigger profit sales.
In this case, I think if we follow the 107,000 relays, we can see a slowdown to 106,000-105,500 regions.
Particularly, the breakdown of 105,500 support can bring back to 104,300, which is equivalent to 50 percent of Fibo’s increase from 100,000 to 108,600.
The Fed and the European Central Bank's (ECB) decisions will be at the focal point of the global market, and the expectations for the Fed are already clear, but it is not expected to increase interest rates in September at FOMC.
The hope, stating that this situation could trigger profit sales in stock indices of the developing country, which is under the shadow of over-acquisitions in the short term, is "the most important thing is what the ECB will say."
Following the July meeting of the monetary policy board, ECB President Mario Draghi said they would discuss monetary policy in the fall and that this led to a rise of the euro/dollar parity to 1,1700 levels.
Thus, the announcement that the 60 billion euros per month asset purchase program will be reduced or could be terminated will mean that the ECB will also reduce the Fed’s post-liquidation on a global scale.
"Therefore, there may be negative prices on behalf of the markets of countries with high current open and mandatory access to foreign funds such as Turkey," the assessment concluded.
Erol Gurgan, head of Investment Investment Advisory, said he was experiencing a rather serious rally on global stock markets in November 2016 following Trump’s election as president of the United States.
Georgian noted that the key element that triggered this rally movement was possible by increasing global growth expectations, including Trump’s promises of initial tax cuts:
The Istanbul Stock Exchange was also at the top of the stock exchanges that emerged at the global rally.
While one of the main reasons for this is that the BIST 100 indexes have remained fairly skeptical compared to the emerging markets in recent years, it is useful to say that the steps taken by policymakers to support the economy and financial markets have also played a serious role.
In particular, we can say that the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF), which became active as of March, has a serious impact on the so far observed rise in the index.
For the remainder of the year, Gürcan, which reports that the positive developments are reflected in prices to a significant extent, and that the decline of the KGF, which plays an important role in this increase, has also slowed to maturity, may still be similar to the BIST 100 index, but it is still a bit late in the current market.
The 180-day action plan, which has been expected to share its details for a while, especially with interest, ensures that developments such as possible tax reductions coming to the near future, such as the increase in the limit of the Loan Guarantee Fund, are made in the direction of corporate profits.
The Fed, the Fed, and the Bank of England, which are the major central banks of the developed countries, are the most important ones, the most important ones, the most important ones, the most important ones, the most important ones, the most important ones, the most important ones, the most important ones, the most important ones, the most important ones, the most important ones, the most important ones, the most important ones, the most important ones, the most important ones.
In the next period, Gürcan says that the 104.150-104.600 support area, which corresponds to a moving average of 200 hours since the beginning of the year, is quite critical in the possible correction movements in the index. In the case of a fracture of this support area, it can be as high as 10,000, or as high as 10,200.
Gürcan said that if the current upward trend is maintained and the resistance of 108,605, which is at its current historic peak, the index could rise to the range of 110,000-112,000.
Kabul Convoy Attack: NATO Military Killed in Suicide Attack
Officials said a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a NATO soldier, and injuring several.
In a statement, NATO said five soldiers and one translator were injured.
Unconfirmed local sources say three civilians were killed in the incident in the Karabakh region.
The last act of violence in Afghanistan this month, more than 30 people were killed in a bomb blast in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said on Thursday evening that it had been attacked by a "personal hand-crafted explosive device" in a joint patrol mission with the Afghan army.
The statement said all the injured were in good condition and were being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
Reporters say the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh are a major source of concern for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan witnessed the deaths of at least 1,662 civilians in the first half of 2017, with an average of 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bombing car killed at least 30 people in the predominantly Shia area of Kabila.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack themselves.
On May 31, after U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people in the country’s deadliest militant attack.
The act of violence underscores the unstable security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump puts his weight on increasing the number of U.S. troops helping the country’s army and police.
Reporters say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have led to a crisis in the government, its policies and especially the public's confidence in President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA has stopped delaying air pollution rules after cases
The U.S. Environmental Protection Organization (EPA) has resigned from its decision to postpone the legislation that requires states to block emissions that cause ugly smoke, an Obama-era law, one day after the 15-state organization sued the initiative.
The EPA announced on Wednesday that it showed its determination to work with the states late in the afternoon, saying it would continue with the "2015 Ozone Decisions".
In a statement, EPA President Scott Pruitt said, "We believe we are sensitive to dialogue with and with our state partners."
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the EPA to postpone its ozone decisions by one year until October 2018, with these decisions, which mean that the existing dirty smoke pollution is measured in various parts of the country and that there is a need to decide where to cut off to meet more stringent air quality standards.
A lawsuit was filed on Tuesday with 15 mostly Democratic states that said the effort was illegal.
As part of Trump’s broader agenda to revive economic growth, the Trump administration is continuing its quest to retrieve the environmental regulations in a wide range that have been put in place by former President Barack Obama.
But these efforts have led to the reaction of conservative groups who are concerned about the effects of Democrats and more emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says breathing air containing ozone can "reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma."
The forest gave the good news...
Stops in line and wing transfers!
Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> President Fikret Forman made statements to Bein Sports about the transfer of Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and stopper.
The Forest of Ides said this...
There's no surprise in the transfer.
Our goal is not a lot of transfers, it's a point shot.
Now we're going to do a stopper and a wing transfer.
We have Champions League games, hopefully we'll have a good rule.
We've got to make a mandatory wing transfer.
10 million euros is easy, but we don’t have that kind of budget.
If it comes to the budgets we say, we transfer, and if we don't, we don't die.
I can't give you any information about the lens before it's cleared.
We are an open company to the public.
The end of patience is peace.
Is there a threat to ISID only for August 30 for the festival?
Ankara’s government continues to respond to a ban on all public events, including sitting actions, commemorative meetings and similar events, including concerts throughout August, on the grounds of the “Daesh threat”.
The government's banning decision includes the expression "all collective activities" in Ankara, 7.
The International Grand Ankara Festival is still going on.
Levent Gök, Chairman of the CHP Group and Ankara Member of Parliament, said in a statement to S<0xC3><0x96>ZC<0xC3><0x9C>, "It can't even be affected by the August 30 bans," and said:
He's got a serious headache.
The government is even hesitant about what decision it will implement...
The task of the state is to create areas where the holidays will be celebrated.
"All of Ankara has security problems, only Gökçek's organizations have no security problems," the MP Murat Emir said.
Ankara Independent Member Aylin Nazliaaka moved the bill to the Assembly.
Nazliaka, who offered the Prime Minister’s reply, said, “Isn’t this forbidden AKP’s republic and Atatürk’s hostility clearly revealed? How do you think to prevent the millions who will celebrate August 30 in the fields?”
"I've learned from Edwina that I've been cheated."
Demet <0xC5><0x9E>ener, who continued his divorce case with Ibrahim Kutluay, was with his lawyer Asl<0xC4><0xB1> Hatimi and Ni<0xC5><0x9F>anta<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1> the day before.
Shener, who allegedly broke her nose to Edwina Sponza, filed a spiritual compensation lawsuit, and presented the photographs of Sponza and Kutluay together as evidence to the court.
The socially beautiful SpongeBob said, "Demet took my private photos illegally," she said in a criminal statement about <0xC5><0x9E>ener.
“I’m not going to know your name.”
After this last development, <0xC5><0x9E>ener, who met his lawyer in Ni<0xC5><0x9F>anta<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1> Delicatessen, went out of the room when he saw the journalists.
When she recalled Edwina Sponza’s claim to photographs, she laughed, saying, “God, I must have gotten into the house.”
Actually Hatimi de Sponza's complaint "There's such a complaint, but the content is not correct."
He said, "We have everything; we have to go to court."
“Lately, everyone knew about your wife’s relationship with SpongeBob.”
"How did you not know?" he was surprised at the question.
What's that?
How's that?
"I swear I didn't know," said Sheener, "would I believe in my husband who looks into my eyes, or in the saying of my elder brother?"
Before the journalists insisted on asking, "Haven't you ever heard?" Sheer said, "No," she continued, "I haven't heard, of course I heard for the first time."
But I didn't believe in anything like that.
Everything was normal, it was in place; there was nothing I suspected.
Ma'am, I learned everything when you sent everything to me, so I just...
"Was the person who sent the evidence to Sponza?" Shener, who answered "yes" to the question, deeply confused them by claiming that Sponza had sent him the photographs and the letters he presented to the court.
Sponza had previously claimed that his correspondence with Ibrahim Kutluay was mounted.
Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> will sign a contract with Negredo tomorrow
The Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> Club will officially include Spanish footballer Alvaro Negredo tomorrow.
The signing ceremony will be held at Vodafone Park for Negredo, which Besiktas agreed in principle on transfer with the Valencia Club of Spain.
The signing ceremony of the club’s chairman, Fikret Forman, will be held at 12:00.
In the meantime, the Spanish footballer will go through health checks tomorrow morning.
Qatar: We broke the embargo in hours thanks to Turkey
Qatar's Minister of Economy and Commerce, Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani, said he wanted to convey his thanks to the Turkish people.
Al Thani: "Thank you very much for your honest attitude and the support you have given us."
I also send greetings to my brother President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an of the Qatari Emir.
The Qatari economy has proven its resistance.
In many countries, our economy remains stable while the economies are being negatively impacted.
We must work with all our strength to ensure that Qatar is independent and strong.
Thanks to Turkey, we have largely broken the shipment against us within hours.
We don't lack anything at the moment.
The natural resources we have, natural gas exports, are providing a huge support to the economy of Qatar.
Thanks to Turkey, we were not affected by the abusive conduct and against the law.
Today, Qatar continues to produce natural gas and LNG around the world again.
“After what happened, we experienced a 30 percent increase in our natural gas exports, not a drop,” he said.
Al Thani, noting that work on brotherhood relations between Qatar and Turkey continues in all areas, said: "The volume of trade between us was <0x24>554 million in the first quarter."
The decisions made in recent years have also played an important role.
As a result of the fact that Turkish products have also proven themselves in the Qatari market, it is extremely important for us to accelerate the import of goods from Turkey in all sectors, to make investments in many areas.
“Thank you so much for your constructive attitude towards us,” he said.
The cost of the last accident is <0x24>300 million.
TSB President Can Ak<0xC4><0xB1>n <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar found 7,000 reports of damages of TL 116 million to insurance companies after the storm on 18 July, 12 million reports of 800 liras were received in the Gökova quake on 21 July, and the last reports of 800 thousand liras were received, and on 27 July 8 miles were received in Istanbul and 16 miles in the storm on 22 July.
"In terms of cash insurance, the damage caused to the vehicle is 3,500 liras per shell damage, and the glass damage is about 1,000 liras."
"In the earthquake, the average housing damage is 6,000 liras," he said.
Can Ak<0xC4><0xB1>n <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, who stressed that they are making an intensive effort as a sector to compensate for economic losses, said that 3 out of every 4 people have no housing insurance, 1 out of every 2 businesses has no fire insurance, and 2 out of every 3 people have no cash insurance.
Due to the low rate of insurance in our country, the risk of serious damage costs for our citizens and our institutions is increasing every day.
All these costs should not be left to the state.
Insurance policies are not as expensive as it is thought, insurance is not just an industry that pays damage; they also provide risk management advice.
Increasing insurance awareness and insurance coverage is very important for our people and our country.
Can Ak<0xC4><0xB1>n <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar writes, "Insurers should report damages within 5 working days under the general terms of cash insurance, and this period ended yesterday."
"Will the insured be a victim?" he replied, "Even if it is in general terms such a period, the time limit in the Trade Act is two years."
"Also, these events are natural disasters, so insurers don't have to panic, I don't pay any companies," he said.
That's how the German media saw the giant!
During a period of growing turmoil between Turkey and Germany, the German company Siemens has won the first Turkish Wind Energy Renewable Energy Resource Areas (YEKA).
The German media said this development was "German Siemens has won the giant ambition in Turkey."
DWelle Turkish said in a statement that the Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon consortium has won the YEKA initiative, “the consortium will invest more than <0x24>1 billion in wind power plants.”
"The project opened for the creation of a megawatt wind power capacity has the feature of being Turkey's first YEKA project," he said in the news that the number of firms competing in the project has gone from 8 to 2 today, compared to 30 from the Chinese Mingyang and German Siemens consortium.
The Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Berat Albayrak, who made a statement after the report, made striking statements on Turkey-Germany relations.
The result was the German company Siemens, and we can say that this image is an important message to the region and the world.
When we look at Turkey and Germany's 200-year history of cooperation, I think that this result will make an important contribution to Turkey-Germany relations.
No matter how regional crises there may be in the world, I was very proud to show that Turkey is the region and the world’s most reliable investment countries are at the forefront of this ambition.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, meeting a possible contest
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia met for the first time on Thursday for six pounds, crossing the roads to showcasing their most satisfying boxing match in the near future.
Invincible World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia was in separate rooms in the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until he walked through the corridor and greeted World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion Lomachenko.
With a vote on Saturday on Showtime, former four-square world champion Adrien Broner was defeated by Garcia, among the top five of both fighters on the list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champion?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga at 7 p.m. on Saturday night at ESPN.
While posing for photographs, Lomochenko's manager Egis Klimar noted that a potential rival among the fighters would be "perfect in size".
Garcia reminded me, "I'm an old pussy fucker."
“I went up for the Bronner (140 pounds) but I’m not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get a light weight.
He also has to go through a mild pound (135 pounds), then we can fight.
That's what the parties want.
Let's give it to them."
Lomachenko joined.
"You need to fight this fight."
Climate asked whether this should be 'before and watch'; to set a next summer date with Garcia (37-0, 30 nakvt) and to fight Lomachensterko in a 135-pound opening encounter this year, a part of his strategy to fight against Jofilet-Campfeyor's battle with Garcia's 23-pounds-in-a-camp.
Garcia said, “The fight could be ahead and watching because all the supporters want it,” and then which channel offers the best financial package, she stated she was open to him.
We are the main names.
No other name will be of such interest.
Whenever they are ready...”
Garcia Lomachenko said she appreciated him as "a stunning fighter" and could participate in Saturday's match.
But Lomachenko hesitated to praise Garcia in many ways and said that he thought the three-slot champions from Riverside looked "too slow," "Sorry, Mikey ... you wanted the title."
Garcia said it was boxing to show the punch power of the room first.
Both of them said they felt my momentum was created for their own encounters.
“This is a fight to be fought.
Another fight doesn't create so much interest and rumor.
Garcia said, "I'm so happy to deal with this."
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters and that's Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight."
Turkish Rest from Russia to the United States
The White House does not consider the implementation of measures that will affect the construction of Moscow's pipeline, but measures for Russia could increase the cost of these lines.
This is due to the increase in the cost of debt.
The Kremlin, worried that Western investment partners would consider withdrawing from projects due to the construction of pipelines, in return, hastened the construction of pipelines.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which is planning to build the Turkish Stream line from under the Black Sea to Turkey, has accelerated construction at the request of Gazprom.
Reuters wrote that Gazprom also started construction of a second pipeline parallel to the Turkish Stream in order to be able to export more gas to Europe.
The new results of Sweden’s illiteracy age assessment test revealed
In Sweden, the latest results of the evaluation tests of refugees undergoing a new medical age assessment method found that more than 80 percent of the participants were over the age of 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these tests.
The Swedish National Department of Forensic Medicine and Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket)’s age assessment more accurate after criticizing some refugees’ failures to assess their correct age during the inflammatory process.
So far, the Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to test and the Department of Forensic Medicine and Medicine has revealed the outcome of a total of 2481 cases from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
It was not ruled that 80 per cent (2002 age) was 18 or above, and in 25 cases the Forensic Medicine and Drug Administration ruled that the examination was "probably 18 or above."
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was "probably under 18".
Tests were performed only in cases where the person is suspected of age.
According to Johan Göransson from the Department of Forensic Medicine and Medicine, the results are consistent with the past months.
He told The Local, "We don't see a big difference in statistics over the past months, the figures are quite consistent."
The proportion of cases judged to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that refugees are lying about their age.
In May, the apartment explained the outcome of the 581 test and said there were 442 cases where "the subjects were shown to be 18 years of age or older."
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the results of 581 cases, it found that 243 cases were clearly declared to be 18 this year.
The medical age-assessment method, which involves drawing X-rays of 20-year-old teeth and scanning of the knee joints, and then analyzing them to dentists and radiologists, is criticized in some environments.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who evaluates the biological maturity of people whose studies were also on whether they entered the age of invention earlier or later than normal.
“I have reasons to think about it and I don’t think that the type of measurement used should be that.
It's very suspicious to decide on biological life in this way.
If we can’t say for sure, we shouldn’t do that,” he told the Metro newspaper.
What’s more, Göransson of the Department of Forensic Medicine and Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: “You can generally say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small.
The greatest risk is that the person is immediately under the age of 18, in which case the risk is about 10 percent."
Star Hamidiye Camisi opens in worship today
The Star Hamidiye Camisi, built by Abdülhamit in 1885 by architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, will be opened in prayer on Friday after restoration work.
District Director Mürsel Jar<0xC4><0xB1> said that restoration work, which began in June 2013, was completed and ready for the opening of the fireplace.
Yellow gave the following information: "Restoration studies were conducted within 2 scopes."
The first part of the fire was the repair of the main building.
The second part was environmental regulation, too.
In the first part, about <0xC2><0xA3>16 million was spent on environmental regulation, and about <0xC2><0xA3>11 million was spent on environmental regulation.
The bullets of the wooden cube were first opened, after they were renovated, the outer walls, the impurities of the outer influences, were removed from the pastes.
Drainage has been done for the sanitation.
There are very rich decorations as you can see when we get into the room.
It's a work with star motifs, very rich in pencil work.
There's a way of karma here.
"It is also possible to see traces of selchuk, if we think that it was made in the Ottoman and 1885, the Baroque architecture began to become effective as well."
U.S.A.'s ANYTHING
"German Emperor 2 in the middle of the road."
They had partial defects, were refurbished and hanged in place.
It's a really valuable and important piece.
There are wooden cages, which are symmetrically located on both sides of the road.
We know that this was done by Abdulhamit Han, the author of our own self-sacrifice.
So we have knowledge of how he did it himself with his own hands and how he was mounted here.
They are still standing here in the original way.
Yellow said President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was also expected to attend the opening ceremony.
Pantic claim in Göztepe
The Ukrainian press said the 25-year-old Serbian footballer who did not enter the team in Kiev could be rented to a yellow-red club.
The country's soccer team started in Serbia's Red Star team, Pantic, wore the form of Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves in Spain.
Pantic signed Dinamo Kiev in mid-season
West Virginia Governor Says He Will Change Party
West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening that he would change his party at a rally with President Trump.
Governor Justice said, "Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have left me."
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and thoughts... today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can no longer help you as a Democrat Governor."
The meeting was drowning in protests.
Justice added, "So I will change my record tomorrow as a Republican."
"If I were a technical director, I'd say it's time to start a different game."
Mr. Trump promised to make an important announcement at the West Virginia rally earlier.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and did not support Democratic candidate Justice, Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes says that with the coal he inherited from his father, he has coal mines in five states.
Its assets are approximately <0x24>1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Congress issued a statement on Thursday evening, saying, "It is another blow to the Democratic Party, which wants to work to stop it instead of making our country bigger again by changing the state's party."
RNC female spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS, "With only 15 governors and the control of the least number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is only the latest rejection of a party that is headless from scratch and does not find a positive, unifying message."
I will do the best for Turkey.
The third Olympics is Turkey's record.
He was born in Cuba, but F.Garza has chosen Turkey as his own homeland.
In 2013 he became a Turkish citizen and wore a national form...
He was first European champion, then the third Olympics.
Now he is one of Turkey’s most important medal hopes at the World Athletics Championships.
Yasmani Capello, 400 metres behind bars, spoke to SABAH ahead of the championship to begin today.
They didn't want you because they didn't like their degrees in Cuba when they were young.
You've developed your coach's arrest.
Then they called, but this time you didn't go.
Some people think you've chosen Turkey for money.
What do you say?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was my departure from the national team.
From that moment on, I can say that I have drawn a line of events that I have experienced.
Then I came to Turkey at the invitation of the Fenerbahçe club.
The attempt was made by the Fenerbahçe National Team.
They offered me an offer for the supplement.
I opened a new page with Turkey.
I had a lot of disability in my youth, but after the opportunities offered to me in Turkey, I signed on to significant successes in Rio and Amsterdam.
I look forward to doing the best in the World Athletics Championships and gaining a different reputation.
You've been to a press conference lately.
Can you tell us why?
Whenever a question is asked about Turkey’s exit from me, my childhood comes to mind, my 23-year-old is getting kicked out of the Cuban National Team.
And, of course, in Turkey, people approach me.
When I won the gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam, I felt the same thing when I was playing the Istiklal Marge.
I couldn't keep my tears.
I am also very grateful to Turkey for having the opportunity to fulfill my dreams.
I'm so happy to be part of the Turkish national team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You said before that you could be a Turkish lover.
You're with a Turk right now, you went to Cuba together.
Would you like to share what they're experiencing?
The biggest increase in being with a Turkish is peace of mind.
When compared to Cuban women, peace is...
Turkish girls are in a relationship.
Your girlfriend is also an assistant coach.
You've been together all day, for example, confusing your eating?
She eats more sweet than I do.
(Laughter) I don't actually have a very strict diet, but sometimes it's confusing with what I eat.
My coach, Massimo Matrone, is also often on harsh warnings with my diet, but I know it’s for my good.
How does your girlfriend cook you with Turkish dishes?
Turkish women make very nice food, but my girlfriend makes it more beautiful.
(Laughter) Dry bean pepper is my first choice.
HER SADECE WORKS
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He had other young people in my place.
After winning medals on behalf of Turkey, we met in Cuba.
He showed me to the young athletes next to me, looking at my face, and said, "Look, I raised him."
I just laughed at him.
LOOKING ON MY OWN LOOK
The curiosity of the glasses you wear in the race...
I'm just using it for concentration.
When I wear glasses, I cut off my relationship with the world, and I stain the wall on both sides.
I'm just focusing on the finish line and I don't see anything else.
What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you say HEYECANLI TOKYO TOKYO 2020?
Felix Sanchez...
He won the gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics when he was 35 years old with a 400-metre handicap.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at the age of 33, so why not.
TURKCELL PRODUCTS
Turkcell Deputy Director General <0xC4><0xB0>smail All said they believe Yasmani Capello will be successful in London, "We strongly believe that Yasmani will represent our flag in this championship in the best way possible."
We wish all of our athletes the best of luck in London.
"We will continue our support for further development of Turkish athletics and for greater success in our country," he said.
Coe praised Russia’s “honest” apology for the doping scandal
Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised Russia's sincere apology for the doping scandal, but stressed that the time was not right for the country to be re-accepted.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that it is correct to exclude the country from sport and that it is determined to fight doping.
"He apologized to all the athletes who were forced to take gold and silver medals in the competitions," he said.
Despite his assessments, the IAAF Congress voted in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
IAAF President Coe told reporters, “I think today is a very sincere response, a very sincere presentation.”
"All the council and all the congress were pleased ... that the Russian Federation accepted itself, that it had skipped the very tumultuous days, and that it was doing everything possible to ensure the re-establishment of the federation..."
Coe also said that Russia has "me" because it accepts its re-acceptance criteria.
"I think it's a very constructive day and I think it's taken, but Congress supports the proposal that the task force is not the right time for Russia's rights to be restored," Coe said.
“We have to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
Our guiding principle has always been to want to separate clean athletes from the faulty system.”
Nine-nine Russian athletes, who meet the IAAF criteria, will compete impartially at the World Athletics Championships in London, starting Friday.
The head of the IAAF mission, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia has not yet met many criteria for the return of its rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that the drug test was still inadequate and that banned trainers were still working freely.
Lies to US 'Tank to YPG' News
The U.S. Embassy in Ankara said no tanks were given to anyone fighting in Syria.
The claims that hundreds of tanks and guns were sent to the YPG were false.
The embassy's statement, "Explanation of the wrong news in the press about the rubble going to Syria," said:
In a series of inaccurate news reports in the past few days, it has been alleged that the United States sent hundreds of tanks and weapons to Syria to support the YPG.
These reports ignore some of the basic facts about the current situation in Syria.
The U.S. hasn’t given any tanks to any group fighting in Syria.
A large part of the U.S. military aid, primarily made up of light weapons and ammunition, supports elements of the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
The Syrian Arabs, including the SAK, are fighting to clean up the area and re-enter their homes.
TYDTA President Ermut: Direct foreign investment will take place over last year
TYDTA President Arda Ermut said last year’s total investment was 55% after July.
15 July FETO reported that there was no decrease in investments due to the coup attempt, but on the contrary, Ermut said, "Maybe there would have been more increase, he hit the steak."
Perhaps if these conditions did not occur, if there were no regional developments, we could see a further increase with the impact of the impact.
We are more hopeful of it for next year.
Hopefully it will be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
Already in the first 5 months, we are going up 11 percent compared to the first 5 months of last year.
But we don't find it enough.
"We hope that there will be more," he said.
“Global and regional developments, if necessary, do not cause us to worry,” Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Ermut recalled that 75 per cent of direct investments usually came from Europe by 2010, and continued in his words:
That figure fell to 66%.
Asia's share again rose from 2 percent to 7-8 percent.
Russia's share has increased.
While we were trying to do this, there were some problems between the Gulf countries.
Turkey has good relations with all; especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar are two major actors.
But the problem between these two countries is troubling us and thus allows investors to postpone their decisions a little more.
We may be experiencing some delays not only in terms of investments in Turkey, but also because of this.
Arda Ermut recalled that some events were happening about Germany last week, but the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, clearly and accurately reacted to this situation.
Speaking to investors in the countries where the harshest political crisis has been experienced, President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s reaction is, “Look, problems happen between governments, certainly not between peoples.”
Second, these people came and invested in my country.
This is no different from Turkish companies for us.
On the contrary, they will come to us when they have the slightest problem, we will solve it.
"We will definitely not allow them to be victims," Ermut, who claimed to be in his form, said that they continued to support all investors with the convenience of doing so.
Ermut, "We can guarantee that in the next period."
You will see that neither the German companies nor the investors from the countries where we have some political problems in any way will be in trouble.
On the contrary, I hope that we will do our best to increase the investments from these countries.
We think that the investments coming from here will continue to increase.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions about the investment environment.
"But at this point, we will do our best to ensure that both our investors and the perception of the investment environment are not affected," he said.
TYDTA President Ermut said that Turkey began to see great interest from China after a one-generation single-way strategy, but that if the problems in the Gulf were resolved, they expected the biggest investment from the Gulf.
“There is not even one investor in the relationship with Germany who says, ‘We’ve been in trouble because of these relationships, we’ve had investments because of this event, we’re escaping’,” Ermut, who uses his statements, noted that there are companies that come, come and follow.
Ermut said: "Right now, nearly 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies."
That is, almost 10 percent of the companies we meet from all over the world are German companies.
Some of these are companies that are currently investing in Turkey.
He's going to increase his investment or something, and he's still open to us as a project.
“Thus, German companies still make up an important part of our daily workflow,” he said.
Ermut, who stressed that all state agencies should be cautious during the period when perception operations were carried out in Turkey, said that the issue was sensitive and could be affected in the slightest miscommunication.
Ermut, stating that what happened in the past 2-3 weeks was a good lesson, said the following:
Politicians and investors are always different.
We’ve always seen it; economic relations always make it possible for some sort of political development to take place.
“Germany will continue to be our important trading partner and an important investor.
Because there are a lot of investments in Turkey right now.
Unfortunately, this kind of speech increases the electoral agenda in Germany.
As I pass by, I think they'll get a little better.
In particular, Saudi Arabia also warns that the two countries do not make a negative statement.
As a result, an investor who invests in Turkey is investing targeting the entire country’s environmental markets.
So, not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region, there have been some slowing processes.
But our talks with these investors are still ongoing.
My personal view is that investors are waiting for a decision they might be able to make faster right now.
“In a negative sense, I see uncertainty due to the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, I’m leaving here,” he said.
On the contrary, we have Saudi investors who are still living in Turkey, who on the one hand meet with us during their holidays and follow all their processes.
Arda Ermut, recalling that international direct investment (UDY) to Turkey last year was <0x24>12.3 billion, said: “I think we will definitely pass it this year.
"But how long we're going to go, these regional developments, global uncertainties will affect us," he said.
While hoping that the impact would normally be more severe, Ermut pointed out that maybe it could be a little more limited, indicating that the first five months were up 11 percent, indicating that it could be protected, "I hope we can't see a worse year, but the last year, I'll find a better one, and so on.
He informed Ermut that a significant part of the investments made will continue to be real estate, indicating that new investments in logistics, health, fintech, information, petrochemistry, food, energy and manufacturing could be seen.
Ermut, who also stressed that there will be new investments to be announced in the coming months, said, "We may soon have an investment in the sense of manufacturing."
Not a billion dollars, but a big investment.
“Interesting investments can also be made from countries,” he said.
4 wine companies in 9 years: 55 detained
<0xC4><0xB0>stanbul Anti-Smuggling Crimes Branch Management teams have sold the products of 4 wine companies to ensure that the fungus coating is not sold on the bottle by holding the foils long and loose, and that the bandolers are not glued to the bottle, after they are glued to the coating.
The oil teams suggested that the state had a tax loss of <0xC2><0xA3>20,400,000 due to the repeated use of suspects’ gangs.
The police teams organized a simultaneous operation at 55 addresses between the factories and their warehouses in Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirda<0xC4><0x9F>, Bursa, Bal<0xC4><0xB1>kesir, Manisa, Ayd<0xC4><0xB1>n, Marizli and Nev<0xC5><0x9F>ehir.
A total of 55 people were detained in the operation, while 15,000 wines were sold in the searches, 52,480 bottles of wines made with gangrene and many times used gangrene bottles, 12,890 bottles of gangrene, gangrene 100, gangrene 100, gangrene 100, gangrene 100, gangrene 6, gangrene boxes and gangrene
55 people were taken into custody and taken to the Directorate of the Anti-Trafficking Branch, located on the National Street.
Suspects are conducting security operations.
The operation of their teams at their factory, warehouse and workplaces was reflected in police cameras.
Police teams were shown to check on the calls they made at a warehouse by removing the caps on ready-to-sale wine bottles.
Full of bags collected from used bottles were recorded in the police teams review of TAPDK gangrene hoods.
How will football’s financial rules affect Neymar’s going to Paris?
Rules to prevent unlimited spending of European football clubs will not prevent Neymar from transferring Spain's world record from Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint-Germain.
From the prestigious Champions League tournament to Paris Saint-Germain, the governing body that controls the European game, can produce any kind of result.
The Financial Fair Game Rules issued by UEFA in 2011 means that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar has financed the transfer without massive losses.
Barcelona was paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million (<0x24>262 million) to buy just the Brazilian out of contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will find tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some of the financial aspects of Neymar's going to France are as follows:
Taking into account the money from the energy-rich Qatari family, PSG will sign Neymar and of course pay for the money to add him to the galaxy of other stars.
Clubs are allowed to spend money loaded to get the player, but they also have to balance it with their legitimate income resources by registering to get it done in soccer-related matters.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs in pursuit of great debts were actively scamming, and that if banks or their owners were at risk of bankruptcy, they would be able to withdraw their support.
In 2011, the FFP began monitoring losses rather than focusing on club debts.
The change meant Roman Abramovi<0xC4><0x87>'s first model in 2003 at Chelsea (take a potential club, make a high expense to improve the team, and create a global brand) would become a more difficult attempt.
During the three-year FFP evaluation period, which lasted until 2018, clubs could lose <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
Although Platini was disrespectfully removed from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, is still determined to give up without excessive spending.
Andrea Traverso, who runs the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: "The FFP is definitely not dead and we will definitely be strengthened by moving the rules forward."
Even though PSG will pay for Neymar’s purchase as a whole, it can extend the amount to the contract term for accounting reasons.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee can be shown as a cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44.4 million in its annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP events in 2014 saw the application of the heaviest events to Manchester City, which is owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
PSG was then fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (<0x24>82 million for that time) and ordered to limit the Champions League team to normally 25 instead of 21 players for the 2014–15 season.
UEFA is reluctant to oppose clubs that can try to deceive financial regulators by inflating their income through affiliated companies with club owners.
While a Qatari company may be a sponsor of PSG, if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market values, UEFA will not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
In 2014, UEFA ruled that the Qatar Tourism Authority’s PSG sponsorship was inflated.
Part of Neymar’s earnings from PSG have been reported to come through payments by Qatar’s World Cup 2022 organizing committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have lied that Neymar will be the ambassador of the World Cup, and such a move can be easily revealed by UEFA organizers.
The measures applied to PSG in the past mean that UEFA will be even more careful against attempts to skip the rules.
The founders said on Tuesday that UEFA is not in a preliminary meeting with PSG on Neymar's transfer.
Since they were not authorized to speak on the PSG's condition of confidentiality, they spoke to The Associated Press.
The latest estimates show that PSG made more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 with a profit of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>542.4 million.
The financial statements for the past year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to contribute to sponsorship agreements, gift and form sales.
After signing, the club expects the circus to increase by at least 30 percent.
The Spanish league, apparently upset by the departure of one of the biggest players of football, tried to prevent Neymar from leaving with the PSG's claim that he violated the FFP.
La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS that Qatar is the definitive owner of the PSG, "This is an open 'financial doping' case with the club and the state."
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, a member of an American sports club, shares his concerns about La Liga being funded by a state.
Wenger said on Thursday: "This is a result of having, and in the last 15 years it has completely changed the whole terrain of football."
“When a country has a cottage, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial fair play because for a country such a great player can have different methods or different areas of interest to represent a country.
The price of tea from the insurers
According to TSB data, the insurance industry has been damaging in the transport industry since 2006.
In 2015, the sector suffered a loss of TL 2.35 billion, while in 2016, it earned only TL 19 million.
The stock exchange operates at Aksigorta, Anatolian Insurance and Sun Insurance in Istanbul.
<0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, speaking at the first six-month meeting of the TSB in 2017, estimated that the 11-year damage to traffic insurance reached 7.3 billion TL, the damage to the industry was estimated to be 2.3 billion TL this year with the application of the roof premium.
This year, <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, who says the 2015 figure will be captured, notes that the damage in 2012 and 2015 also took the profits of other branches, "This means; by financing the bad driver, we also increase the price of the citizen's housing policy."
“75% of the sector is financed by our foreign partners and in some sense by our partners abroad,” he said.
In the past, he continued:
We don’t expect profits from traffic, but we can’t show that we’ve made profits in the past 11 years.
"We also accept this, but we continue to hope that if we can carry the damage in a reasonable environment, we can carry it with other police officers," he said.
When traffic damage took the profitability of other products, <0xC3><0x87><0xC4><0xB1>lar said that there were dramatic price increases, "in 2012 there were about 30 percent price increases in traffic insurance, in 2015 it almost doubled, and we wrote the biggest damage of our history."
"Even in an environment where prices are so high at the end of 2016, our traffic wife was only <0xC2><0xA3>19 million," he said.
Those who wait for the free tariff to be passed next year say, “We will lower the price of a good driver in the free tariff and apply a high price to a bad driver.”
"But the Treasury is looking at the general approach, the last word about when it will happen," he said.
The Treasury Department has announced that the increase in compulsory traffic insurance premiums since 2015 has affected a broad section of society, and that from April 12 the maximum premium (tariff price) has been applied.
Accordingly, the maximum premiums for each vehicle group related to mandatory traffic insurance policies to be organised were fixed on the basis of mandatory traffic insurance based on year-groups, taking into account the traffic density and accident statistics.
On the other hand, as of July, the application of the "Risk Insurers Pool" for high frequency of damage to the compulsory traffic insurance was put into operation for car groups.
The premiums and damages related to the traffic insurance policies within the pool will be shared between the insurance companies.
These insurers will be identified by the Primitive Treasury Trust.
In the first 6 months of 2017, with the application of the roof premium in traffic, the production of the premium decreased by 11.5 per cent compared to the same period of the previous year, and the number of polices increased by 4.9 per cent to 8.6 million, when inflation was taken into account.
<0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, who said traffic would again take profits in other branches this year, said, "This damage cannot be sustained with these ceiling prices.
How much more can the industry bear this damage?”
<0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, who says that the capital of all companies in the sector is 9 billion TL, only 2.3 billion TL will be completed in three years when traffic is damaged, says, "Foreigners are financing good driver bad drivers, why do I have thousands of turkish stocks?"
"We're trying to tell the Treasury our problem at this point," he said.
Following these developments, <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar asked a question about whether foreigners in the Turkish insurance sector have not come to the point of weight reduction, "They have not yet come to that point."
They expect to invest more in Turkey because in the Netherlands, an average of 6 policies per person fall, while in Turkey it is 1.3.
"Thus Turkey is a place that needs to grow in a real sense," he said, and continued:
So they didn't give up here.
However, while the company is gaining a reasonable profit every year, it uses all of its profits to grow the company.
According to TSB data, premium production in the industry was TL 40.5 billion in 2016, with an increase of TL 23.1 billion by 12 per cent compared to the same period last year.
At the time, the industry predicted that it would not complete the year with a 15 percent growth in total premium production.
News of Social Aid for Thousands of Chronic Patients
Under the direction of the Minister of Family and Social Policy Fatma Bethel Sayan Kaya, who began his work a while ago, the details and implementation of the "New Social Assistance Programme for Families Fighting Chronic Diseases" were identified.
The social assistance programme to be launched for poor citizens and their families will benefit 4,300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients in the first stage.
Patients will be provided with monthly support over two-thirds of the minimum wage, as well as regular psychosocial support.
The ministry will also make an additional payment to patients with tuberculosis who are not able to take medical care, who live their lives on the basis of bed, or the need to improve their home living conditions.
Payments will be made via Social Aid Cards to be provided via PTT.
Geographical conditions, illness, disability, will be paid at the door to those who are unable to withdraw money for reasons such as.
In many ways, the program also has the ability to be the first in the world.
One out of 10 companies to invest is still German
The Prime Minister of Turkey, Arda Ermut, chairman of the Investment Support and Promotion Agency, said that German firms in Turkey are seen as a Turkish firm and that the political tension between the two countries does not reflect the business world.
"In relations with Germany, there is no one investor who says, 'We're running out of trouble because of this situation,'" Ermut said.
Ermut, "Approximately 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies."
Some of them have an investment in Turkey.
“The Germans make up an important part of our daily workflow,” he said.
Ermut said that a partnership of the Abraaj Group’s logistics company with Netlog is a good example of this.
Abraaj Group Partner Omar Syed, pointing out the economic growth in Turkey, said, "We have invested a total of <0x24>1 billion in Turkey."
<0xC3><0x96>zer is about to be the last Ottoman.
It was announced that the experienced footballer, who spent two weeks to find the club, would sign an official contract with Ottomanispor in the coming days.
At the beginning of last season, <0xC3><0x96>zer Hurmac<0xC4><0xB1>, who signed a contract with the green-and-white club until the end of the transfer 4 hours ago in 2019, made a significant contribution to the team with 5 goals 4 assist performance while wearing in 29 leagues, 2 cups.
The manager took the road back to <0xC3><0x96>zer and agreed with Brazilian Sergio Antonio instead of this player yesterday.
The transfer of the century took place!
Barcelona announced that Neymar was transferred to Paris Saint-Germain in exchange for a fee of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million.
Recently, the development of the transfer followed with excitement by the soccer community has been officially announced.
PSG has added <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million, which is the player's free standing cost to the Catalan team for the Brazilian player, to the star name.
Neymar was the most expensive transfer in football history, along with the cost of this bonservis.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has signed a five-year contract with Brazilian star Neymar.
The club's website said that Neymar, the 25-year-old who became the world's most expensive footballer, was awarded <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million at the cost of the bonus service, and that he would sign a form contract at PSG by June 30, 2022.
Speaking after the signing ceremony, Neymar said he was very happy to be wearing the form in the representative of France, "Since I started my football life in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most combative and ambitious teams."
My reason for joining my teammates by coming to this club is to get as many cups as our supporters want.”
PSG will pay Neymar <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 million each season.
Thus, the cost of the star player will cost the representative of France more than 400 million euros.
The strike of seafarers is over.
There was no agreement in the joint agreement between the company <0xC4><0xB0>ZDEN<0xC4><0xB0>Z A.<0xC5><0x9E>. and the Turkish Maritime Union (TDS) in connection with <0xC4><0xB0>ZDEN<0xC4><0xB0>Z A.<0xC5><0x9E>.
In addition to this, the union member <0xC4><0xB0>ZDENIZ workers went on strike on 12 July.
The strike, which lasted nearly a month, ended today at 3:00 p.m. after the workers were hired.
According to the signed collective bargaining agreement, the salary of the civil personnel within <0xC4><0xB0>ZDEN<0xC4><0xB0>Z will be reduced by 12 per cent.
After the registration of <0xC4><0xB0>ZDEN<0xC4><0xB0>Z to the International Ship Sicily renewing its fleet, together with the Income Tax Authority obtained, the salary rate accepted for the personnel in the ship’s status increases by 25 per cent is 5 per cent.
<0xC4><0xB0>ZDENIZ General Directorate announced that the trips in the inner bay will continue at the normal rate, the trips in Yass<0xC4><0xB1>caada will start from Tuesday, and the trips in Foça and Urla will begin at the end of next week.
TDS President Hasan Pekdemir, stating that they are blocking traffic with 23-day strikes, said: "The people of Izmir will relax."
As a result of the strike, improvements were made to the rights of our workers on land and at sea.
We're happy to leave the table.
On average, 28 percent of the people at sea and 20 percent on land will get into their pockets.
We also had friends who worked at the minimum wage level.
We have also made serious improvements in their salary.
Nostalgia niches with "Wet Hot American Writing" and "Comrade Detective"
So, for the bright days of the characters in the '80s, for the grunge period in the '90s (when brains like David Wain and Michael Showalter did the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV) and for himself, for 2001, for the stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd.
As a cultural product, this is both the embellishment and the embellishment of our time with permanent memory of Facebook.
But as a series, it's like time is running out.
The "First Day of the Camp" was unexpectedly successful, and this was not only due to the absurd nature (in it, there was a story about the origins of a box of speaking plants voiced by H. Jon Benjamin.)
By focusing on the main joke (playing abusive children with middle-aged actors) it made it impossible to recapture the part of the joke in the past.
The parody now features a monologue about the less emotionally based and perverse follow-up film of the 90s, “Ten Years After Adults,” which includes a more random monograph.
At one point, the character confuses an Apple Powerbook, some single-row wheeled patins, and "many other things since 1991."
Most of the main stories are the same.
Soft-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter) is a writer who still hasn’t forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) hasn't lost his virginity yet.
There’s also another crazy treacherous plan in which Ronald Reagan (meaning Mr. Showalter) is confused, now haunted by George H. W. Bush (a very well-seated imitation of Michael Ian Black).
The best part of the series, as usual, is the words.
It's so nice to see Matt Dillon's always young Mr. Rudd, who has six lip belly buttons in "Single" in particular, that his, Andy, the old school's most popular kid, now looks like a moruk.
It could be random moments of insanity that give this series power (for example, a kind of "Seven Up!" series repeating) until it reaches what I thought was the logical result: "White Hot American Writing: Twenty Years Later" that makes it possible to see the last scene of it.
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" refers to a different type of nostalgia in the Amazon: "The Americans"' Cold War revival, the film "The Bomb of the Storm" and even the iconography of "GLOW" against the East, West struggle.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy directed by Rhys Thomas appears to be found on TV: a 1980s Romanian police friends drama in which two Bucharest police officers struggled for real, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The lead roles are played by wolf Gregor and idealist Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Ulici, and their dialogues are dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (who is also the lead producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a very bright idea.
But that's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice visual jokes (Americans spend time watching chess on TV while watching football)
The famous vocal artist staff, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny, is a good material for the "sex who knows" game.
But "Comrade Detective" calls himself so much so that a hoaxed propaganda drama can be reminiscent of the reality that (including a killer wearing Reagan's mask) he plays mostly just like him.
Six long episodes can't pass and comedy isn't fast enough or often enough.
Gregor and Joseph were constantly visiting the American Embassy, where two fat men ate a pile of hamburgers like always hungry wolves in the lobby, while "Comrade Detective" could have been better served by propaganda if shortened to a narrower length.
The message of the fantasy communist watch is that Western culture can transform anything into food to defeat in series.
The Romanian creators are not wrong: We do this to our own recent past and even to their own.
The father of the women's
The British government has seen our family as deadly and self-sacrificing as a result of fifty years of experience.
The supreme authorities of the government have since acknowledged that this family has been deeply attached to the British Government and is in great service.
It is necessary that the British Government be wise and cautious about this ransom, which he has made with his own hands, carefully investigates and examines everything and decides carefully.
While trying to understand the FET<0xC3><0x96>, the starting point is the organization of the Hashashis, but a forgettable difference is that the FET<0xC3><0x96> is an organization that emerged in the imperialist era and moves with colonialism.
In this case, the 'first move' to be addressed is the women's movement.
In English praise in Greek, the person who described himself as "the ransom by the British government's hands" is Mirza Gulam Ahmet Kadiyânî, the founder of Feminism.
Gulam Ahmed, a small town in the Indian state of Pencap, said: "On December 1, 1888, God ordered his followers to obey him and set up a separate congregation."
In 1891, Gulam Ahmed said that according to his revelations and inspirations, Jesus died of a natural death like the other messengers, and that God sent him as the Messiah and the Messiah whom Christians and Muslims await.
The Muslims are the same as the Muslims, and this is Mirza Gulam Ahmed Kadiyâni.
(Islamic Encyclopedia, VAT)
In India, who was completely under British control after the 1857 religious uprising, Gulam Ahmed wrote books defending Muslims under persecution against Hindus and Christians, who were believed to have been founded with entirely consecrated falsehoods, but who later emerged in the Commodore religion of the CIA.
Like Gülen, Gulam Ahmed’s most beloved idea to the imperialists is that the “cihad” is a struggle that the Muslim only struggles with his own soul, and that if you can live his religion freely, there is no dimension of imperialism to be fought.
If you even remember, laughing one step further, even in the summer of last year, even the Crusades, whose wound in our history is still open, boasted: "It is not very dangerous for the Crusade to invade your country.
There are red lines between you and them.
Once they're done, they're not going to meet your wife, your daughter.
They don't join the mob, they don't join the crusaders!
The idea that mehdi and christianity are united in themselves, the idea that their congregation will be the savior of Islam, as the concept of jihad means only to fight philanthropy, along with the similarity of the phenomena with the FETO, the spread of femininity is generally taught in general and in reality.
The total number of women’s centres in the world in 1869 is said to have exceeded 2 million, and the number of countries officially registered by the emergency agency Humanity First in 1869 is 23.
In addition, 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensers in 55 countries, 8 nurseries in Africa alone; 505 educational institutions in 11 countries and around 16,000 nurses worldwide are among the data.
The Nobel Prize-winning "first Muslim scientist" Prof. Abdüsselam, chairman of the United Nations Justice Division, Sir Zaferullah Han, "first Muslim actor" Mahershala Ali, who received the Oscars, is more likely to be a woman.
Let us note that the meeting of women in England with 30,000 people last week has also been polished as a show in a body.
One of their slogans is a brief look at their history to understand what women who say “love everyone, hate nobody” actually mean “love your settlers/colonialists”.
It is possible to continue the starting point and motivation of such activities as Hülasa, FET<0xC3><0x96> or Tahir-ul Kadri to women, and all of these organizations are in fact given a pass to imperialism and are supported as a foundation to empower societies in order to serve colonialism.
The "last wish" came out of the cargo
Emily Pomeranz, 50, who spent her last days at a hospital in Washington, D.C., complained about the lack of coffee and chocolate mixed milkshakes at a restaurant in her hometown.
A friend of hers contacted the owner of a restaurant called Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who has run the same restaurant for 47 years, put on dry ice to drink and also sent a <0x24>123 (435 TL) fee to the hospital with a "fast delivery" freight over 600 kilometres away.
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul
To date, Ahmet Kul <0xC3><0x8D>n<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x81>at has launched important projects such as Lavinya Park, Otoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, Dia Mare in Mimaroba in Istanbul and Solse 7 projects in Bodrum Yalikavak.
The geometry of the Dia Mare project developed by the Architecture of <0xC3><0x87>amo<0xC4><0x9F>lu Architecture was developed to take full advantage of the sea.
Located on an area of 11,000 square meters, Dia Mare houses a total of 188 homes and 17 commercial units.
The complete construction project will begin to be delivered to new owners in March 2018.
Dia Mare has a large number of apartment types ranging from 2<0x2B>1 to 5<0x2B>1.
The company, which will launch two new plants in Mimaroba and Bitez this year, is preparing to sign two major projects in Topkap<0xC4><0xB1> in 2018.
It has transferred 753 million to its subsidiaries.
Peace Partners said that many programs were carried out at TRT, where 6,760 staff were employed, and that air fares were paid.
The representative of CHP, "TRT 2016", again levied the national taxes to AKP companies."
"It's called a robbery," he said.
The source transferred by TRT to the adjacent manufacturing companies was revealed by the data obtained from official documents.
The official response to the application made by the <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul Members of the Peace Association within the framework of the Information Recognition Act was clear as to how the resources of TRT were spent.
In TRT, where 6,760 people are employed as staff, the company said that despite all technical possibilities, TL 753 million was transferred to related companies in 2016 through programs under the name of external production.
The CHP spokesman used the phrase, "This is emphasized."
Peace Friends, "AKP journalists and their businessmen's production companies are actually plundering TRT."
"Millions are being paid for unreported or unreported productions," he said.
Recalling that the money transferred to the companies was collected from the public taxes, Yarkama<0xC5><0x9F> said, "the institution, which has 7,000 staff, has returned to the AKP's estate."
"What programs did these companies sign that 7,000 people couldn't do, and they got that money?" he said.
TRT stated that advertising revenue in 2016 was TL 224,456,182 when Friends, staff salaries and other expenses were taken into account that advertising revenue remained in the balance.
"TRT, which became the voice of the AKP, does not receive advertising because it is not being watched."
Feeding journalists are taking money from TRT, smuggling in the name of the AKP.
He said, “The burden is on the people.”
CHP's partner continued: "TRT pays <0x24>660 million annually to staff; but it gives all of its jobs to external productions."
753.5 trillion people have been withdrawn from TRT, which means that they have been withdrawn from their pockets.
This is dubious.
She quit committing suicide, kneeling in front of her husband and apologizing.
The incident took place today at noon in a parking lot in Eyüpo<0xC4><0x9F>lu Mahallesi D<0xC4><0xB1>rmen Street.
According to the information obtained, the surrounding residents who saw the citizen hanging down from the 4th floor of the car park reported the condition to the fire and health teams.
While the firefighting teams were opening the door to the area where the incident took place, the health teams were also waiting.
The three-year-old father, Yunus G., who quit suicide after nearly an hour of convincing efforts to the psychologist and police teams called to the scene, apologized to N.G., his wife who watched him in tears.
On the other hand, Yunus G’s suicide bomber, on the street, watched as about 100 people were sitting in the elevators, while some citizens registered with their cell phones.

Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25 percent
Soon after the Bank of England’s speculation that slow economic growth and moving inflation will be a rise, it is expected that interest rates will not change.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue "slowly" as family incomes fell, as they kept their interest rates stable.
The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decision-makers voted 6 to 2 votes to keep interest rates at 0.25 percent, so they wanted less membership this month after weakening support for slow economic growth.
In its three-month inflation report, the Bank warned growth forecasts were down to 1.7% in 2017, to 1.6% in 2018, and that household incomes would continue to decline as inflation is expected to rise to close to 3% in the spring.
However, interest rate increases have given a sign that it is necessary to regulate Brexit’s inflation in the next few years and that debt costs could remain higher than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the massive economic recovery package launched a year ago after Brexit.
The bank said it would end its Removal Funding Plan, which offers cheap financing to banks from next February, but expects to offer <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion more (<0xC2><0xA3>115 billion in total) within the framework of the plan.
Minutes after the interest rate decision was taken, the bank said: "The MPC's central estimate is that the real domestic net income (GSYH) continues to slow as real domestic income declines continue to burden consumption in the short term."
Regarding interest rates, he stressed that "a reduction in monetary policy may be necessary to mitigate inflation and that the market would be "a bit higher" than expected.
Markets are still predicting that the first increase will be in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stresses that any increase will be "step by step" and "limited".
According to the May projections, the bank's decreased growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The bank maintains its estimate of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterlin, after the news, lost value against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 percent to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 percent to 1.11 euros.
The decision to change came after lightening the expectations of the recent growth figures, which were disappointing with GDP being 0.2 per cent in the previous three months, compared to 0.3 per cent in the second quarter.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but the bank says it will start to show a slight increase towards the end of the year.
While the bank says the downturn will get even worse before it improves, the latest inflation report leaves little to be enjoyed by households affected by rising inflation and wallet wage increases.
The bank said monetary policy could “not be adjusted” for revenues in the next few years, but expected “significantly” improvements towards the end of three-year wage forecasts.
As a result of the weak pound, the increase in demand for British goods will support the economy by balancing some of its declining consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the EU referendum, which took the pound down, down to 0.25 per cent in August.
The bank expects that it will likely take four years to fully impact prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank’s latest interest rate decision, inflationary pressure on the Zordani households increased and demands for an interest rate increase that rose to 0.5 per cent in July with the call of the three policy makers.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in July to 2.6% last month, but the bank said it expected this and would grow again in the coming months.
According to their 2% targets, the bank said it was "totally" impoverished pounds.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent declines in borrowing rates, when lenders have a positive demand to do business and close the year, the mortgage market will once again become even more competitive.
Sunday; in re-hypothecities, it looks good to know for those who are nearing the end of their existing contracts, becoming more popular than ever with many free options and low interest rates.”
NHS to Write Controversial HIV Drug to 10,000 People
In the High Court, after a struggle with the drug's funding at the NHS, patients will be able to access HIV prevention treatment as of September.
The NHS UK has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pre-sex pill that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals, will be provided by up to 10,000 people through an estimated 3 years of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) trial.
The Supreme Court's decision last year agreed to fund the experiment following the presence of the Court of Appeal. The decision, despite the claims of the NHS to fund local authorities, stated that it had the power to make payments for PrEP.
The move, announced on Thursday, was welcomed by NHS UK President Simon Stevens as "a new and serious intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "point of departure".
The population of sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first registered clinics, with the participation of more clinics fully implemented across the UK by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a series of HIV medications that reduce the risk of getting HIV before sex.
The trials showed that PrEP significantly reduced HIV transmission among those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that a person has enough drugs to prevent the spread of HIV infection in the body.
These medications can be taken every day or two hours before having sex.
Those who are eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexual people, and HIV-positive partners who cannot be successfully treated.
Clinics will identify suitable participants who will be satisfied with the trial from men, women, transgender individuals, and partners who have HIV conditions controlled by an antiretroviral treatment.
Those who live in the UK and are registered with a practitioner will also be able to register for potential participation in the participating local sexual health clinics.
The program will hold <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and the NHS has signed an agreement this week to provide medicines with a bid to UK nations.
The trial was designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how PrEP is targeted, carried out and implemented on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: "This new and serious intervention will contribute to broadly and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in my thirty-year development to undermine one of humanity’s major health problems.”
Deborah Gold, president of the National AIDS Trust, said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If the right target is targeted for those in need and those at risk, PrEP offers the possibility of converting the HIV outbreak in the UK.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will reach a new and powerful vehicle that is truly private to the person and not open to negotiations with a spouse through this NHS-funded experiment in the UK, which will lead to the recovery of many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, chairman of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The first thing to do right now is to make sure that the experiment is delivered quickly across the country and that no one at risk for HIV is left behind.
As the PrEP experimental drug is now provided, we are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.”
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Public Health Minister, said: "We welcome the PrEP experiment has begun and the months of delays and then the government's retreat has been delayed.
Evidence shows how this drug can be transformative as part of our view of preventing HIV and how life-changing it can be at the end of the infection.
The experiment will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this experiment be presented across the country as soon as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.

Two Secrets of Death
Former Minister of Industry and Commerce Ayhan <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu's daughter <0xC3><0x9C>mit Makbule <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu (51), born in Washington, lost her life by falling below the 19th floor of a business centre used as a hotel in Istanbul Levent.
A 24-year-old student at Koç University, Melis Saliho<0xC4><0x9F>lu, was found dead at his home.
Saliho<0xC4><0x9F>lu's self-defense was pushed forward.
The investigation into the two deaths, which followed and were considered suicide by the police, was launched.
“Depression has been lost.”
Turkey's first Minister of Industry and Commerce, Ayhan <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who served in the Nihat Erim government in 1971, entered the Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler at 5 p.m. on August 1, 1966, with his daughter <0xC3><0x9C>mit Makbule <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, born in Washington.
An ambulance and police team were called instead of informing the hotel management of a Kuwaiti tourist who saw <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu's dead body, who had not been informed of him for a while, in a room on the 19th floor.
The health team found that <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who fell from the 19th floor to the hard floor, lost his life.
Mediha <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, the mother of the police, said, "There has been a depressing state lately."
On July 31, he arrived in Istanbul from Ankara.
I have a grandson with leukemia from my other daughter.
"This was taking care of my granddaughter and was adversely affected by my granddaughter's disease," she said.
The funeral of Chilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who was removed from the Forensic Medical Agency, is expected to be buried in Ankara.
It's been investigated whether <0xC4><0x8C>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu was thrown by someone or committed suicide.
"CANINA KIYA" IDEAS
The other suspected death in Istanbul was in Sar<0xC4><0xB1>yer Zekeriyaköy.
Melis Saliho<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who studied at Koç University, was found dead in his 24-year-old home.
The young girl's father allegedly went to her daughter's home near school, where she had no news and had no access to her cell phone.
Dad met the dead body of his daughter at home.
Her family was moved forward by taking her own life in the house of Melis, loved by her closest neighbours and friends.
Melis Saliho<0xC4><0x9F>lu's death engulfed his family and loved ones.
After Melis, a friend of mine said on social media, "A sparkle was hitting our face with a sparkle of sunlight."

Living a luxurious life: The suspended floor and smart design numbers have turned this small Earls Courts apartment into a holiday home.
Former banker Joanne Leigh, a real estate refurbishment passion, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
Proof of a new design that convinces Joanne to pick up her luggage on the first floor of a Queen Anne showcase.
"Before this, I lived with my ex-girlfriend in a much larger area in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.
“I was looking for something like my price.
The apartment at Earl Court was shown to me and they had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with him and made an offer that day.”
After the first sight, the 1,000-square-foot apartment was renovated from scratch.
Initially a single-room property with a complex plan; you had to pass through the kitchen to reach the bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a hanging floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows and a lot of light.
That was my condition,” he said.
To this end, the Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio kept Erfan Azadi from Duck & Shed to take advantage of the 12.5 ft ceiling and to create not only a structure but also a place where Joanne would live.
The ceiling was not tall enough to add two areas on top, so the architectural difficulty was to create a hanging layer within which you could stand.
He had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steel skeleton is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to set the gaps so that they could accumulate on each other without the need to be tilted down.
It wasn’t just to build a simple platform, the steels would be so inclined that they would be at the right height according to the function above or below.”
This arrangement, bringing many additional dramas, made it possible for Erfan to get two full-size rooms on top of each other.
An old type of copper light window taken from Retrouvius for the hanging floor looks at the magnificent living area below.
Mirror-coloured furniture, silver accents and the old type of Serge Mouille lighting all define the style of the design.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding space, space, and light.
Mirrors placed on both ends of the short corridor make it look longer.
The mirrored protective panel in the kitchen gives the feeling of a window opening into another room.
Mirror units at the entrance provide Joanne's entire blade blade kit and storage space.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a more wonderful sense of space, is to be able to close the kitchen when it is not in use.
Opening and closing kitchens are not new.
What is unique is that there is a garage-style door that can be lifted up.
Erfan explains the steel-reinforced MDF door, "We used a lot of engineering in it."
"It's a balanced weight, so when you push the door up, it's really easy to slip."
With the smart use of the space and storage space, Joanne has gained an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved sitting plan.
“At the end of the day, it’s something you’ll sell the sitting area, or the value of your property is determined,” Erfan says.
"As a fraud, a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation on the basis of the lounge area."
Here they managed to use high-quality materials that give the area a luxurious look while increasing the floor area.
Erfan says, "Materials are the objects you touch and thus help you build emotional bonds at home."
"You won't fall in love with the power lines on the wall.
These are important, but they don’t vibrate the wires of your heart.”
This is proof that through good design and increased square meters an apartment can turn from something standard to something quite wonderful.
Actually, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
Jeremain Lens in Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>
At the end of the 1.5-month talks, Lens transferred to Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> with a lease voucher.
After a week of intensive talks, Lens agreed with the Black-and-White team at a cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 million in bonservis.
The Dutch player, who has signed a five-year deal, is expected to receive 2.2 million euros a year.
Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> is expected to make an official statement on the transfer of Jeremain Lens.
Wedding photos of famous couples
For about 4 years, the man who had been in a landing-out relationship with the actor and singer Emre Altu<0xC4><0x9F> entered the world home at Sortie.
The couple immortalized the wedding ceremony with photographs they called "the most special memory of our lives."
The couple decided to divorce seven years later.
Brothers Fight for <0x24>500 Million Property Empire
The two brothers, forty years after the dynasty of their Italian families, are at war for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than <0x24>500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and entrepreneur Colin De Lutis lives three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who gives himself to the Supreme Court about how to share property and business assets in a property in Toorak.
Paul had wanted to quit family work since 2014, but the Supreme Court continued to hold tough disputes over the split.
With her mother Anna, the brothers Smith Street, they own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars accumulated since a store they bought in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and raised it to a chain with 160 retail outlets.
It was sold for <0x24>85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in the property, and De Lutis’ portfolio currently includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento entrepreneurship fields, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments and shopping malls in the suburbs.
Within the framework of an agreement with his deceased fathers, Colin (described by Paul as "a significant driving force and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family) has two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul has one-third.
A court file says this means Colin owns <0x24>316 million, while Paul owns <0x24>176 million in property.
For Paul, sharing property and cash appears to be a controversial issue.
In his first oath to the court in 2015, he wrote: "The divisions proposed by Colin left him with the properties that I have always attributed to him as the best."
Last Friday, the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held after many failures of mediation.
The brothers are also fighting over who will control the current business; Paul claims Colin has left him out of the business.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.
Colin, in a sworn statement he made at the outset, says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian roots dictate to me that family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer have registered hundreds of pages of sworn statements, emails, and the best lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and senior legal advisers held by both sides, with the case rising.
Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi had been an Italian migrant family since the late 1950s and had bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Colin had hostaged his goods to buy the Collingwood property, where his family opened the first coat pants store.
Colin says he founded Westco there "in my last few years, when Paul was a little boy (10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hope to leave their belongings to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that she never wanted her brothers to go to court," she wrote.
The other two brothers Mark and Luke are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; when Colin leaves the job, Mark was paid <0x24>10 million, and Luke was paid <0x24>26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the terms of their financial dividends."
According to Eddi McGuire's 2015 biography, best friend of the television star, Colin tried not to pay attention to a former AFL club board member.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Just because Colin was in court with a brief message, he replied, "I can't say too much."
"It's very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and bring our family's name to court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin had written that in a court application, he was trying to meet his brother’s demands.
"Our father, Paul and I would not want us to fall into an existing disagreement," he said, adding that he was still hopeful about the solution.
This hope seems to be lost on Friday.
Colin wrote, "Our issue will be resolved by the courts in the near future."
Trump’s new private pen plans to restrict the president’s media diet.
The others tried and failed, too.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do that.
If that's the case, it'll be the first.
Politico says the new White House special pen will restrict the flow of information to President Trump (including media reports) in the hope of keeping his boss more stable.
Some little information from reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When the White House’s new private pen meets with senior staff on the first day of John F. Kelly’s work, President Donald Trump summarized a fundamental problem that President Donald Trump was planning to solve about the White House: the passing of bad news into the president’s hands.
Kelly told the staff that information should flow through it, whether on paper or with briefings, because the president would be able to make better decisions when good information is given.
Kelly’s diagnosis makes a lot of sense, but others tried to manipulate Trump by checking the media diet, and they failed.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades, and he’s still in good condition at the White House.
A former campaign adviser, Sam Nunberg, told Politico in February, “It would be rewarding to show him that he has found a fair place in the media if he is not fairly involved in the media.”
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time, “According to six campaign officials, the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control was to ensure that personal media consumption contains a steady stream of praise.”
All right.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit is “under control” at any time is ridiculous.
Perhaps this campaign staff knows something the rest of us don’t know, for example, that Trump’s tweets would be much more provocative without their own interference.
We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump hasn’t sent.
If the elements were able to get him out of danger a few times, then it was worth the effort.
But no one was able to stop Trump from constantly creating controversy.
Part of the problem was that the White House was made up of rival rivals, i.e., trying to advance with the materials they offered Trump on their agenda (they could be reliable or unreliable) and people who promoted their own world views.
In May, throughout this story, Politico reported that consultants were strategically inclined to convey suspicious information to the president.
One example that journalist Shane Goldmacher described in detail was this:
"Existing and former Trump officials say that Trump has reacted sharply to negative coupons from the press, especially leaks that have a bad effect, and find out where they come from.
At the end of February, the president of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson's GotNews.com website was accused of giving a printed copy of an article accusing Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
It didn’t matter if Johnson was legitimately banned from Twitter because of harassment, or if he didn’t provide any substantive evidence, or if he had previously filed and returned from them.
Trump read the article and started asking questions about Walsh with staff.
Goldmacher added that the then private pen Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter were trying to "manage and implement a system that would document the documents Trump received."
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same thing after three months.
Perhaps he will emerge as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still in his own mood and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These immutable factors will make Kelly's job a lot harder.
Crypto FET<0xC3><0x96>"supposed with a special template
Prosecutor of the Republic of Izmir, Berkant Karakaya, is the secretary-in-chief of the Chief of Staff of the Navy Command of the Command of the Commander of the Commander-in-Chief of the "Complex Code" in the investigation of the seizure of certain information in the "military espionage investigation."
In the review, it was stressed that contrary to the fact that the Admiral Yayc<0xC4><0xB1> was not an organizational figure, he helped the investigative staff in the Naval Command in deciphering the members of the crypto organization and played an active role in the fight against FETO.
In a decision pointed out that in the coup attempt of Yayc<0xC4><0xB1> on July 15, under the so-called strict command of the Navy Command, he attempted to be pacified by order, from the very first day in which Yayc<0xC4><0xB1>'s coup attempt was initiated, he took an active fight against FETO.
In Karakaya’s decision of non-tracking, the following statements were used: “Thanks to the cryptocurrency, a special template for the detection of FET<0xC3><0x96> members belonging to the private services class, and to 209 sub-criteria with 64 basic criteria.”
The fact that a special and rebellious act has been observed in judicial investigations is that it is an active anti-terrorist organization that is the result of an active anti-terrorism organization, and this is largely known as the fact that there is no evidence of the non-confessive testimony of a non-confessive witness.
The All-Admiral Yayc<0xC4><0xB1> had previously been convicted of insulting.
It turns out that there are FET<0xC3><0x96>s behind it again and that the alleged crime is a bump.

Passengers crossed the gap, returned to their 'rich neighborhood'
Some of the West Midlands’ richest homeowners are struggling again with diligent travelers who have been pierced by the council to take back the area outside their storehouses.
The passengers parked their 20 caravans outside an area known as the ‘rich neighborhood’, which is the street in Solihull’s time zone.
They returned from the trench that the council dug to cut down their flows, bringing the babies and a full truck with them, just after they were fired in May.
The intelligently moving group found a gap in the defense, leaking their vehicles inside by setting up a road from a section left barricadeless.
Angry residents criticized the Solihull Council, saying it was "useless in solving the problem."
An anonymous resident said, "After Bentley Heath sent stones to the passers-by, they arrived there on Monday night.
The council should be ashamed of their moves because they are useless in solving the problem.
Travellers were there in May, they were sent, and now they are back.
“There’s more to come last night, probably more to come today.”
He added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this with long-distance decisions taken to protect its parks.
I live in Streetsbrook, and I’m not happy to continue paying my taxes while the council can’t even stop it.”
A resident of a region that didn’t want to name it said, “As a joke, we saw the last group of travelers have just left, and we were destroyed by a new group.
The number had increased this time, and even a horse was seen grazing in the park.”
A spokeswoman for the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unauthorized camp on Streetsbrook Street, and we are initiating the legal proceedings necessary to send them out of there as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that the county resident calls 101 as many as possible to report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police.
This will help us in bringing our case to court so that the court can take into account the picture of the situation.”
Galatasaray announced that Ndiaye
According to the announcement of Galatasaray Sportif Xinai and Commercial Investments sent from A<0xC5><0x9E> to the Stock Exchange in Istanbul and placed on the Public Illumination Platform, the yellow-red club, in the case of the Otmanl<0xC4><0xB1>spor for the price of the soccer bonservis 7 million 500 thousand euros, in the case of 7 million euros, and in the case of more than 25 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>, in the case of the club, in the yellow-red club.
Galatasaray will also pay a total of 11 million euros of guarantee to Ndiaye, who has signed a four-year contract for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,750,000 a year.
In addition, Ndiaye will be awarded 5,000 euros for each point that the yellow-red team will receive in the matches they play in the TFF Super League and UEFA competitions.
In the statement, it was also announced that the player had a unilateral right to terminate the contract for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million as of June 15, 2019.
Last day's battle!
They've flown to the fire stations.
Thousands of vehicles were damaged by the storm and flooding that took place last Thursday in Istanbul.
While most of the drivers reported from the fire to receive damages by insurance companies, drivers who have not received the report to date also entered the line for the report.
Drivers who were not not notified today were asked for a report by arriving at the fire stations due to the fact that the notification period was the last day.
Today's Last Day
Drivers first took pictures of their vehicles to detect damage to their vehicles to firefighters.
Drivers who detected damage to their vehicles later reported to the officers.
Hasan Erol, who came to the fire station for the report, said, "I have registered and I will take a photo."
When I got there, there was intensity.
"There was damage to the front window," he said.
The driver, Erbil Sword, said, "We're on the run."
We're in line.
We took the photo.
"Now we're going to wait for the report," he said.
The skyscrapers with the sea and land walls can't breathe
A member of the CHP’s Rare Ataman, a member of the House of Representatives, noted in an earthquake warning about giant structures rising on the coast: “The Davadaki scholarly report clearly states that these structures will not withstand the magnitude of seis.”
It is stated that the rocks where the solid rock is 25-30 meters below are not so deep.
<0xC4><0xB0>stanbul Ataköy’s high-story hotel and residences covered the walls between the sea and the black coast have left the district breathless.
The Member of Parliament of Bak<0xC4><0xB1>rköy Municipality of CHP Radir Ataman, a giant AVM, hotel and residential projects that rose after one in the district.
Attention to the wind of the coastal structures, Ataman said, "80 years ago, those who planned the wind had formed the Atatürk Forest for Florya.
Eighty years later, how the concept of urbanism was reached, the giant skyscrapers in their wind corridors changed the climate.
"You can't breathe in the country," he said.
Ataman, who said that buildings erected on the Ataköy coast like a wall changed the climate balance, continued: "The temperature is 10 degrees higher because of the skyscrapers."
These buildings need to be made according to the direction of the winds.
But our skyscrapers are rising above the wind corridors of Istanbul.
The wind is not entering the district.
These structures disrupt the natural balance of life.
Ataman said that these skyscrapers, which harm the environment and human health, would also cut off the connection of the Bak<0xC4><0xB1>rköy people with the sea, and would appeal to the Council of Monuments on the matter and go to justice.
Unsurgical treatment is possible when hair returns.
In the case of phenol application, success is seen to be greater than 83%.
In this method, the diseased tissue is effectively cleaned and the tissue cavity is filled with an agent that kills hair roots.
One of the techniques of treatment for non-surgical hair rotation is the laser method.
With a variety of lasers, the hair roots and the surrounding tissue are burned by circulating rays, which ensures that the tissues are closed by sticking during this combustion.
Thanks to these two non-surgical methods of hair restoration, patients can return to their social and business lives in a shorter time.
Dr. Mert Atak says that overweight, immobile life, sitting for a long time, doing business, not complying with the rules of hair hygiene with dense hair and body hair, has discomfort such as pain, infection, abscess and swelling in the throat, among the symptoms of the disease.
Italy Strengthens approach of STKs to migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned the STKs operating the migrant rescue boat in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue if they fail to comply with the new rules affecting their operations.
Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Torino newspaper La Stampa, "It will be hard to see if the STKs do not comply with the new arrangement, they continue to operate."
Minniti's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat operated by the German aid agency Jugend Rettet, with suspicion that it was actively cooperating with human smugglers to facilitate illegal migration of its crew.
The aid agency, which has only been active for a year, refused to comment on the content of detailed allegations directed against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
The organization said in a statement on social media: "For us, saving human life is our most important priority and it will be, so we are very sorry that we are not able to work in the search and rescue area right now."
"But only after we have collected all the information and have been able to evaluate the situation can we evaluate the current allegations that are being made."
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Iuventa boat of the Jugend Rettet since October.
It is suspected that the crew took a boat full of tyre boots directly delivered to them by human smugglers and allowed the smugglers to escape to be reused with boats.
According to the prosecutor’s records, at least one such meeting took place at the 1.3 mile point of the Libyan coast.
The crew is under the auspices of the Italian coastal security authority, which is responsible for rescue operations in the region due to a very humanitarian effort for another purpose.
According to rumors, there should have been an Italian police officer on the deck of ships like Iuventa, who clearly monitored their activities.
Only three of the nine STKs in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the ban: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Tuesday that the new rules were considered unnecessary but acceptable because there would be no “serious change or interference” in their own rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign the Nobel Prize are Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said the sharp decline in the number of migrants coming to Italy following rescues in recent weeks was a sign of efforts to strengthen Libya’s coastal security and fruitful cooperation with local governors.
The minister said: "Lately, we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel."
This month, Libyan governments announced plans to hold more talks on economic development initiatives and to take measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe with Chad, Niger and Mali.
Last-minute punch!
In Moscow, Russia's capital, carp won vodka, as it happens every year in the celebration of the "Day of Parachute Units".
Russian NTV TV reporter Nikita Razvozjayev, who broadcasts live in a Russian Gorki Park, participated in the event and was overly alcoholic.
In the live broadcast, the reporter, who reported the developments of the day, immediately said, “We are going to conquer Ukraine,” and the man who shouted, “Please shut up.”
The drunken man, who was mentioned to be the former paratrooper, gave him a hard punch on the reporter’s warning.
The reporter, who was appalled by the wrist stroke he had received, tried to get away from the man.
Millions of people watched the shock moment on live broadcast.

Karaeminogols, stating that the 'complete open-ended bladder surgery' that minimizes the risk today also allows patients to reduce their cravings about the surgery with experimental methods: it is possible to get rid of bladder disease in 45 minutes
Although the results are quite good compared to open surgery with microscopic surgery, some complications such as a long recovery period after surgery, constipation in the spine, recurrence of the fever, and further development of lumbar slipping and infection can be met.
Microscopic surgery is often referred to as 'capular surgery', but microscopic surgery is also applied with the same approach as open surgery.
In the case of a fully enclosed bladder surgery, these risks are eliminated because environmental tissues are protected.
The operation of a fully enclosed bladder takes only 45 minutes.

Michelle Carter has been sentenced for messages encouraging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will be sentenced to 15 months behind bars and five years of evacuation.
In June, Carter was convicted of the murder of Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.
Mr. Roy's father said in Thursday's trial: "My family is broken.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until his way of innocence was clear.
Although Azami faced a 20-year sentence, his own legal team had argued that both he and Mr. Roy suffered from mental illness.
Carter, wearing a red pants and a cream-colored blouse, was imprisoned with old eyes, his hands shaved and his eyes looking down.
The prosecutor told the court, "His actions killed Conrad Roy."
He put an end to his life to heal his own.
He did not accept responsibility.”
"He didn't show any remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was a terrible situation that you were completely sorry for."
What is more, Judge Lawrence Moniz said, was that he did not see "any significant impact on the actions of age, maturity, or even mental illness."
Lynn Roy's mother, a prosecutor of Mr. Roy, read a statement: "There's not a day I won't cry for the loss of my beloved son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I've overcome everything, and I'm trying to be with her sisters with all the pain that we're going to endure forever."
Mr. Roy's sister Camdyn Roy said that his brother would never be able to attend the wedding, or that the reality of his children would never be "unforgettable".
"It's always been a pain for me for the rest of my life that the person you've been with hasn't been since I was born."
Looks like a lawsuit will be filed because there's no Massachusetts law that criminalizes telling a person to commit suicide.
Mr. Roy was 17 when Carter was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.
The case was of national interest when it emerged that Carter's brief messages encouraged him to end his own life.
When she was on vacation with her family, the girl said in many messages she sent two weeks before her death, "There are many ways I don't know."
He wrote in the moments before his suicide, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "All you have to do is open the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz, instructing him not to be allowed to withdraw from this case through the press, said Carter wanted to attract attention through Mr. Roy's death.
The case divided the legal opinions.
Amanda Knox was found guilty of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007, two years before she was revealed among the minority who defended Carter.
Ms. Knox, 30, posted an article in the Los Angeles Times that said: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail."
Mehmet Shimshek's impressive growth forecast
<0xC5><0xA0>im<0xC5><0xA1>ek said in a statement that inflation in Turkey should be based on low single-digit figures and that food inflation is a “risk area”.
The Deputy Prime Minister predicts that inflation will fall below 7 percent in 2018.
In his speech, he said:
Critical for the next 12 months to reduce uncertainty.
The biggest incentive is to reduce uncertainties.
There is a strong government.
There is no political uncertainty.
I hope that the uncertainties in our near geography will be reduced.
With a number of reforms, I believe that by increasing our resistance to shocks, we will put Turkey in a growth trend of over 5%.
I told you months ago.
The worst is left behind.
Slowly, reforms that will not bring our energy to those areas, but to inclusive growth, to increase employment...
That's why the next 12 months are critical.
On the one hand, there is no political uncertainty, where uncertainties are reduced.
Hopefully, our chances will be reduced by the difficulties in our near geography.
Even if we don’t want to, many of our classic markets have collapsed.
Like Libya and Iraq.
We don’t just lose on Sunday, we’re facing a wave of more than 3.5 million migrants.
When we look at the last 15 years, Turkey has grown by 5.7% despite all these shocks.
Turkey, that is, we have solid problems with our foundations.
Now, with a number of reforms, we will increase our resistance to shocks and increase the question marks on investors’ heads, and we will again sit on Turkey’s growth policy of over 5%.
Let me be honest, we have such a generous retirement system.
I think it would be reasonable to say that our retirement companies weren't working hard enough.
Once in the car, the performance will be strong.
Why?
'Cause we took care.
Companies don’t have to go out and spend money.
By overseeing these concerns, taking into account that performance is weak, we have robbed in the way in which areas of investment we will allocate global assets.
You know, the yields are high.
There will be a performance there, in addition to the 25 percent that the state gives clearly.
The rest of the money is also at risk, and there is usually a low risk.
When we look at the big picture, I think your interest will increase in the coming period.
Because they'll see the performance.
There is no failure in the other field, there is success.
We restructured BES in 2013.
I have 6.8 million participants, I have a accumulation of <0xC2><0xA3>70 billion.
The system has been successful.
There are also 2.6 million participants in the automatic participation, and I have an accumulation of 775 million liras.
We want some more effort from the companies.
Let them do some advertising, let them tell you about this system.
We're working during the harvest.
Maybe if we slow her down a little...
We'll see, we're working.
Maybe the citizens see the bring, they see the accumulation, and they stay in the system.
38 per cent of those who come out of the system.
Almost half of those who are retired are volunteers.
You don't want two individual retirement accounts.
What are you doing?
You're out of the car.
We were actually waiting for a drop of about 10 percent.
That means we're very optimistic.
Once the system works.
We brought a prime roof.
The insurance companies sometimes explain it unilaterally.
They raised their premiums very quickly.
When we asked what was going on, they said they didn’t take into account the current rules.
We've just made a clear arrangement.
We told you to do the same.
They said no, we wait for the judgement.
We said it wasn't like that.
We have a difference of opinion here.
Of course, when this roof premium application was introduced, some companies refused.
We've made a new arrangement.
Risk insurers built a pool.
I'll say it, I'll say it again.
I’d prefer this system to work by competing.
So I don't find these ceiling pricing apps right, they forced us to leave.
I'd like to look at this three-dimensional event.
Take into account the system we have.
Two, the system runs normal, that's a price tag.
In addition, heavy loads go to tax cuts of almost <0xC2><0xA3>30-31 for every <0xC2><0xA3>100 premium paid.
I'm working on it right now, and we'll talk to our finance minister.
Thirdly, technology is evolving rapidly.
In the meantime, traffic accidents will also decrease significantly.
But that's compulsory traffic insurance.
SABAH's mantle saved his leg
Buerger's disease, which has occurred since adolescence, was an inconvenience previously seen in men, but nowadays it has often started to be seen in women as well.
One of these women is 36-year-old Mehtap.
The pain that started two years ago was chronic on the sole of the foot.
When the young woman, forced to walk, faced the risk of losing her leg, she went to the hospital.
A friend suggested Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
The manuscript in SABAH showed the news "saving the life of the Azerbaijani Minister of Extraordinary Halls".
It turns out that Dursun, who went to Kalko, was struggling with Buerger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko took the young woman for emergency surgery.
Soon after, Stopsun, who was relieved of his pain, is now receiving oxygen treatment.
Audi 850,000 Diesel Vehicles Will Be Modified While Car Manufacturers Are Opposed to Reverse Tightness
A day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of the BMW board said BMW's headquarters (thought to ban or restrict diesel vehicles) included Munich, referring to European cities, that the company believes "there are more smart options than driving restrictions."
Daimler said on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be modified to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies described these moves as recalling.
European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But the nitrogen oxides released by diesel engines are called cancerous and can cause throbbing.
The cost of equipment needed to neutralize the dirty smoke produced by diesel vehicles by automotive companies also increases, making it difficult for cars to remain competitive.
While German automakers were facing reviews, Chancellor Angela Merkel was also accused of smuggling powerful automotive companies and ignoring the issue.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which has relaxed it under normal driving conditions, while a car is being tested and hiding it using a device known as a deceptive device.
Many Volkswagen drivers have been charged in the U.S. and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in the engine development department of Audi, the former president of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and therefore not protected against criminal return and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn to a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to get rid of emissions rules in Europe, expanding the U.S.-based investigation.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could be difficult for Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer has an overwhelming stake in Volkswagen’s profits.
Do not skip everything you see
Prof. Dr. Yusuf <0xC5><0x9E><0xC4><0xB1>kru <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, President of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association, warned that he should not skip fishing to places that are less than 2 meters wide, which are not guaranteed in depth.
Every year, thousands of people are at risk of stroke due to fracture of the neck and spinal cord due to drowning in rough slopes.
Neck fractures most often develop on the 5th or 6th vertebrae.
The feature of the fractures is that it affects the nerves that feed the muscles of the arm and leg at this level.
Prof. Dr. <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar said, "In these types of accidents, the neck spine, which is our most precious organ, is cut by the broken spine or is defunct by compressing it."
“Wrong first aid in housing injuries can lead to death, not only by increasing the damage in accidents,” he said.
Diving in the water is the fourth place in spinal injuries.
The average age of the injured is 20-29 and the majority are male.
Prof. Dr. <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, "Do not jump into the unseen water."
"No matter how well you dive, you can have a serious injury," he said.
Prof. Dr. <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar also recalled the following:
Depending on the level of vertebrality in the place where the damage that leads to injury during fishing, a swelling of the arms and legs can occur to varying degrees.
You may know how to swim, but the water can be deceptive.
The place that seems deep to you may be narrow.
In the U.S. and Australia, the warning plates placed on the coasts of the sea have seen a 70 percent reduction in cases of crude fishing.
Prof. Dr. <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, "Despite 28 years of coastline in Turkey, unfortunately, there is not even a single warning sign in places outside Istanbul."
“Each summer of each summer, the health management, schools and social awareness projects on the coasts and in the pools, or information panels, should be brought to the attention of the public about these types of accidents,” he said.
Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, chairman of the Group of Spinal and Peripheral Nervous Surgery of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association, recommended that in the event of injury:
At the time of the incident, the first job should be 112.
The neck should be kept as stable as possible, not to be moved, and should be detected with a hard fist.
The airway should be provided and the patient should be placed on the opposite side for drainage of water leaking to the lungs.
It should not be held from its legs to drain the water.
The patient's neck shape disorder should not be attempted to be corrected.
The neck may have broken backs.
However, if the spine has not yet been damaged, an inappropriate position to be given to the neck during the first aid and the patient’s movement may cause the broken bone parts to press on the spine and cut off damage.
Provence lavender is under threat of climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is under threat of climate change.
Lavanta is declining due to drought-like conditions and disease-bearing insects, causing a huge headache for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution to this.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agriculture research institute CRIEPPAM, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively under threat because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that brings rainfall, much less in the spring and mostly in the autumn.
This affects the life of the lavender.
There is also a small Augustinian insect with a leaf pest that transmits microbacterial bacteria, and there are many of them in very dry weather.”
And a lot of things are in danger.
As much perfume and cosmetics as it attracts vacationers, lavender oil is being pursued.
Eric Chaisse said, “While some large flowers need to have very long plant heads, we have smaller, less developed, or no-one, or weaker heads.
So we have less essential oils.”
Considered solutions include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but there is also a protective balm and water mixture for plants to spray and develop more resistant species under dry conditions.
Journalist Murder Draws the Gold of the Growing Threat in Mexico
The weekly newspaper Riodoce's staff often meets on Wednesday to review the latest clashes in Sinaloa, the state of Sinaloa, to review plans to include dirty officials and unending drug wars in the newspaper.
But on this day, they came together in the shadow of their own tragedies to discuss their security.
They were told that it was important to change their routine.
Two senior journalists see what makes them feel safer: whether to bring their children with them to the office aimed at a hand bomb in 2009 or leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the black board in front of the room: hamsters, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column; no evidence is needed, perceptions and inner voices are enough.
Suspected journalists of drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, the government, or cartels are the bad guy who puts a list full of Mexico’s chaos in the papers.
There are no signs of violence, as the number of dead bodies increases across the country, more journalists: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 people have been killed since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; at least 589 have died in this federal sub-year after the attacks and threats.
Among the last deceased are directors of writing and inspirational sources of Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
Valdez writes, "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," in one of many books on drug violence.
His absence is felt deeply, but his presence is everywhere, with a large photo of Valdez's middle finger hanging on the front of Riodoce's building with the word "Justice" on it; two journalists in his 30's, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, who took him and smiled at him.
Work takes place two months before her death; reporters talk about common traumas, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a private federal prosecutor was set up to deal with journalist cases in 2010, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, he only fired two of them.
Every year, as in most murders involving drug smuggling and organised crime, journalists’ killers are rarely brought before the law.
In Riodoce; although their hearts are broken, they insist on calling for violence in Sinaloa, even though the ground is now more deceptive.
“Without knowing about the murderers, without justice, it’s very hard to talk to security,” Ibarra said.
"It's stupid to spend my time at this job," he says.
"Unless we know why, you don't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state capital.
The red Toyota Corolla could only take a few blocks before it was stopped by two men; it was forced out of the vehicle and shot 12 times, for the name of the newspaper, which was estimated to be translated as the Twelfth River.
The gunman stepped out of his car and hit the car nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left his wife and two adult children.
In Culiacan, they tend to move freely.
But there is almost nothing but silence about Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his return to the United States in January, rival groups have struggled to fill the void, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields.
In Sinaloa, let one or more people be shot and killed every day, or the cemetery’s stylish, two-story drug kings are full of bigger mozos than many houses to live in.
For a minute, forget that only a single cartel has the status of "discontinued" checking its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the U.S..
Despite being deeply aware of the dangers of Valdez's work, Riodoce's founding partner and manager, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, was convicted of failing to protect his friend.
He believes the two mistakes contributed to the murder.
The first was an interview with the leader of one of the rival cartel groups, Damaso Lopez, who was at war with Guzman’s sons in February.
This article may have angered the sons; the prospective gang members bought every copy of the print outlet undistributed into newspaper bays.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after being handed over to another newspaper in which the same story was published.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his execution was seen as a turning point in the Mexican-led violence against journalists.
He had survived for a very long time, and his friends and colleagues had assumed that he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroeste in 2013 when Riodoce was involved in selling <0x24>50 shares in the show to his five colleagues.
"It was impossible to do journalism in Sinaloa without addressing the drug issue," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper gained fame with its bold and honest news, and advertising increased with sales.
Reporters liked to publish life-threatening research without fear of censorship, and the readers also got caught up in a publication where they could read stories that no one could dare to tell.
Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for journalism in Latin America eight years after its founding.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Prize of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage to stop the pursuit of resistance wherever Mexico’s drug history is based.
She clearly admitted to being frightened.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to continue to live."
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a way of life."
"As a journalist, you have to accept the assignment that falls to you, either that or you play stupid.
I don't want her to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what happened?'"
Riodoce's staff misses Valdez; his fellows who are generous in their jokes, in their cunning and in their advice, in their teachers who know how to survive...
They trusted his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He would go to a bar called El Guayabo in front of the office and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Has his love for routines collapsed?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions as to how they would best do their job and survive.
“If you’re dealing with their wives, their children, their clean jobs, the secret airplane tracks they use to transport drugs, they don’t like it.”
Bojorquez said, "These things were crossing the border."
The result was a high degree of immunity and self-protection, even at the best times.
Trusting your own instincts.
If it smells bad, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, Riodoce's director of writing, said, "It's a smell that can be deceiving... and what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules in Sinaloa do not apply; the same as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and a toxic mixture of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and other government officials that host...
The ground is constantly changing.
Riodoce personnel are not allowed to use any cell phones in the room they meet for security training; days ago, it turned out that spyware sold only to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two police officers outside wanted to get rid of a temperature of 104 degrees (40 centigrades) in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to protect Riodoce's office in a four-storey building in Culiacan's middle-class neighborhood.
Half serious, some of the reporters were wondering if the governor himself was a policeman within 50 percent of them who said these officers were not reliable.
Reporters have gone to the mountainous rural cuts, which drug gangs control as a philanthropist.
In this week’s issue, Riodoce has three main stories.
Former great boxer Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was murdered in Sinaloa.
Also, there was a revelation of government spending concentrated on the governor's homeland.
And a block away from the prosecution, there was the kidnapping of a group at Culiacan's most expensive restaurant.
There was no official explanation of who was kidnapped or how he was, so when the time came to write that everyone in the city knew it was the guardian: the restaurant was the favorite of both drug smugglers and authorities.
A reporter learned from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, the Corporate Revolutionary Party (PRI), which governed almost every academy of politics of the last century.
Recently, many PRI governors have been accused of sexual misconduct.
Villareal, the journalist, asked him to write about events that had occurred before, including the escape of one of Guzmán's sons from a soldier's barracks on the scene.
Only months ago, they were reading, looking at Valdez's corner for the best source of information about the kidnapping.
Due to its thin structure, "El Flaco" laminated Villareal (46), "We already knew what was going on first."
"All of our communication channels with our sources have now been cut off."
Staff are re-used as a warehouse for what they never expected, transforming into activists on behalf of the press, while Valdez’s office is re-used as a banknote and a warehouse for protesting journalistic murders.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez picked up several postcards and showed up in the local prosecutor’s office for another journalist the next morning.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in Michoacán, in the west.
She found a burnt body, and according to DNA tests, official officials say it was him.
Throughout the country, journalists have voiced their thoughts louder by writing "help to the press" on elevators and buildings in organized protests.
Today, Director Bojorquez is trying to provide international support for justice in the Valdez case in Washington.
In a meeting with the Sinaloa governor on the morning of Valdez's death, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling them the truth.
After that day, he asked for another assignment from the government to do the news, thinking that his anger was blinding his impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "circled" by organised crime, co-criminal officials and a disinterested community.
In his last book, “Drug Journalism,” he wrote that journalists were killed not only by drug gangs, but by orders of politicians and security forces who cooperated with organised crime.
Media observer group Articulo 19 linked half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and officials.
Ramirez said, "You're going to die in Mexico because they want to silence you."
The murders clearly had a cold shower effect.
No one remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
The body was found along with a note signed by the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my news."
A computer keyboard and headphones are serialized next to his broken head.
In the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the assassination of journalist Miroslava Breach in March, some publications such as El Norte chose to close.
After their directors were murdered in 2004, the others continued, as did El Manana from Nuevo Laredo.
In 2010, with the headline on the front page of the Diario de Ciudad Juarez, he called to the drug cartels: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their own states, even the country.
This is a decision.
It's hard to find a job in exile, and they're still on the streets waiting for danger.
Sometimes, three months after fleeing Veracruz, four women were captured in 2015, as was apparently the photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was massacred in an apartment in Mexico City.
A dance made every day with these high-risk decisions for those who stay behind and continue to work.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says he was frightened to report drug trafficking.
“Mexico is going to hell and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
On a recent Saturday night, at midnight, Riodoce was making preparations to finish the last number, while managers of summer jobs were sitting in the elevator outside the office drinking beer, while simultaneously playing phones.
A series of armed conflicts involving rival gangs and security forces near Mazatlan, a resort on the coast, have resulted in 19 confirmed deaths.
As promised in a series of cartel messages in the vicinity, the war continued to ravage.
They put the news on Riodoce's website via mobile phones at the elevator.
The front page would be changed the next day.
The sirens began to pass nearby, and there's a battle with another weapon in the vicinity.
Bojorquez quickly checked to see if the police officers were on patrol.
If they were afraid, they wouldn't show.
Under the gigantic portrait of the founders of his newspapers, his middle finger was being displayed to see the whole of Sinaloa, the frame of Riodoce following his footprints.
"How can you think of the cover," said Bojorquez, "when the day that Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him out to inform me on the street?"
He used camouflage to avoid dinosaurs enemies.
It looks like a statue at first glance, but it's a terrible one.
The researchers now explained that the first findings of an incredible creature in the size of a giant found by a Canadian miner are very well preserved, experts have described it as ‘the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.’
It was so well preserved that they could understand that money was reddish-brown, and they could say that it was a ‘difficult history’.
A report in the journal Current Biology described it as "one of the best preserved armored dinosaurs and the best dinosaur species in the world."
Fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosor that lived 110 million to 112 million years ago from the middle of the Cretaceous Period.
The incredibly well-preserved condition surprised the researchers who described it as ‘very wonderful’.
The plant-eating armored is the best-preserved fossil of its kind, according to National Geographic reports.
She was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, crashing the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
According to the rock around him, he hit something that looked strange and decided to look more closely.
The excavated fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Over the next six years, they spent 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of land discovering the wild animal.
After such a hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature was exhibited, said, "If you shorten your eyes a little, you can almost believe you're asleep."
“As one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur species in science history, it will pass as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.”
The researchers, examining the skin, found that although it was coated with roughness and a walking tank resembling this plant, it was likely to face a serious threat from the meat-eating dinosaurs.
He used red and white camouflage to hide from dinosaur predators that were heavily armored, and used a protective technique known as counter-covering, which many of today’s animals also use.
Experts suggest that it is hunted by larger dinosaurs, allowing it to better blend in with the surroundings and skip their enemies.
The creature, from the 110-million-year-old nodozor family, first appeared in manuscripts in May and is currently exhibited at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The researchers have now completed their study and have given Markitchel's name to museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of the teams that spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it.
The species’ exceptional preservation made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists to document the shape and armor on the body with the design of the money.
They discovered the countershadow, which is a common method of defense in the animal world and means that the upper part of the creature is darker at the bottom.
Although counter-shading is common, the findings are surprising because the size of the Borealopella outweighs much the counter-shading animals that are alive today.
This means that the dinosaur is sufficiently pressured and hunted by the meat-eating dinosaurs, and that evolution wants to face concealment as a method of survival.
But the most modern animals that use counter-shadows (such as zebras, zebras, or armadillos) are much smaller and explain much more to be a hunting; which means that this nodozor encountered a serious difficulty in surviving.
Brown said, "The vast, powerful hunting of a heavily armored animal shows how dangerous dinosaur predators in Crete can be."
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the dinosaur also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur is reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about life, including preserved gut content, to find out what it ate at the last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur dies, it falls into a river and drags it into the sea, there it sinks to the surface of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as hot as southern Florida today, and it was probably spread to much more areas than rivers and oceans are now.
"The nodozor is completely coated and protected with cash leather, and it's really worth noting that the original shape of the animal is also protected in 3D," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today, just as it looked in the early Cretaceous period.
You don’t need too much imagination to rebuild it; if you shorten your eyes a little, you can almost believe you’re asleep.”
Cretaceous was the time when the giant teropods, the ober dinosaurs standing on two feet, were wandering around the Earth.
Although all of them were king, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armored dinosaur Borealopella, which might have been hunted by a team of famous ancestors.
Among these is the Acrocanthosaurus, a monster weighing 6 tons and measuring 38 ft (11.5 m) in length.
Scientists in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopella was dragged into the sea after his death and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, crashing the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, the best preserved armoured dinosaur, including leather and armor, is perfect from the hip to the nose.
The creature is on average about 18 ft. (five meters) and weighs up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
It has two 20-inch lengths of your neck that come out of your shoulders.
Scientists believe this armored grass has been flowing around the western Canadian area until it is dragged into the open sea by a river.
But the dinosaur's undersea tomb was preserved in great detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular species are so well preserved that the leather pieces still cover the entire layers of armor along the skull of the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, it's as rare to win a reserve "to this degree."
The more I look at it, the more incredible it becomes.
Fossilized leather pieces still cover the full-fledged armor layers that are pointed at the skull of the dinosaur.
His right front leg is lying next to him, his five fingers leaned upwards.
I can count the money on the base."
Don't get out of your teeth when I'm white.
White teeth and an aesthetic smile are the dreams of every person.
While people are applying a variety of ways to whiten their teeth, the head of the Oral Laser Applications Association, Nükheth Berk, warns that they should stay away from products sold in the market or on the internet.
According to Nikhet Berk, that these types of substances sold are painted on the surface of the mine, the teeth are colored in such a way that they will not be recycled again, "smallly glued to the surface of the teeth with the chemicals applied by dentists, or with the porcelain porcelain that can be glued to the surface of the teeth."
Berk, who notes that protecting dental health prevents the formation of many diseases, shares the following information as it is important for mental health by providing both dental and gum health and a nice smile:
Unless there is a disorder or genetic factors in the structure of the teeth, the teeth of adolescents are usually white.
Due to aging, tooth decay, and the frequent consumption of smoking, abrasive or dark-coloured beverages, teeth become darker over the years.
Tooth whitening can be provided with chemicals applied by dentists, or with thin porcelain surfaces, such as attachment nails, applied without minimal or any wear on the surface of the teeth.
Teeth should never be bleached with products sold in the market or on the internet.
Because these substances paint the surface of the mine, the teeth are colored so that they will not be recycled again.
Ketchioren Municipality has been providing "Home Dental and Oral Health Service" to elderly, disabled and bedridden citizens since 2011.
65-year-old Köksal Güngör, who has been imprisoned for 24 years in Ketchioren’s Awakening District, said: “My wife has been informed of this service of Ketchioren Municipality.”
We called the city, they came right away.
"I don't miss my dental care at all, thanks to this service," he said.
Kezban Gökçe, the daughter of 95-year-old Gülizar Ta<0xC5><0x9F>c<0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who lives in P<0xC4><0xB1>narba<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>, said: "My mother has been living in bed for 7.5 years.
When I arrived in the city hall, I saw the posters of this service and immediately called.
We have been receiving this service regularly for 4 years.
I have a problem with my teeth, and when doctors come, they look at me.
He used the phrase "we're very happy."
There is also no need for any health insurance for a service that is completely free.
The "successful" incident in the Turkish army
Dear readers, very interesting decisions were made, especially with regard to the Naval Forces, at the meeting of the Supreme Military Council (HRC) held the previous day.
It was brought to the command of this Force, not an oramiral, but a coramiral.
It is an unprecedented practice in our army.
So how did this happen?
The Commander-in-Chief of the Force, Oramiral Bülent Bostano<0xC4><0x9F>lu, has completed his term, would have already retired...
And it did.
Now the command line came to Veysel Kösele, the only oramiral.
Veysel Pasha, who had been the victim of the skull and was in custody for a while, had to be in command in the normal rank of leader.
But the government did not want him.
I'm trying to tell you in a nutshell, if we start from the top of the navy, commanders 1, 3, 4 and 5 weren't promoted.
In this case, there is only one Oramiral in the Navy.
The vacant post was to be brought to him: Naval Commander No. 2 Oramiral Veysel Kösele.
So what happened afterwards?
In sixth place, Coroner Adnan <0xC3><0x96>zbal was appointed to that position by the government.
Now look at this painting!
The Oramiral Veysel Kösele is standing there, but instead, he's appointed a lower-ranking commander!
It's a leader who's in charge of your leadership.
What will happen after this?
An oramiral who is superior to the Knights cannot do any of his duties at the command of a guard general who is unfathomable to him.
He doesn't take orders, he doesn't take orders.
In this case, Veysel Kösele will not tolerate this injurious situation, unless he is retired he will resign today or tomorrow.
This is the injurious message that the government has already given to him: "Goodbye to Veysel Pasha!"
Yesterday afternoon when I wrote this article, news of his resignation had spread, but the situation had not yet been formally explained.
Now let's look at this again!
The government has therefore opposed Veysel Kösele, refused, forced him to resign, and replaced him with a 6th-ranked defensive officer, who has defied the traditional concept of our army's "Cydem".
There is politics in the business, and we don’t know the back of the curtain.
Maybe soon someone will tell us, we'll all learn together!
Dear readers, I have tried to tell you very briefly above, especially in the Turkish army, the incident of leadership is very important.
It's not just rhythm.
For example, the officer who finishes the Harp School at number 10 is more senior than the officer who finishes at number 11.
The promoter of the first rank to generality is more prominent than the promoter of the second rank.
We have seen some examples of this incident in Istiklal Harbin.
Garp Front Commander Ismet Pasha...
There are two armies in your name.
Army and 2nd Army.
We arrived in 1922, and our armies carried out a great massacre and expelled the Greek army.
At this stage, there are valuable names that are expected to be assigned to the military commander.
One of them said, "Peace be upon you."
He's being offered military command, but he says, "Impossible is my authority, I can't enter his command."
Another name is Yakub Shevki Pasha.
Professor at Atatürk's Harp Academy...
He is a very beloved and respected commander, who he refers to as "the master," who has been involved in various wars.
In 1919, he was captured by soldiers and civilian Turkish lights and driven to Malta by the British.
When he returns, he is reluctant to command the army, and he says the same thing: "The commander of the Western front is incomparable from me, I cannot command him."
But Atatürk pleases him and accepts the command of one of our two armies, Yakub Shevki Pasha.
The third is a very colorful name...
Ali <0xC4><0xB0>hsan (Sabis) Pasha.
He's a highly-talked, constantly criticizing soldier.
A commander who has fought in Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran and various fronts.
He is also exiled by the British to Malta, fleeing from there and arriving in Ankara via the citadel.
When the army commander was offered to him, Ali <0xC4><0xB0>hsan Pasha said the same thing: "I cannot fight at the command of Ismet, who is without me."
But he's convinced...
But let's see, after starting the mission, he is constantly arguing with the commander of the Garp Front, Ismet Pasha, who is in charge of which he is constantly discussing, bringing the event out and disturbing the army...
And shortly before our great day, he is taken from office and sent to retirement, replacing the scalloped Nurettin Pasha.
Then Ali <0xC4><0xB0>hsan’s pass is never corrected between Atatürk and the Atatürk.
The problem of leadership in the Turkish army is highlighted not only in war but also in peace.
Of course he needs to come out.
Veysel Kösele is the last example of this.
How did an activist find out the answer to the question "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
One day after he came to New York City to travel, he sat on the Airbnb bed that St. Louis's native rented and started browsing Facebook on his phone.
It's like someone's share from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still sleeping on the street," he said.
He was surprised to see that no one else shared this information in the content stream, shutting down Facebook and unlocking Twitter.
A user named <0x40>TheePharoah was continuously retweeted in his content stream.
The rapper from the St. Louis area tweeted Michael Brown's death live at the age of 18, who was killed by an unarmed black, white police officer in Ferguson Missouri.
He shared a photo of Brown's dead body on the street for four hours.
Ferrell thought to himself, "This is wild."
But death was not new to him or to society.
He left his phone later that night on Canfield Drive to go back to tweets about people gathering.
There were photos of a man who claimed to be Brown’s father, who wrote police tapes, yelling people, and a banner of “Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!”
A police officer watched a live broadcast in front of a group of protesters with a toy dog.
In another video, another policeman, as he said, set up the trigger of the rifle and shouted, "I'll kill you all... animals."
Ferrell recalled saying, "This is not usual."
"This is not a murder of the kind and character we are used to."
And then I felt horrified.
I was angry and I was crying.”
He got a ticket and went home the next day.
He took his six-year-old daughter from his father's house at 11 p.m. and decided to go with him to Ferguson the next morning.
Ferrell and Ferguson will see what happened in the next three years on August 11th, the subject of a new documentary entitled Who's Streets?.
This is a story about the perspective of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance of people living in that society and filling the streets with answers they seek.
Ferrell, wearing a floral dress and driving her car to Ferguson with her daughter with a suitable crown, returned to talk about "the experiences of the blacks and the situations of the blacks that they had made earlier in the morning."
"Do you remember what I taught you, black people to fight for what they believe?" he said.
“We’re going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn’t true.
“I couldn’t stop him,” Ferrell said later.
"What happened here today is a result of what happened in the past.
He must know, see, and grow in it.
Not only should we not develop well in the field of activism and organization, but we must also know what we need to do to know the layers of black experience and the black situation and liberation, to liberate ourselves.
If I were lucky enough for her to have an experience that she would not personally experience brutal racism, there would be no difference from any black woman-child.
I have the feeling that by protecting him from these, I will do him evil.”
When they arrived at Ferguson, their first stop was on the South Florissant Road, where they waited to talk about the subject, which was facing the police station, and which resulted in no later charges against Officer Darren Wilson, returning to a kind of camp for activists.
There Ferrell and his daughter contacted local business owners who prepared packaged food.
They prepared the bags and helped deliver them to the protesters.
Slowly a new kind of activism was being formed for Ferrell.
While a student at Missouri State University, Minority Students was the president of the Association of Nurses, and said that in the black community, he focused on food justice and health injustice, "My mobility completely changed after August 9."
“I had no experience in organizing.
It came on its own."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, on an evening show.
Folayan said he and his own filmmaker Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "get the hell out of it."
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can use?"
This suspicion was often reported by countless people, including whites; to come to a society and take advantage of its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson could not be concentrated, and we decided to do it differently."
Folayan was already in contact with Damon Davis, a local co-director who is known for his actions on prisoners sentenced to death.
His involvement warmed up Ferrell to the project, watching it in the years after Brown was shot, as well as the other six district residents, as well as the "Who's Streets?" team.
David said, “It is not a documentary that someone speaks for us or speaks to us; it is we who speak.”
"That's what's important to me, because that's how I'm going to represent these people."
Folayan, "While not focusing on the experiences of Amaç Ferrell, demonstrated that the movement was "not about a mess leader, but about society coming together," proved that the film's participants were the most deficient, he spoke in the form.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" astonishingly documents the personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as being in love and marrying his wife.
When Ferrell laughed at the first sight of the finished product, he said, "I felt naked."
“But while doing this and humanizing black people, I realized that there could be a certain amount of sensitivity.”
Ferrell’s story also consolidates the role of black gay women in the Black Lives Matter movement and re-establishes it.
Two of the three founders of the movement, <0x23>BlackLivesMatter, described themselves as homosexual after the killing of black youth Trayvon Martin in 2012.
"Black gay women in leadership have generally kept the movement up," said Ferrell, "and this is because we are constantly at war on many fronts.
“Black gay women have to carry all the weight of this.”
Folaian added: "The movement is really being held up by black women and many gay black women."
Yet Ferrell insists, "when this is nothing in the kind of positive action" and when his own identities are therefore not chosen.
She says, "He was the one who activated this energy."
“But it’s no coincidence that she’s in the front row, because as a black gay woman, there’s so much that you’ll lose by living a life at these intersections.
You can feel the energy from the screen.”
In Ferguson, the news cameras are already gone, but there are worrying racial connections between the police and the community.
Ferrell is under surveillance for another 2.5 years due to the closure of the highway during a show.
The socio-political atmosphere in the area I call my home is defined in a single word as "small".
Still, Ferguson keeps the song he digs into his memory exactly three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Winning is our job.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
Kyrie Irving: The world is not round!
Irving told NBC Sports, "The world is not round."
The world is flat.
They're used to scaring people like that.
Oh, man, not too much question.
Because the more information you solve, the more information you get out of it.
That's crazy.
Is the world straight?
Or does it revolve around itself in a circular way?
I think you should investigate this.
I'm telling you, they're lying to us.
They're lying to us! he used his words.
Irving said, "I've believed that I wanted to believe for years."
I thought the world was round and round.
Do you really think we're back in the solar system?
Nothing they've sent is coming back.
He's not coming back!
The information they give us is very inconsistent.
The truth is here.
All you have to do is look for the truth.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?" he said.
Kyrie Irving, who claims the world is flat, is battling the Cleveland Cavaliers this season with an average of 24.4 points and 5.9 assists.
An Artist Uses Chelsea Manning’s DNA to Create Portraits
There are many faces in the middle of the room at the New York Fridman Gallery, wrapped over the cables on the roof, white, black and brown, each of which almost vaguely resemble each other.
This 30 portrait was created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, from ear rods sent to her by Chelsea Manning and cut hair.
The former intelligence analyst Manning, who was sentenced to 35 years in prison after smuggling secret diplomatic messages via WikiLeaks, sent his hair cut from Fort Leavenworth Prison.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2nd, is called Münazi Un Similari.
It is a product of a two-year correspondence between a trans-woman pardoned by Barack Obama and a prominent opponent of Manning, who combines his discipline with his expertise in technology, computer science and art with Dewey-Hagborg.
Dewey-Hagborg, who created 30 portraits of DNA extracted from Manning, by analyzing algorithmically and using what a person with this gene data can look like, is not just one of the many ways in which DNA data can be processed (and the determinism of the comments can be interpreted.)
Born as Bradley Edward, but clearly identified as a woman in her younger years, Manning was convicted of 20 crimes in 2013, including computer fraud and theft, according to the Sixth Espionage Act.
The image was printed by the prison, so there was only one photo: a black-and-white, black-and-white portrait of Manning sitting in the driver's seat, with a missing platinum yellow wig.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg succeeded in his 2012 project with the giant whisper of More Strange Predictions.
In it, the artist produced portraits of the DNA from the spills of legal pieces such as cigars and shells to paint a picture of what these people might look like.
That's when he got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning while in jail and they wanted some kind of portrait that could accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg said in a press release.
They weren’t visiting, and they didn’t take the photo, so they reached Chelsea and asked if they were interested in making a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned inspiration became unexpected letter friends by making many correspondence exchanges within two years.
They even revealed the illustration by Shoili Kanungo, which the president pardoned Chelsea’s punishment and could personally see his exhibition as a fantasy cartoon book, which was a future for him.
A few days after Obama actually released the book, asking for Manning’s evacuation was a kind of happy coincidence that came well after seven ruthless years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump finds new, tweetable ways to further evoke the sharp divisions that seek to war on those who leak information about the government and transgender soldiers, there is something deep and powerful about this exhibition that is currently being opened.
When asked about the strange timing of all this, Dewey-Hagborg said, "Events happen for a reason."
An artist's statement written on the wall of the gallery, under which Manning's large-scale signature (the point of the letter "i" in his nickname is placed with the heart), is "a final expression of "automatic discrimination" based on gender, race, sex and culture.
There's a mitochondrial DNA sequence across the wall: many C's, G's, and A's written with a bullet.
Including 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophisticated scientific dictionary) Dewey Hagborg wanted to tell us all, at least as a biological creation, how surprisingly we are to be like each other.
"What I hope people will get out of this is that our genome is about who we are and that it doesn't care how clear the genetic data is to comment, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, a 2007 video of his work on the Imitation Memories.
“DNA data can tell many different stories, and that’s 30 of those stories.”
The last piece of the exhibition held in a single room is a page from the previously mentioned short-line novel.
Here, Manning, the King Kong style, is shown out with a speaker obtained from the United States Discipline Winters.
"They've silenced your speech, they've won."
"So never shut up."
The artist from Philadelphia said, "This came directly from a letter he wrote to me."
"When I'm talking about it, it's still sore my hair."
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition (as he is quite predictably dreamed of from his cartoon book) but when he sees it, he will be greeted with masks with his own genetic imitations gathered in the middle of the room like a group of protesters.
Like everything in the exhibition, the genetic haplogroups were written up to the size of Manning (5<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2>, the size of Manning), which was especially made.
Dewey-Hagborg said of portraits: "I used to put them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd."
"I wanted this to be perceived as a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea, the movement behind his liberation."
Northwestern Educational Officer and Oxford University Employee Looking for Murder
Police said a nationwide human hunt was launched for a Northwestern University training officer and Oxford University employee, who were suspected of being stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago, after a man was found stabbed to death.
Cook's administrative district records show that first-degree arrests for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were removed without bail on Monday, claiming they had played a part in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said a body was found on July 27.
Officials received a phone call, reached the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with many deep cuts in his body.
Official sources said Cornell-Duranleau was reported to have died at the scene, and police were investigating the stabbed as a murder while actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been teaching microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in a statement by e-mail that Lathem was under administrative leave and that it was forbidden to enter Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case under investigation by the necessary authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," he said.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman from the University and Somerville University said, "We are in touch with the UK police and are ready to help the U.S. investigation authorities in any way they need."
It was also said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief of Communications of the Chicago Police Department, said he strongly encouraged the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
Guglielmi said: "The police have an idea where they are, but our efforts to identify him are intensifying."
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were helping to find suspects.
Guglielmi said the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a mysterious clues that something had happened in apartment 1008, had received a phone call from the police.
The police described the scene as terrifying.
Guglielmi also said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
Lathem and Warren said they were confirmed by security cameras in the building.
Guglielmi said, "We believe that the victim has a relationship with the teacher Latham."
A statement from the management staff at the Grand Plaza said: "Police are still working on the victim's timeline and history and investigating a number of suspects, including a possible family incident."
Italy puts hands on German ship
Italian police said they were handing over to a ship called Iuventa, which is in search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, on Lampedusa Island yesterday.
The police, who also shared the records of their phone conversations with reporters that they claimed belonged to two members of the organization, announced that the operation was carried out as part of an investigation initiated by the Trapani Prosecutor’s Office in October 2016.
Young Rettet members, who have been suggested to be "acting in favour of illegal immigration on the Libyan-Italy line," suggest that they have brought refugees to Italy, at least three times, directly from Libyan human traffickers.
The crime of the prosecution’s members, Young Rettet, is among the allegations that they co-operated with some of Libya’s Coast Guard.
The organization's statement on this pointed out that their priorities will continue to save human life, and that they are evaluating the accusations that are directed at them.
In addition to ships under the Italian Coastal Security and European Union (EU) mission, around nine international civil society organizations are also working on the search-and-rescue of refugees in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government has drafted a 13-Article Code of Conduct for compliance with these organizations, and it has been required to sign it.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will complete the WADA Roadmap in the short term"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to resume its operations.
"A certain period has been completed in meeting the roadmap criteria, and RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this context," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister was evaluating the second part of the WADA Regulations Compliance Roadmap, which outlined the criteria for the resumption of work by RUSADA, which was recently published on the institution’s website.
According to Mutko, this does not include anything to worry about Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future."
What’s more, the list is an aforementioned criterion; Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the results of the state-supported doping investigation allegedly conducted in Russian sports by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, approved by WADA.
Mutko said: “While our anti-doping system accepts a failure, we are conducting an investigation.
All precautions have been taken.
But there is no state program and we will not accept anything that hasn’t existed.”
Mutko’s words were repeated by Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Smirnov, speaking to the Russian broadcaster RSport early in the day, acknowledged his past problems with the Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on many occasions that the report contains anti-doping positions and regulations.
No one is thinking of accepting the report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
In November 2005, the WADA suspended Russia’s doping controls in the wake of a doping scandal.
What is more, international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests this June.
In July, following a visit to the agency’s headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli said that he was “progressing in the right direction” to make things work again.

The President of Galatasaray does not return empty-handed
Galatasaray's former president Faruk Duren criticized Uzbek in a harsh language President Dursun who went to Bucharest and the capital to transfer to Ndiaye to convince Mircea Lucescu.
Here are the specific statements the legendary president made for SABAH readers:
Lucescu-Uzbek talk: “We were finishing when we left.”
The president of Galatasaray does not go empty, nor does his hand return empty.
Ndiaye transfer: The President of Galatasaray does not go to football.
The footballer comes to the president's feet.
Of course, they know whether he kisses or kisses his hand.
But no matter who the player is, the president doesn't go to his feet.
You're giving 9 million euros to the player that the Ottomanspor has taken for 300,000 euros.
It's going to be 7.5 million, not 9 million with bonuses!
You’ve already made a big investment, of course you’ll play and it’ll be 7.5...
Uzbekistan: I don’t want to pay.
But the situation is in the middle.
G.Saray values are eroded.
It's not just football, it's all wrong.
The one that will change this is the Sofa Board and the General Board.
But as far as I understand, the members are happy!
Start-ups that will help your company not be the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the employee’s happiness in the e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were usually vague, helpless, or worse, deceptive.
Even though he committed anonymity, some employees didn't trust him for a while.
Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce company on hair care in San Francisco, said: "There has never been consistency or objectivity."
He also called out to someone outside to help.
A new kind of human resources start-up is emerging to enable companies to understand how their employees feel.
These are the ones that make a software that measures employees’ occupations and licenses them to perform scam-optional surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide direct anonymity and complaint assistance lines to employees, and, in some cases, provide guidance and guidance on how to apply them.
Jim Barnett, Glint’s founding partner and chairman of Redwood City start-up, who measured employees’ employment by software analytics tools by companies, said, “There are now tools that monitor your health like Strava and Fitbit, but where’s your company’s Fitbit?”
Errett says, using Glint, he better understands what his employees think and feel after three years.
In addition to providing slippery surveys and optional surveys to specific teams, it offers a thermal map showing which departments of the company have the most complaints and which manager has a view of having low liking scores; thus, the reasons for these can be confused.
In order to not be the next Uber, companies begin to understand that they need to have information about the culture of their jobs; inside a scandal since Uber described a harassment environment in which those who clearly said what they were thinking in a blog post posted by an ex-employee were penalized.
For start-ups like Glint, this request for oversight means a very lucrative business opportunity.
According to the website Let’s Talk Payments, the financial technology insights could be worth <0x24>118.7 billion in the global governance, regulation and compatibility industry by 2020.
The interest and activity of Denver-based Colorado-based start-up Convercent, which helps companies identify and prevent misconduct, has grown among Uber’s disrepute debates earlier this year.
Convercent has close to 600 customers including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to make personalized "sister" detections, collect real-time secret responses, and extract heat maps of problematic areas.
It also offers a helpline that can send an anonymous message that employees can report bad behavior.
If the president is accused, the complaints go directly to the board of directors.
Covercent's founder and chairman Patrick Quinlan said, "The public court has seized the organizers."
Quinlan said: “If a company treats its employees badly or does not behave ethically, even if regulators fail to implement consumer boycotts, employee failures, or cases, it may face costly consequences.
The restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday, with more than 25,000 employees in 500 positions, has been using Convercent for more than a year to make employees aware of the principles and procedures and provide easy access to the company’s headquarters.
When an employee wanted to report a problem in advance, he had to find a phone number or e-mail from the company’s headquarters, had an official complaint, and hoped to be taken seriously.
Ruby Tuesday’s chief legal adviser James Vitrano said that these were mostly scary and disturbing experiences, not a good way to track down employee complaints.
But now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from managers in the office, city, or state distances (such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair pay application) can be detected and solved more quickly.
Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group, said: “I can approach this employment experience even more with a holistic, 360-degree perspective.”
“We are also protecting our shareholders against business cases.”
In 2002, after the collapse of Arthur Andersen’s accounting firm due to the violation of ethical values caused by Enron’s scandal, companies took matters of ethics, values, and employee relationships more seriously in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after “social media came to its senses,” companies noticed that they would prevent their dirty clothes from becoming viral.
“Before technology was used to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Converter offer software as a service and charge repeated fees for the use of their products.
This is a business model and opportunity that supports both start-ups with the approval of venture capital investors.
Convercent received <0x24>10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February and raised its total capital to <0x24>47 million.
Glint made <0x24>10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and raised its total funding to <0x24>60 million.
These investments are not very surprising when taking into account the nature, cultures and risk capital of companies that are linked to each other.
Increasing amount of research shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are only minimal requirements.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued, and give their time to a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, vice president of LinkedIn’s global benefits and working experience, who uses both Convercent and Glint, said: “When people are happy to be in a company, when they feel their voices are heard and they are satisfied with the work they do, they are able to do more than that.”
Investors make a profit when their own portfolio companies do a good job; companies do a good job if they feel like they belong to the company, even if their employees are drunk.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase the intimacy and belonging of employees, it is not surprising to find support.
To have data on employee engagement is important for workplace culture experts.
But the data is useless if the company's managers don't act.
In fact, a company can create expectations that the change is coming if it wants feedback from its employees.
And if expectations don’t come fast enough or never, it can cause disappointment and make employees feel like they’re broken.
Russell Raath, chairman of consulting firm Kotter International, said: “If you want 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready for 4,000 talks.”
“Because if you don’t follow me, the employees will think, ‘Have you really heard me?
Do you care?
And if you don’t care, why should I care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who did monthly worker surveys, was able to move on the same day when a problem was reported in Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees who were overwhelmed by the decision-making mechanism and quality of communication, he was able to reorganize various teams within the company and add communication training to solve problems.
On Ruby Tuesday, the company is gaining new insights about its employees and hopes that in the long run this will be able to hold more workers in such an industry known for its high number of employees.
Vitrona said, "If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you lose people."
"And if you lose people, you will lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you will lose companies.”
The NCAA lifting two training sessions every day is a long day for the Bruins.
It comes at 11 p.m. and a team of UCLA soccer players gather to chat on the edge of the new training ground on campus.
Some reveal their slippery backs from the first day's trouble at the training camp that they've shaved the tops of their shapes.
For an important part of the team, these empty minutes form a midday break.
After 3 hours of training, the registered players will return to their homes for summer classes and will work on their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before returning to Tuesday: "The next three days is a torture for these men."
The NCAA's lifting of two training sessions a day, arranged to lift the burden on the players, actually extended their days until at least Friday's finals were over.
Therefore, the UCLA’s first three training sessions were scheduled to start at 7.15 p.m. to adapt to the already cramped schedule of the players.
In return for the absence of two trainings a day, Bruins takes a week closer to the start of the camp than last season, and trains for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood during summer school.
In September, they plan to do 18 training sessions before they begin their official match preparations for their openings against Texas A&M.
Mora said that while players have added new pencils to their intensive work programme, the NCAA supported the change in rules.
Mora said, "We put a huge burden on them for three or four days, and this is very difficult."
"And they've been through this recently; they're working, great kids.
I think we'll have more time on Saturday, it's going to be really great."
UCLA will stop their training when the camp is over; it’s not easy when the luxury hotel Luskin Center is thought to be on the line of sight, held in the nearby parking lot and surrounded by the football ball rain and covered with a protective net behind the castle.
Bruins players are scheduled to settle in the hotel from the beginning of this week, but Mora admits that during the season there may be a problem with the emptying of these rooms.
Mora said, "We will be safe."
"It's a real concern, and it's not too hard to think of someone renting a room and sitting there and taking a training video.
If a workout has a video recording, that's a pretty good thing.
But we're gonna have security there, and we're gonna have security on the parking lot up at 8:00.
We will do our best with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
Facebook boosts story verification power to fight fake news
Facebook will send more potential fake articles to third-party story verifiers and showcase their findings under the original sharing, according to the world’s largest online social network, which has been trying to combat what are called fake news on Thursday.
In a statement on the company’s website, he said they would use updated machine learning to detect potential fraud and send it to story verifiers, and this would potentially show the story verification results under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the main distribution points of news that many believe to have affected the 2016 U.S. presidential election as fake news.
France's voters are facing fake news before the presidential election in May, and Germany's political backing on a major question in the event that they fail to quickly remove hate-filled shares on social media before the elections there.
In a separate statement in German on Thursday, Facebook said that a test for the new story verification feature was being launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Facebook News Stream Product Manager Sara Su said in a blog: "In addition to seeing which stories are discussed by third-party story verifiers, people want more resources to make informed decisions about what they read and share."
He added that Facebook would continue to test the “related article” feature and work on other changes in the news stream to reduce fake news.
Creating a comic book: The story of a castle in England
Recently, the little Scottney Castle was featured in a Squeeze music club and became a haven for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But right now, Scotney has witnessed a 700-year-old roaring history from a comfortable seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent, inspired by a comic book written by a Yorkshire fan of historical documents.
"I find it nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he said.
"How personal it is to keep this letter in my hands."
A castle in England from Edward's era to the Middle Ages, each story is depicted by a different artist from the United Kingdom (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg).
This is not Rhodes's first archive-based book: He also wrote The Teeth of the Dead Man and Other Stories in 2014, an unexpectedly emotional project inspired by stories in the British Library.
"I've even got a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a dual agent working for the supporters of King James," he says.
"That was his fingerprint!
Letters are always smelly, because at that time you would light a fire for the light.
For the next 300 years, it smells like he's there.
“I love the archives!”
As someone in love with the old papers, getting support from the National Trust and the British Art Council and being able to stay in a castle for almost four months ("I've been overwhelmingly warm to be honest.") looks too good.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the "new" castle of the Victorian period, scanning the archives and working many treasures and antiquities, such as backbones and bottles that had spent centuries in holes, mounted on the walls of the estate.
He toured the lands and remains of the old castle by talking to the guardians, gardeners, and sometimes artists working on the illustrations of the book.
Then, at night, he would "drink and write."
The full access to the National Trust is not known by the detailed history of Scotney as the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff began to take over the archives, which he describes as: "For centuries, aristocrats were saying, 'Oh, throw him in the middle of the ceiling.'
The diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps that set the limits of who owns what: "You think the land disputes will be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was an oak tree fighting over the two families.
Damn it, people!"
Some of the stories in the collection, including The Labourer who left the newly built castle to join the Peasant Rebellion in 1381, use the castle as a leap point to make a wider entrance to English history.
"This book, The Knights of Kent and Sussex, has a record of a rebellion in the castle in 1380," says Rhodes.
“The uprising had started around here and I thought a rebellion could be a good starting point.
Maybe they’re both connected?”
Other stories closely related to the history of the castle, for example, The Priest tells the story of the Darrell family who kept a Civita priest for seven years during the British Resurrections.
Or the Smuggler, where 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have filled a taboo with stones and his own funeral, was the discovery of the taboo being removed from the ground years later.
Darrell’s favorite of Rhodes’s Scotney family: “These gentlemen seemed pretty straightforward, always indebted and spending money on things they couldn’t afford.
In different generations, Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women; I imagine them as a group of handsome men who have the tendency to make a heirloom for women."
Rhodes finishes his quest at the castle, looking for other writing experiences.
In Finnish wildlife, a field of a sanatorium at the beginning of the 20th century, he has since completed a two-week work for a comic book about the Life of Nature recaptured by nature.
But Scotney holds a separate place in his heart.
He says, "I'm sorry I'm upset."
"Sanki: 'Ah, now I have to go and face the damn real life.' "
Meral Ak<0xC5><0x9F>ener's reaction to Maho
<0xC4><0xB0>smet Büyükataman, the Secretary General of the Nationalist Movement Party, has recently made a written statement on social media and press resignation claims regarding MHP.
The mass media and "some old rifle Marxists from the corners" used the expression "shocked" to the MHP, calling for "plays and plays to be used to prevent the movement from continuing its presence under the MHP roof after 12 September."
The Grand Duke said:
"As much as the history of the Turkish people is broken, the criminal file is broken, the idea is blurred, the mind is confused, the hands are swollen," he said.
"The MHP Kocaeli Gölcük County Organization and its members have resigned 410 people and 215 people in the Yeni<0xC5><0x9F>ehir district of MHP Bursa."
With 250 resignations, 300 resignations, the public is being misdirected.
He lies in the newspaper columns, and the deception is deepened.
As this number of resignations reaches us, the number of hostages in the places we are talking about does not cross the fingers of a hand.
The U.S. Supreme Court, which refers to the accusations, said it was attempting to misdirect the public and to manage perceptions with the polls it once again called "the verdict".
"The propaganda and campaigns that are turning to create perceptions of these against the MHP will be reversed," he said.
MHP’s Secretary General, MHP Büyükataman, who said that Turkish politics is an important and irrevocable actor, said:
The power of the former Marxists is not enough to destroy the MHP’s place in the conscience of the Turkish people.
There is a dirty account behind all the comments made, applied perception management methods.
Because politics and the media have focused their attention on the basis of MHP.
There is no meaning in our resignation of those who have done no good work and effort in favour of our party while we are in between.
What's wrong with those who can't use our side for the sake of nephews?
In their lives, they must find a different occupation for themselves, who has not touched the MHP, who has not shared our memories, who has not understood our countries, who have not participated in our struggle, who have always been on the brink of coal-fired, heart-stoned mentality.
The efforts of the Nationalist Movement to train the unity and integrity of those who are unable to do so, the quests for debate and for lifting them up, are an effort in vain.
And he will surely turn back and strike his owner.
The Nationalist Movement is the last stronghold of the Turkish people, despite heavy destruction.
In the statement, the Grand Duma, which says "political hearts" and "political crooks" for those who target the MHP, "is not without nationalist movement."
"The external mice inside the roots that feed beyond the ocean will not reach their targets at any cost," he said.
The MHP, which uses the phrase "truthful traitors will become mad and ash in a small fire," was found in the statement, categorizing opposition parties and terrorist organizations together, saying, "From CHP to HDP, from KKK to PET, from KKK to PET."
Yesterday we resisted the new tactics and games of those who plan for Turkey without MHP; the MHP-free government, we fought to the end with the dishonest people who wanted the MHP-free Assembly.
Now we're going to ruin the games, we're going to ruin the players.
"The patent of prosperity is in the MHP," the Grand Duke used the words of Meral Aksener in imitation: "As in the old film Banker Bilo, I'm going to take the Maho villagers to Germany, as I want them, after they've been riding a bucket in the truck's trunk for days.
This is their matter, but our only request from these mysticals is to be the new place where they go.
Kjaer signed for Seville
Kjaer signed the official contract of 12.5 million euros bedelle transfer from the yellow-lacible team to Sevilla, the Spanish team's most expensive defensive transfer.
The Danish star will wear the No. 4 form in Seville.
Greater ease than THY for baby families
According to the THY Press Release, the national airline, which keeps its passengers’ flight comfort and satisfaction in the forefront and works to make them feel more comfortable during the flight, continues to develop new ideas for an excellent travel experience.
In this regard, the "baby travel kit" prepared to examine the needs of infants and their families between the ages of 0 and 2 began to be offered to infant passengers travelling on intercontinental flights from August.
Inside the kit, made with a custom-designed bag; the bottom replacement cover, disposable breast restraint, cat cream, baby lotion and shampoo, newborn wet cotton mantle and chest pad.
Paraben, Alcohol, products that do not contain harmful chemicals with paint, are produced in view of the sensitivity of the baby’s skin.
Washington is changing the rules of the green card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump said there would be a new U.S. immigration plan that would change the Green Card rules.
Legal immigrants are expected to drop by 50,000 a year, tighter rules for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules were proposed by the Republicans and were also supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed on both sides of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and change the way we give green cards to U.S. citizens in other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing regime.
This new application process will result in English-speaking candidates, well-equipped financial resources, and those who have the skills to benefit our economy,” Trump said in a statement.
Writers reviewed Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz match
I haven't been able to find it for two seasons, I haven't seen it, and I've seen it again, Kad<0xC4><0xB1>köy...
A "deep-hearted" team, which Aykut the Great took out in the absences, was on the field to make a deal with his supporters to "stay behind us."
We can bring criticism to the game, positions, or performances, but I haven’t seen a game that works and looks like that for a long time.
In the first game, he declared his apoliticality yesterday on his own shoulder; Fenerbahçe's field commander is now Valbuena.
It was an age problem when transferred, but in the words of Kogaman there was a phrase "unchanged character."
Thirty years ago, we gave the name of the atomic ants to Reza <0xC4><0x8C>al<0xC4><0xB1>mbay.
If it does, it will be the best comment for the French player.
He was everywhere in the field, joining all of his pass organizations, always taking responsibility and scoring a short-sized giant show.
Alper's lead play left the Sturm Graz team "restricted" on the pitch for a long time.
Fenerbahçe was constantly looking for a formula to cross such a hard wall as this without throwing a corneal.
They dominate the ball, but they do not produce an effective pass in the field of punishment of some kind of rival.
This image may bring the "need forehand" comment, but we are faced with a game that hesitates to pass on to Ahmethan, who can't put the only centrifugal in his hand.
Either the team doesn’t trust the young player, or the performance needs to improve a little more.
They did not take advantage of two clear opportunities after scoring 1-1.
It was important for them to pass the tour, but it made the night even more beautiful to raise this supporter who was standing up for the players' struggle.
There will probably be 1-2 new transfers until Monday.
But the truth is, Fenerbahçe's biggest need is number 12...
We are on the threshold of a very bright and enjoyable season with this game style that carries the heart of the tribals trying to play at the front.
Aykut Giant's machine builds the zember, he needs a little more time.
Physical quality is good.
The quality of the game will also improve.
You can also see that all footballers on the field have increased their self-confidence.
They need a lot of applause for a new page last night.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
A new report on technological developments in the sex robot industry is coming out as you think 2017 won’t be even more surprising.
Oh, yes.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Responsible Robot Science Foundation (FRR) released a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to 10 years.
We must take their rise seriously, according to the retired professor of robot science and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and the founder of the FRR, Noel Sharkey.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, the shape of the breast tip and the type of nail.
Mr. Sharkey said of the publication of the new report, "People laugh at them a little bit, but companies actually love them a lot, and we'll see them more."
Modern sex babies evolved into robots with hot silicone skin, which is touching from inflatable similarities, especially human-like reactions performed by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robots to match their own blood by choosing everything from the robot’s eye color, breast tip shape and nail type or color.
But the fact that so many robots have “personalities” to make a Stepford Woman innovate makes it even more disturbing.
Modern sex babies have evolved to silicone-shaped robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to personalize (e.g. attraction) according to the character characteristics they find their own robots attractive.
Then there are Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, featuring pre-programmed personalities, with the personality of "Frijit Farrah" and "adventurer", including "Wild Wendy".
True Companion's website reads: "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as much as possible."
So what you love is what you love, what you don’t like, what you don’t like, etc.
They also have the same mental state of mind in the day as real people.
It can be sleepy, willing to talk, or it can be "in full mode."
There are many disturbing sides to the rise of sex robots: not only the place of real human relationships, but the more obedient female personality traits, the most thoughtful of the rape calls approaching Frijit Farah.
On its website True Companion resembles Roxxxy as a vibrator, but it is for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" the website says.
What’s more, these sex robots aren’t just fetishes or sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat towards sex desire by bending the neck, an optional additive from the ideal of gender equality.
Many men will naturally not have sex robots, and although FRR is paying attention to their growing popularity, they are still on the outskirts of consumer culture.
But those who leak from the tip can be highly instructive about the progress of the period in which we are living.
Many people aren’t weird or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be so.
It’s no coincidence that in the White House there’s a president who boasts of sexual assault on women in a time when these sophisticated sex robots are in danger of women’s rights around the world.
The most frightening aspect of The Handmaid’s Tale TV series is not the depictions that show all the details, the dead bodies or the eyebrows, but how realistic the image makes it feel.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but it doesn’t feel like such a big change right now.
The purpose behind these sex robots is to create as much physical similarity as possible to real women (of course, in the proportions of porn movie stars).
Their creators want them to feel human when they touch, and they want them to imitate the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their “personalities,” robots can’t clearly represent real women.
They can’t leave their wives or leave them.
There is no activity or history, nothing that will reveal their independence, or disrupt the fantasy of total slavery.
In other words, they are the slaves who enjoy.
Or by the end of 2017: carols.
Attack on U.S. military convoy: There are dead and wounded...
In a suicide attack in the Karabakh district of the capital of Kabul, Afghanistan, foreign military forces operating in the country were targeted.
One NATO soldier and three civilians were also injured in the explosion, five of the wounded were American soldiers in the convoy and one was a translator working with NATO forces.
In an official statement issued by the NATO Support Forces in Afghanistan, it was stated that NATO forces detonated the home-made bomber during a joint patrol mission with the Afghan National Army.
The injured personnel were reportedly treated at Bagram Airport at the American Military Hospital.
The wounded are not life-threatening.
According to the local press, the suicide bomber is a Taliban man.
Trump's big deal?
Showing Mitt Romney like a right-handed timsel
The micro-scale division of the political division that polarized U.S. voters became a reality of Trump’s era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving newspapers in the United States were full of how relatives who voted for Trump would cope with the nightmare.
We're all trying to blow up our own filtration balloons.
Less is the power of Trump’s family to unite.
I mean, 'cause my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and is distracted by the Republicans in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
He reminded me that unification against a common enemy could have a powerful effect.
Everyone he knows, including his Republican brother, is suddenly and strangely on the same side about politics with Trump’s establishment in the White House for decades.
This is, of course, a good thing at the dinner table; but it seems to me that in a broad context these important risks carry.
The left was revived by Trump, but the bending effect created by the presidency created a right-wing force for the hemisphere.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, one day we’re talking about the terrible possibility that his strange behavior can no longer shock.
There’s an even more terrible long-term scenario in which Trump is “normalizing” right-wing Republicans who are against their own standards, and they suddenly seem to be the symbol of logic.
I find myself in a nostalgia about Mitt Romney’s weird version of his madness: the dog on the car’s roof has a 14% income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looks like), both of which are so real to Trump.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican nominee needs to be at the forefront of assessing that he is making measurable progress.
When my cousin was in town, we took our children to the Central Park retreat, the largest and the best three papers you could spend in the city, operated by the New York Park Department.
Horses are enormously large, center cylinder fiberglass designs (the clown who makes all strange faces and the animals turn to look with fear behind their own shoulders) and curiously stiff music.
In other words, many clichés of a city can be a disappointment: the views of tall buildings begin to get boring, the horizon line begins to become familiar enough to create too much excitement, and the reality of the city does not fall.
Thirty-five years have passed and I still couldn’t quite get over the day that I discovered that the Swiss Cottage is a large round cottage in northern London, not actually a Swiss cottage (the Thai bar doesn’t count as Ye Olde Swiss Cottage).
What’s more, when you land in Central Park, it’s still a strangely magical experience, so that two people aged two, an 11-year-old, and two women aged 40 can come here and all have a great time.
If I could give a note to the jumper, I would give him a full note, but thankfully no one asked.
On the other hand, I was asked to rate my transaction "experience" between 1 and 5 stars before I passed my credit card at a checkout this week.
The same thing about the coffee shop in the corner of my street, and the option of matching the note with a 15 percent cup; for what you bought from the desk...
The effect of this is not only to slow down the need for an impartial purchase, but also to put pressure on the server to gain personality for an event that is never needed.
While the poor woman in Bonmarch stood up smiling like an apology, I, in my boredom, gave her five stars to my experience of handing out credit cards.
When the temperature was 41 degrees, they wore a sweater.
In Tunceli, one of the hottest days of the season, the people flowed to the beaches of Munzur.
From noon onwards, the young, children, the elderly, women and men, who entered the beaches on the banks of Munzur Tea, tried to protect them from heat by cooling down in water such as ice.
The beaches on the banks of Munzur Tea were crowded, especially because Tunnelile citizens living in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom spent their holidays in the Aegean or the Mediterranean instead.
Suna Tosun, one of the coolers on Munzur Beach, stated that he used his preference for the holidays instead of Tunceli, "I didn't want to spend a holiday in the west to cool down in Munzur family, it was better to stay in our own lands."
"Munzur has no water like ice anywhere in the world, and Munzur cools us at these temperatures," he said.
Hasan Ulu, from Germany, said that instead of Ce<0xC5><0x9F>me or Bodrum beaches, they preferred the Munzur Tea Coast in Tunisia and therefore did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pain.
This is the second time Pistorius has left the prison for a visit to the hospital.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for treatment of cuts in his wrists, which he said had occurred after he fell in the cell of prison officials.
Pistorius had been convicted of murder after the previous accidental man was objected to by the prosecutors.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day, 2013, Steenkamp was killed at his Pretoria home, shooting at the toilet door repeatedly.
Pistorius claimed that he had confused his girlfriend with someone who had come in the night when he was hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors said they thought it was too light this time that they intended to once again object to Pistorius' six-year sentence.
The National Dispute Commission said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court, and the appeal could be assessed this year.
Pistorius, if the prosecutors succeed, he'll face a 15-year sentence.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The first hac cappuccino was successful.
Candidates to go to Saudi Arabia with the organization of the Presidency of Dianetics Affairs succeeded with prayers and tears at the Ataturk Airport External Lines Departure Terminal.
Prior to the movement of the first cathedral at the External Lines Terminal, about 200 candidates as well as citizens and relatives attended the ceremony.
Turkish Airlines (THY), on the other hand, distributed roses to candidates for visas who travelled to sacred lands by tariffs.
The Hac cradle in Ankara succeeded from Esanbo<0xC4><0x9F>a.
In Kafil, for the first time this year, there was also the use of the application of the "inconsistent hac for gaze and gaze relatives", which was applied to the gaze and gaze relatives.
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Need for Illegal Camps
Two Bulgarians were detained in Greece on grounds of making illegal camps, according to a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and quoted by bTV.
A group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by police in Sithonia on the morning of August 1.
The investigation is still pending, but they were left on the same day.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told BTV that the Bulgarians were later left behind.
The Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and are still punishing those who are caught while resting in places not separated for that purpose.
It will be checked throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could be punished.
We won't go back to the Netherlands without finding him.
Joey Hoffman, 22, went to Turkey to travel with his two friends in early July.
Joey Hoffman, travelling with Adana and Mersin, disappeared in Silifke on July 8.
The friends they came with, notwithstanding all the calls, notified Hoffman of the situation to his family in the Netherlands.
While the police were on the move to find the missing tourist, his brother Robin Hoffman and his friends Angelo Durei went to Jaimy Gewald Adana.
BASTRIRIP DISTRIBUTION
Robin Hoffman, who is applying for the police here, distributed in Adana and Mersin by suppressing the missing ads for his brother's presence.
Robin Hoffman said he had received the latest news from his brother on July 8, saying, "We first contacted the police in the Netherlands."
Then, along with my two friends, we came to Turkey and called the police here.
We haven't got any news yet, and we haven't found any clues.
"We will stay in Turkey until my brother is found, until news is received," he said.
Congratulations to the second world minister, Ayse Ceren
At the 2017 Palette Swimming World Youth Championship held in Russia, the national athlete Ay<0xC5><0x9F>e Ceren Greenba<0xC5><0x9F> became the world's second in the 400 metres above water.
Youth and Sports Minister Osman A<0xC5><0x9F>ak<0xC4><0xB1>n Bak congratulated silver medalist Ay<0xC5><0x9F>e Ceren Ye<0xC5><0x9F>ilba<0xC5><0x9F> for his message.
On the first day of the 2017 Palette Swimming World Youth Championship held in Russia, Ceren Greenwich became the world second on the water 400 meters.
Ceren, with his stunning performance in the park with 8 finalists, took his place in the second round, missing the gold medal with only 27 sales.
Elena Lopatina from Russia won the gold medal in 400 metres at 03.18.73 minutes, while Ceren won the silver medal at 03.19.00.
Turkey is represented by eight men and eight women athletes in the championship.
His last words were “I think I’m dying, goodbye mom.”
Among those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which is now declared to be 30, at the moment of the fire, calling her mother, "I don't want to die, Mom, that's not fair at all."
"Thank you for everything you've done for me, goodbye," said Italian Gloria Trevisan and her boyfriend.
Dozens of people who had not been informed of the fire included Gloria Trevisan, 26, sitting on the 23rd floor of the 24-story building, and Marco Gottardi, an Italian lover.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer for the Trevisan family in northern Italy, said in a statement that according to the information obtained by the British authorities, the two young men had certainly lost their lives.
The lawyer, who claimed that the youth’s parents were experiencing a great deal of pain, also asked journalists not to insist on getting an explanation.
I think I'm dying, goodbye, Mom.
Attorney Sandri said Gloria had called her mother Emanuela Trevisan shortly after the fire broke out and that she was crying when she heard her mother's last call.
According to the report, Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times during the two hours following the fire, which began around 1 p.m. local time.
Trevisan, who was quieter in his first speech, said, "Mom, bad things are happening here, the fire is out."
We're stuck, we can't go outside.
There's a little smoke, but don't worry, we're waiting to be saved.
"We tried to open the door, but there was a lot of smoke and the elevator didn't work," he said.
The last words of Gloria Trevisan, who was increasingly concerned about the growth of the fire, were as follows:
Mom, my whole life is going through my eyes.
I think I'm dying.
I had a life ahead of me, which is not fair at all.
I don't want to die, and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I can't hold you back.
Thank you for everything you've done for me, goodbye, Mom.
I'm going to heaven now and I'm going to help you from there.
This is the fault of the Italian government.
Both Gloria Trevisan and her lover, Marco Gottard, who studied architecture, were forced to move from the Veneto region to London in March after graduating last year.
Gloria Trevisan, who had found a job in her country for only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300, began working in London for a job of <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 a month (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,060).
Attorney Sandri said Gloria Trevisan's family had had financially difficult days, "Gloria had gone to London to help her family."
Unfortunately, our young people have to leave the country to save their future and find work.
"The government must find a solution to this problem immediately," he said.
Italy's Drama That Couldn't Give Youth a Job
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, was angry, saying, "This is the mistake of our government forcing our youth to flee abroad to find work."
In Italy, the unemployment rate is 12 percent, while the rate among young people is over 40 percent.
With this problem increasing in recent years, many young Italians, including the UK, have begun to emigrate to many European countries.
Last year alone, the number of young people who had to leave Italy due to unemployment had exceeded 110,000.
Comments in the Italian press on the confirmation of the deaths of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi have also been described as a drama of a country that does not provide employment opportunities for young people.
Red Meat, Dairy Products and Chocolate Can Lighten BH
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims to be right: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This untreatable health condition, which affects 1.3 million people in the U.S. and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and swelling, recurring or blood cramps, weight loss and excessive fatigue.
While patients are often advised to skip meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the protein, the main amino acid tryptophan, helps develop immune cells that develop a sustainable gut.
Chief researcher Dr. Marco Colonna said that immune cells have been patrolling the intestines so that microbes stored in food do not secretly enter the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inhalation are balanced with cells that encourage endurance by protecting sensitive tissues without damaging them.
If the balance slips too much towards inflammation, the inflammatory bowel disease can result.
In experiments, it was found that a kind of immune cell that promotes resistance in mice carrying a specific bacteria in their intestines.
And the bacteria needs tryptophan, one of the building blocks of the protein, to trigger the emergence of cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have linked the development of a cell population that promotes endurance with Lactobacillus reuteri, a bacterium type that is part of the gut microbiome.”
The mice with more tryptophan in their diets had more of these immune cells.”
If the same thing happens in humans, L. Rheuterio and tryptophan-rich diets could develop a more durable, less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas was working on a kind of immune cell that enhances endurance, while a group of experimental mice had these types of cells but had the same type and another group held in a different place.
The difference was suspected of being related to mice's intestinal microbiomes, in other words, bacteria, viruses and fungi communities that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the rats were DNA-sequencing, and in mice with immune cells, six types of bacteria were found to be missing, but in mice that were not.
Because they were looked at in a sterile environment, they were given L. reuteri to mice that were lacking an intestinal microbiome and did not develop such an immune cell, and immune cells appeared.
To understand how the bacteria affects the immune system, the researchers enlarged the L. reuteri in the liquid and then transferred it in small amounts to the immature immune cells taken from mice.
Immune cells have turned into cells that promote resilience.
When the active ingredient is cleared from the liquid, it turns out that it is a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice’s nutrients, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that humans have cells that promote the same endurance as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in the gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri developed and developed in humans as in mice, but the disorders in the genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
He said, "This is something we probably want to encourage the development of these cells because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
"Potentially, in cases where L. reuteri is present, high levels of tryptophan cause this population to spread."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United has signed a 'show' with Nemanja Matic
Midfielder Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has signed a "back" with Nemanja Matic after his first match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The <0xC2><0xA3>40 million transfer made from Chelsea began Tuesday with a 2-1 win in Dublin ahead of UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid in the final pre-season match, and was in a position ahead of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira, who were ahead of the attack.
However, the Mavilers had severely missed Matic, who was left out in the pre-season Asian round and could only score 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted that this had to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
Mourinho said, "He really needs it, but his experience, his intelligence, his great way of thinking... he thinks about football."
"We'll help him get ready sooner."
While Mourinho started to shape his first 11 for the headline of the season, like Matic, his new transfer mates Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku played at Aviva Stadium.
The Independent revealed that Mourinho still wanted three more transfers this week, but that the club had already insisted that he did "an extraordinary job" by carrying out three of his four-priority transfers.
"Thank you to the club for taking all four," he added.
"I'd be happier if they took four out of four, but they did a lot of effort for me."
Last year, 197 people were taken to the hospital.
According to data from the Swiss Social Welfare Foundation, the diagnosis of sexual discontent affecting one person per hundred thousand in 2005 rose to one hundred thousand in 2015.
Astrid Lindgren’s Children’s Hospital was hospitalized with 197 children and young people who were mostly dissatisfied with the sex they were born last year.
In the same hospital, children's psychiatrist Louise Frisen said that the increase could be caused by becoming a more open society, saying, "Openness in the psycho-sexual field, which also includes issues of sexual identity, can be perceived as a general development in society."
Sexual discomfort is known to have no connection with the sexual tendency of discomfort.
Narcotic surgery in Izmir
The teams of the Anti-Fraud and Anti-Organized Crime Bureau of the Department of Paid Provincial Security have reportedly conducted an operation at the home of the 36-year-old F.T. on 3 September District <0xC3><0x9C>lker Street.
During a home search, 33 ecstacy pills were taken with a sensitive therapy.
The F.T., who jumped out of the balcony and ran away, was arrested.
It was recorded that after F.T.'s security operations would be sent to the court.
Home transfer in New Malatyaspor
Evkur Nye Malatyaspor from the new teams of the Super League has tied wing player Turgut Do<0xC4><0x9F>an <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, who wore the shape of Kas<0xC4><0xB1>mp<0xC4><0xB1> last season.
According to a statement from the yellow-black club, a 2-year contract was signed with the 29-year-old wing actor as part of his transfer studies.
In the statement, "A two-year deal was reached with form-wearing wing actor Turgut Do<0xC4><0x9F>an <0xC5><0x9E>ahin.
“Welcome to the new Malayaspor,” he said.
British inventor puts himself on a microchip to get into his house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor was the first person to be able to open the front door, access the office, and even operate his car with just one hand movement in the country.
Steven Northam, 33, was transferring a small chip between his fingers, and this service is now offering jobs and people who want to make their lives easier with technology through BioTeq.
In order to ensure that the implantation procedure can be applied to medical standards, he worked with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants.
The technology is similar to a microchip for cats and dogs and only takes 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company will also make a change to the locks in homes and vehicles at <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock to be compatible with the chip.
The technology is attached to both the home of a man with a married and a child’s father and the BMW Z4, and the vehicle works while his hands are driving.
The White House's show has attracted thousands of taxpayers
According to military records disclosed to TIME, the White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to grasslands in the south last month for an organization that promoted American production cost taxpayers up to <0x24>24,000.
When the president boarded, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as the Marine One, was the focus of interest in the organization that introduced American construction programs on July 17 at the White House.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured products produced across 50 states.
The helicopter made in Connecticut was displayed side by side with a yacht from Main, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House Harp Department transmits the availability of the helicopter (also called FRAGO) to the southern grass just 36 hours before the helicopter's request for an "extraordinary" organization.
The commander of HMX-1 sent an email to the above-mentioned Marine Corps Commander, a day before the organization, "I just wanted to make sure you're aware of it because it's an unusually high-visibility organization."
The message was that the helicopter would come to the southern lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17th and stay there until the lawn was cleaned at 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Note, if the departure from the White House was delayed, it added that a second flight crew would be required for the return flight due to time constraints.
While the unit was on the ground while the security personnel were on the ground, the original flight crew was in the helicopter during the organization.
It is not known whether a second flight crew is ultimately required from the records provided to TIME.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
The records show that HMX-1 has investigated whether the organization violated this condition.
The commander wrote, "A question our grief was whether or not it violated the Hatch Act and was notified to us."
"You seem to be crowded," said the Commander-in-Chief.
The organization "Made in America" is officially designated by the White House and is not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official organizations have political impetus.
At the time, the president in the organization commended his efforts to reform the health services that are ongoing in the senate and praised his efforts to regulate government regulations.
Using aerial vehicles known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is not a very new event.
Presidents need to use these to travel.
But it is unusual for them to be officially used only for the opportunity to take a photo.
In February, Trump noticed that the presidential plane was moving behind the scenes of the first campaign meeting in Melbourne, Florida, and that the Twitter account was full of messages about the use of the presidential plane.
White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said: "The White House is excited about the 'Made in America' exhibition, products made with American materials by American workers from all 50 states."
The HMX-1 crew often conducts training flights in the Washington area and exercises to leave the President of the United States in the southern grass to the White House with a dot shot.
In early July, Trump conducted 58 exercise landings at the HMX-1 White House in Germany for the G20 summit.
An official said the flight for the Made in America organization was considered to be a training requirement for the crew within that month.
The unit flew an additional 11 hours for helicopters that day for "subsidy missions that have nothing to do with the presidency."
The White House said taxpayers were not charged for any other number in the organization.
A spokesman from Sikorksky said that companies did not participate in arranging the display of the helicopter on the southern grasses.
The HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to identify the exact removal carried out by the organization.
But according to the Ministry of Defence’s hourly rates for the 2017 financial year, the Ministry of Defence’s rate of receiving VH-3D is <0x24>24,340 per flight hour.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico Virginia's central base for 30 minutes on both sides.
The White House claims that the actual operation of the helicopter is much below this rate.
Walters said, "It's very misleading to taxpayers to make a move based on estimates of the cost of reception."
"This ratio estimates cover the cost of personnel, maintenance and annual expenses incurred."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Ministry of Defence’s reception rates do not include staff returns, but include fuel, maintenance and contract returns.
At that time, the White House's former press spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for this organization.
Spicer said, "Here I think to showcase what's being done in America this week."
“And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contributions to our national security, and I think it’s up to hundreds of people, if not thousands.
And like most Americans, I think we're all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans work tirelessly to do.
So, of course, it’s appropriate to point out that.”
Trump was not clear whether he interacted with the helicopter as he toured the southern grass for the organization, but he stepped into the driver’s seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump spoke to Sikorsky's representatives jokingly about the company's products in the media.
The president said, "I know Sikorsky very well," "I have three of them."

According to B.M., Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women
The head of the BM mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections could be representative if all sections of society, including women, play a role.
Nicholas Haysom, deputy chairman of the B.M. Assistance Mission, said hundreds of women competed in the county council elections, three women competed for the vice-presidency, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters were women.
In his statement on Wednesday, he said, "The role of women cannot be overstated."
Elections are only women who fully participate, and if they are included in all sections of the election process, they can be truly representative and reliable.
The Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban has threatened the election process, which it encountered at the time of international military operations becoming an advisory mission.
This year’s election marks the peaceful revolution of power from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said the strong role of women would contribute to Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered votes were registered by women.

McVitie's GMB worries about investment in Glasgow factory
A trade union wants to reassure McVitie's managers of the biscuit manufacturer that it will be given a long-term commitment to its production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company remained silent about the future of its investment in the Tollcross region.
In addition to other products, more than 500 people work at the factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits are produced.
McVitie's owner, Pladis, said they have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the region in recent years.
If there was a change in operations, he added that workers and union representatives would be "first informed".
In a letter to the company's plant manager, GMB urged Scotland to "remove concerns that there are no funds available for the modernization of heart bands."
GMB chief organizer Drew Duffy said: “The General Manager of the facility is deeply concerned about the business needs and the lack of insight into Tollcross’ investment plan for the future.
Families have been working here for generations and have gathered together in Glasgow and suburbs, where sufficient employment is the critical basis for local society and where there is high social poverty and high unemployment.
From the perspective of work, wages and well-being, Brexit conditions, rising transition costs and a chronic production decline, Glasgow’s eastern tip urgently needs a four-headed mammal production presence at McVitie’s.”
A spokeswoman from Pladis said: "The plant manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to our commitment to union representatives.
We held a regular meeting at Tollcross two months ago with employees and GMB representatives, where a few issues were clearly discussed.
We then told our employees, like all the companies that do business in an over-competitive and uncertain economic environment, that we are constantly reviewing our operations to remain competitive, which applies to all our operations and facilities.
He added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in production tapes and operational developments.
We fully know the legacy of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility, and if there is any change in our operations, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know.”
Necip and Utku 4 more years in Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>
The Besiktas Club extended the contract of Necip Uysal and Utku Yuvakuran to four years.
In the section on the website of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), which contains data on footballers, Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> has extended his contract with two players until 31 May 2021.
Necip, who grew up in the black-and-white team's infrastructure and made his first professional contract on June 19, 2008, began wearing the form of A in the 2009-2010 season.
Born in 1991, the player, who rose to captainship, played a total of 254 official matches in the form of Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>.
On the website of the TFF, the information was also provided that he had signed a contract with Utku Yuvakuran, who had been hired by Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> last season as a lease for staff, until 31 May 2021.
Utku was removed from temporary transfer status as of August 1, 2017, and the information that the license was renewed on August 2, 2017 is also available on the website.
Utku Yuvakuran has served in more games in the 21-Year Six League in Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>, where he played rent last season.
The young roadster took part in only two Turkish Cup matches with the black and white form.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s departure three years ago?
La Liga may have regretted his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up following Neymar after proposing a <0xC2><0xA3>189 million bailout offer, but did they warn Barcelona about breaking the world record three years ago?
With the Ligue 1 team ready to break the world transfer record by more than twice the amount that Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million, the sensational offer moved the summer transfer period.
With PSG's <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 weekly salary after taxes, the transfer shows Neymar will be the world's most expensive player and also the professional athlete who earns the most.
Although a source close to the Catalan government has insisted on the club always doing its best to keep an eye on him since Santos' arrival in 2013, Barcelona is known to be angry at the style of the offer and Neymar's attempt to leave.
So, was the football world alerted to this view three years ago by the president of PSG?
When he expressed his interest in signing to Manchester City Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a strong warning to all clubs who wanted to sign to one of PSG's best players.
Al-Khelaifi said, "I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll fight them, we'll get in touch with their players."
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they sign up for one of our players, they will suffer the consequences.”
The Spanish club in Barcelona earlier this summer seems to have surpassed this line by expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG has made it clear that they will not allow the Italian national to leave under any conditions, and that Neymar feels well in Barcelona, losing the reflections of this interest to its greatest values.
The punishment for preventing the reading of Sala was broken
The alleged defendants who are walking on Mustafa Baki's <0xC4><0xB0>m<0xC4><0xB1>m<0xC4><0xB1> G<0xC5><0xAB>ltepe Camisi, who is reading <0xC4><0xB0>z<0xC4><0xB1>kme<0xC4><0x9F>e and <0xC4><0xB0>lm<0xC4><0xB1>z <0xC4><0xB0>z<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz <0xC4><0xB0>z<0xC4><0xB1>k<0xC4><0xB1>, are alleged to have tried to prevent him from doing his job.
He was sentenced by the High Criminal Court.
The prosecution said that the defendant had been charged with a fine of <0xC2><0xA3>7,000, and that the defendant had been charged with a fine of <0xC2><0xA3>7,000, and that the defendant was charged with a fine of <0xC2><0xA3>7,000, and that the defendant had been charged with a fine of <0xC2><0xA3>1,000.
He ordered that the prison sentence given to Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz be converted to a fine of 6,000 liras.
After the two defendants were fined, the defendants were sued for their indictment.
<0xC4><0xB0>stanbul District Court to examine the file 23.
He's in the Penalty Department.
The apartment that completed its examinations, the defendant Kenan Gül<0xC5><0x9F>en decided on the basis that the penalty given for the offence of "crime" was applied in the context of the law, that the action was correctly categorized and that the reason for the offence referred to in the law was based on the fact that the appeal was based on the right to refuse.
By the High Criminal Court, the defendant read Nait Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz's letter and encountered the imam Mustafa Baki, who came out of the room, "You don't throw the people on the street."
The President has been elected.
"It's over," he said, stating that the act of walking, in the form of firing, constitutes the crime of "resistance not to perform the task" by accepting that the imam who is the victim should read at certain intervals and that he should not read the prayer.
In the case of the victim, it is necessary for the local court to determine whether the victim is a victim of a crime, whether he is a victim of a crime, or whether he is a victim of a crime, or whether he is a victim of a crime, or whether he is a victim of a crime, or not.
The plaintiff's inability to prove that the victim has not suffered material material damage due to the offences charged to the accused, and that the spiritual damage has not prevented the execution of the sentence from being declared and that the victim's complaint has been complied with.
The prosecutor, Nait Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz, who saw the allegations of his lawyer on the grounds, decided to return the case to the first-degree court for a violation of the verdict on the accused.
