Speaking to the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara explained some of the reasons he left the PDP to return to the APC.
If not missed by the President of the European Parliament, Yakubu Dogara contacted the PDP, who would return to the APC this week.
Dogara said he stood up and blamed PDP Governor Bala in Bauchi state for helping him win the 2019 election, after he left the party to return to where he was APC.
The main reason why the PDP is ruling in the state of Bauchi.
Everyone knows how much I have lost in the election of the state governor of Abuja, whose former minister, Bala Mohammed, defeated the so-called governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
But now it is the end of the reign of Bala.
I don't want to go back to the PDP where I've been, but I'm going to go back to where I'm going.
Dogara wrote a letter from the PDP to the chairman of its host party, Bogoro C, in the state of Bauchi.
Finally, he said as he showed the other governments where they looked and where they would be fixed later, and Bala was not flattering.
I'd like to travel with them.
The man stood up at a house.

The NAFDAC has also provided them with some of the terms and conditions that will comply with the guidelines.

APC Ensures Governance Is Engaging in the Future of Social Security - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In an announcement by the APC party, the government of Neja State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, and the party's presidential campaign were released yesterday.
Takardar, the head of the Engineering Party Muhammad Jibrin Imam and the chairman of the Barista Party Muhammad Liman, said in a statement that over the six-year period that the party ruled the state, Naira received 512 million people.
Takardar continued to say, a meeting with the government called for interim water officials, which strengthened in the last week's Sunday night will help to continue to bring peace to the party, where they said they had written to the international party's secretary-general about what is going on in the country.
According to Imam Engineering, "we understand that the Governor of Neja State has attempted to break the barriers of the party by organizing an interim water gathering, which is not possible, because any action taken against the party's leaders, on the writing of the party's secretary, is for them to know."
He continued to say so far in the six-year establishment of the party, about 512 million people are in the party's office.
He said he understood what he was like as the government of the country's rich committee that was set up on July 25, 2020, which the country's president urged to lead the planning of the conflict between the party and the conflict between the two countries.
The funds we have received are paid for by the federal government, as well as other activities to which the government is concerned, by avoiding the consequences of other federal problems such as health care assistance due to the lack of access to public services, the lack of access to public services, the lack of access to public services or other public services.
As I have explained, the election to remove the current state authorities is the most important election to be made in this country with the former commissions and committees that are currently in power. they are now in all the state authorities in all the districts and districts that are located in the country.
Thus, it is a pity for any person that the money of the party is killed by the fact that it is almost unfair that the attempts to prevent the insurgency are undermined by the attempts to establish a committee to investigate how the money of the party was killed and who established it.
Of the money that the insurer puts on the money that is the burden of education, the money that is the burden of the foreign party has given him, there are no such funds and I work hard to get everyone on this issue that brings his witness to confirm that this burden is in every way possible.
The Imam said that he would stand on the side of the APC from either side or side from the party's side, but he added that any ruling on the party or any party leader from the state level would be held on the side of the committee responsible for the control of the APC.
Therefore, the party's midwife does not have a problem in particular if they have dealt with the force of the committee so the verdict does not have any effect.
For this reason, they are the interlocutors of the party leaders who have agreed to be in the state, in accordance with the 21st Amendment of the Sixth Amendment on page 87 of the party's system, no matter what happens to the party, it will not be used for that.
It's because the judgement of the judges and the chiefs of the court is against you.
He said those who presented you with the peace during the meeting were unendorsed by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, Janar Muhammad Garba, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all committees, were not members of the electoral committee of the state.
The regulatory committee between the party and the chairman of the Mohamed Imam Engineer's party is who will lead the government will not lead the heads of the state party.
According to the report, the governor of Abubakar Sani Bello recalled the fact that the issue of full agreement was to be addressed to the state's community at the time of the election, and the trip with the members of the party within the government as everyone would benefit the state and all the parties by providing political assistance, which is a matter of concern.
Takardar has passed the bill to the parliament of the state legislators who have held the meeting and focused on solving all the issues between the parties, which is not surprising for the parliaments who know themselves, and who have agreed to work as a parliamentarian.
Therefore, there is a need for the chairman of the State Riko committee to take the view of the governor of Abubakar Sani Bello as appropriate for making the country's political decision.

How to prevent food poisoning affects the health of the people in Nigeria
Some scientists have warned people to avoid foods that are used in the diet to prevent foods from being disrupted by such foods that affect human health.
This was followed by a study of the quality of the food in the country.
The results of the survey show that there are some foods that are being stored in them to prevent them from being consumed.
The survey also showed that this sign was most widely used in the wake of the city's floods and flooded buses that were being made by the public.
It is used as a sign because when a person sees it, he will be interested in using it.
This type of food is associated with this type of diabetes, heart disease, heart attack, and so on.
The people of the country are urged to pay attention to avoid the use of these foods to improve their health.
In the absence of a food safety expert, Grace Olasumbo called on Nigerians to remove the products that could not contain calcium carbide.
Olasumbo explained that Sindarin Calcium Carbide synthesis is the most expensive product used by the market to reduce production, which is a product of marble.
The survey showed that the ability to interact with the contents of the products that make the customers use this signal because in a single day it shows the products they produce.
Olasumbo explained that one thing that the marketers have not found is the use of this platform to protect the health and well-being of the people.
For this reason, it affects the health of patients, including their mothers and children, their feet, their feet, their feet, their feet, their feet, their feet, and so on.
The president of the African nation's bank has been removed from prison - Freedom Radio Nigeria.

Covid-19 is a Trump campaign in Florida.
On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he would hold a major meeting of the Republican Party to hold a meeting scheduled to take place in Jacksonville, Florida, next month, as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.

China's Cimma Nasora Da Abinci Community Art Data - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The soul is the soul of every creature, and cannot live without food.
This is the reason why China's government is trying to ensure the nation's food security.
In the 71 years since the acquisition of the Republic of China, the country has achieved great success in the food supply chain that has given the world a surprising look at the number of Chinese people who by the way have shown China's number has risen to 1.4 billion.
This effort has helped to address the issue that China has faced by providing the world's largest food and beverage industry, as China's head of state-owned enterprises, Zhang Wufeng, has explained that, from 1949 to the present, in the past, China has always been the subject of food industry.
But in recent days, some people and other countries around the world have been "returning to concern" about whether China could be able to raise its population against the COVID-19 pandemic all over the world?
We would like to thank them for their continued support of the Chinese community.
Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the country has succeeded in supplying food supplies according to men's efforts.
China's food supply chain is one of the largest JKS governing parties in the world.
In the past week, the JKS's top cholera committee, chairman of China, Xi Jinping gave an important order to leave food bars, where he indicated that, everyone knows that any food and work disorders are attained.
Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world's economy has also led to an increase in China's economy, China can provide food supplies to its people.
China's government and industry have released a report on the number of gona products, particularly the country's revenue in this year 2020, showing that, the number of revenues received in the country in the first half of 2020, rose to 27.29 million tons, up from 1.08 million tons in 2019, up from 3.9%.
He is Ke Bingsheng, a former head of China's governing body, said that China has had great success in securing the country's food supply when compared to the first time it was planned to make a home remodel and open coffee for the company.
Huang Jikun, China's direct research center for the purpose of the project by the Beijing University, said while speaking to the representative of the newspaper "The China Science Daily", that the problem of China's current situation is in the next two or three years.
Now the number of calories each has gained is 474 kilograms instead of 400 kilograms that every individual in the world should earn each year.
And now China has imported millions of tons of other products to nurture livestock.
Therefore, those who show interest in the subject should take their own hands, throw them into the boat, or put their own hands on the expenses in their home.
They are able to feed themselves with the food they make.
He also defended Gandhi in court - Abba K. Yusuf - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The election of Kano's governor in the PDP party Abba Kabir Yusuf explained the reasons for his resignation with Kano's doctor Abdullahi Umar Gandhije and other merchants in front of the state's main court.
Abba Kabir explained that, by the seas, Bashir Tudun dwaziri, who said, introduced the decision, based on the demands of some of the foreign markets of the Kano state government and the community that benefited them.
In addition to Kano's government and business administration, Abba Kabir Yusuf also ruled the state's ministers of domestic and domestic affairs and finances as well as the students of January and Kano's legal committees and the state's governing authorities.
Abba Kabir Yusuf condemned the Kano State government and the assets of some of the former Daula people who are currently under the supervision of the University of Wudil and the Shahuci department, saying that he was able to comply with the laws of the country.
It's only in the middle of the year 2023.
Dan Uwa also believes President Muhammadu Buhari, Maman Daura, that the royal palace held in Nigeria is now the oldest.
Daura's mother said Nigeria had already completed its current quarter-finals with a focus on the election that was the best in 2023.
BBC Hausa has been featured in the show with Mom Daura who was in the show.
The Nigerian presidential election system did not create an unprecedented one that began in 1999.
Instead, Daura said that the focus on the work that he was able to do was not follow this approach.
In addition to the Igbo tribe, the Inyamirai made the Daura martani according to this article.
He and Buhari's colleagues said he and Buhari had signed an agreement with the Romanian government through a referendum and that he is now going to leave as advised not to do so in 2023.
Buharin himself was not the best Nigerian ever elected.
As a result, the country's largest security guards, who have lived in the north for many years, have not been able to destroy them, the ones who have not been able to work.
Martian is in the air.
The Nigerian president's political campaign was held on Wednesday, while the Kare Muradin Kabilar Igbo Zalla Group, Nigbo urged Maman Daura, because of the Nigerian president's inauguration of the Inyamurai Kabilar.
In a speech by Daura, who is a member of President Muhammadu Buhari, he said the agenda for the presidential election will be held in 2023.
As a result of their lack of social media coverage, Niggbo quickly released the news of Mother Daura's death, calling it a real disaster.
In an announcement issued by Nigbo on Wednesday, the Igbo Chamber of Commerce of the South Region, and in the case of the South East Railways, will be released by the president of the country in the 2023 elections, which is the Igbo Chamber of Commerce.
Emeka Attamah, chairman of the Kabilar Igbo Zalla Group, said that Mamman Daura was a Nigerian presidential candidate in 2023.
I haven't been able to talk to my mom since 2019.
Their game was defeated by Jonathan, and now Daura is heading for the South Korean region that will lead Nigeria in the 2023 election.
So it's complete what it's gotten from the hands of the brothers to the president now, and it's going to come up with a topic we don't know about in the spring of 2023.
As an elder, Kamata became a true worshipper of the truth.
It's not the same as the 2023 presidential election, but the 2023 presidential election, and I've shown that I love you and love life.
It's time to talk about the future
The issue of women's and children's rights through their refugee status became a nightmare in northern Nigeria where reports were obtained showing how children's rights are treated.
People from many countries attended the festival on July 23rd to discuss how the issue affects the country and how it should be addressed.
The birth of a child involves problems with things such as the birth of a child and the disability of other parents.
One of the women's parents who attended the Hajiya Fathi'a Sha'ibu meeting, the former governor of Filato and Neja state during the Sani Abacha regime, described the taalau as one of the factors that make parents' children's dreams come true.
Hajiya Maryam mother Nasir, chairman of a group that is constantly watching this massacre be fought, said, "First we should be able to inform the parents of the idea that their children should leave, so that the child will soon be released until he is born."
We will also call on the Malays to begin the preaching of the good news to their parents and to the men who make their children and grandchildren happy.
He was a member of the House of Representatives of Maiyama MP, Koko and Besse of Kebbi State Honourable Shehu Mohammad, who expressed his sympathy for the order and backed the view that a law was passed that would punish anyone who was like the law of the country.
At the end of Hajiya, David and Nasiru El-Hikaya, who led the assembly, thanked those who received the convention in front of the VOA government and who voted for their citizens.
The 'Air Media Writers' movements to the North.
Modern social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamiya and others, have always been able to create conversations with children, your relationship with the social networks of different international communities, along with success stories, news, and other political interests.
Women in Nigeria have joined in this new technique by using zombie haircuts, to travel with modernity, without losing weight or gaining the blessings of their children in the sabotage that they faced in their lives.
We can say that these children have brought us many of the young people of the North who benefit from them in the area's business, economics, education and politics.
Many of them eat food through rubbish and rubbish on the web, get the work done or build up the work they run.
So it's interesting to see how some young people instead of using this to make the most of the money they've gotten, then some who have been getting the most out of the country's southern children's funerals have been found who have left the world in order to attract the public, in addition to outside the country, or to make the most of the money.
What's missing is the progress of the youth's life in this country.
The success of the Northern Media Writers group in the country is a major challenge, for the development of the Northern youth international, the well-being and cleanliness of the things that young people do in the Social Media, as they will become a key part of the meaning and purpose of the Northern people.
We are obliged to give this association the necessary advice, in order to meet the demands of the goods, that they will bring alphas not only to our northern region, even to Nigeria for the rest.
I recommend that our youth, especially the users of the zoombox, come to us to protect the Northern Lights and its surroundings, and to provide a system that will be convenient for everyone.
Like our Northern leaders who have also criticized Sardaunan Sakkwato, the Northern Prime Minister Sir Ahmadu Bello, and his colleagues, they have violated the provision of the Northern community.
It has been discovered that, Marigayi had the shame and sadness of Aminu Kano's nightmare, always insisted that, Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows the home of his father!
So we are sure that, while we are calling for the creation of a nation with a view to improving the interests of travel and government, at every stage, we can call for peace on the North side, without demonstrating religion or ethnicity, to bring our region forward.
If we look at what the North is like, it's not like it's happening right now.
Therefore, we should use God’s way of giving guidance and counsel, in order to provide the North with a way of cultivating and cultivating its wealth.
The North should provide financial means to enter for the implementation of the monetary union without the presence of a federal government that does not protect the monetary union.
While we still love the Northern Hemisphere, we give importance to science, climate, open air, health care, and science and technology.
We don't have the money to pay for it, there are different ways to do it.
We see that the North is going to destroy our cities!
The North is our alphabet.
The government has raised <0x24>126 billion to repair the hospital.
The state government has estimated that 126 billion of the country's wealth improvement schemes have been used to repair hospitals in the country.
The hospitals to be repaired include the FMC hospital, the testing facilities for patients, the care and urgent care needs, the treatment of patients and patients who are not in favour of other patients, and the teaching hospitals in 36 states in the country.
In the past year, some health officials have called on government departments now to pay more money to improve the health of the country's citizens.
The call was made to the assembly to obtain the status of providing a safe and easy-to-use health care for the people in Abuja.
In response to the North's North Korean representative's complaint against APC Sadiq Umar, the Nigerian government should take care of improving the country's health and safety.
The failure to do so has resulted in a lack of funds that has resulted in a large number of medical and medical assistance received from foreign countries.
Umar also noted that all of these supports received were not lost to the government's efforts to promote health care, where he began to provide support and research.
Nigeria: 53,000 people have been killed in Nigeria.

How the University of Applied Sciences (FUTA) attempted to download the PREMIUM TIMES website online.
The University of Applied Sciences (FUTA) has taken on the responsibility of a group of incoming web sites, for downloading the PREMIUM TIMES page, Nigeria's "online" newspaper publication.
This web-based web-hosting organization has made all of the requests made by hackers or on the pages people follow to access their pages, but it has not succeeded.
He began attempting to enter into his life, which had been "hacking" since February 28, where he hacked into the end of his work at the University campus, and took advantage of his harassment by using the university's "data."
On the other hand, if he tries to reduce the Internet connection of PREMIUM TIMES with his computer, then he re-installs a GSM phone.

It was not successful, as the university did not know that PREMIUM TIMES newspaper had its own program, which had built a network and a database that one of its members had not completed.
Today, PREMIUM also has a collection of modern Internet Security Departments including the King of War PREMIUM TIMES and the Senior Officer of the Home Office PREMIUM TIMES.

This misunderstanding is that it made all the famous devices that he used them, as well as an old couple who could not make PREMIUM TIMES a week or a week.
On this day, he suffered losses because he followed the path of DDOS in the NTP's Likau River, which is the oldest route that has been used since Kano's death.
On the 3rd of March, she made all the calls that she dropped in her mind, but not everyone succeeded.

Kano Shehu Umar's chief executive officer announced this on Friday that he will be joining the Nigerian Press Release Company.
He said the government had sent people to their homes after receiving secret information on the activities of the people in the state.
That's why the government ordered these people from 15th to 19th July where their detention was successful.

Trying to get in touch and find you, what's in your heart - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In the Longyuan village of Hongsipu district of Wuzhong city which is located in Ningxia province of the southern Hui, the northernmost part of China.
There was a female poet named Li Yaomei or Sadiyya (a Muslim poet) who praised her for the kind of experiment she had experienced in her life and the success she had gained from her attempts to get out of the trap.
His story tells us that, trying to reach out to you and seeking you, is something that is in the heart.
At first it was Li Yaomei or Sadiya, it was never used for the purpose of taking a class, the issue that he was unable to read in writing.
God has given the woman wisdom and knowledge and wisdom, and she is a perfect example of war and warfare.
Over the past 20 years, Madame Li Yaomei has suffered a severe heart attack, where she was seen as having a stroke in her body up to three times.
After his graduation, he finished with a great success, and now he's travelling with the strength that was put in his pocket.
These infected insects have fallen into a serious health condition, even with the issue of infectious diseases, the reason for which he received a 3,000 yuan share of Naira's total of 16 million.
Surprisingly, this novel by the late Lama Sadiyya led a woman to find a way of exploring and damaging her vision to improve her life.
Without the support of the Chinese government, it increased the participation of women.
The aim of the project is to focus on a variety of different types of products.
Due to the man's attempt, the art of dating was greatly undermined, where various officials did not order it to be blamed.
However, she has created a number of tools that help women to make the work easier.
For example, it takes 15 minutes to add a large amount of sugar, but now in this time, it will add up to 5.
However, it has also provided some additional incentives to clean up the products and take refinement.
Today, there is an additional machine that cleans livestock food, and so far these products have been sold to seekers.
By the intricacies and contentment of the Prophet, and the efforts that have so far been made to improve his life and his ministry, it will be understood that the seeker will certainly be able to get along with him.
The work of war and warfare and the freedom of life, is not a matter of discouragement on the part of the government.
If the government will stop providing support, but people do not have the right or interest to improve their lives by looking for their own activities according to the state they are in, then only a few will continue to do without any benefit.
The report indicates that the management of an art or work to earn income does not require some hard work or travel to other lands or countries.
Because she was concerned with the environment and the environment, she used the blessings that are in her administration to bring the benefit of her life.
In addition, Sadiyya's doctors handled these activities by standing and standing without a doctor and a doctor, because he refused to leave her.
So, trying to be honest and looking for you, it's something that's in your heart.
It shows how strong a woman is to change her life and stand with her neighbor without looking for someone else's help.
This is a lesson that shows that, no matter what a person will do, he should stand up for his agreement, because the trust of someone is not certain.
Indeed, the Prophet Sadiya was a witch-hunter, a gentle and courageous leader who was an example and a source of learning for the rest of the people.
In addition, until March of this year, the Secretary of State has completed payments for all purchases, and has continued to receive support from the government on its own account.

U.S. policymakers are trying to reduce the risk of COVID-19 - Leadership House Newspapers.
Recently, the world's largest health agency, the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed concern about the extent to which some countries are suffering, including the risk of severe COVID-19 outbreaks that are expected to be reported, where it is stated that the virus should be detected in a localized manner.
And it should be shared by a suitable way around the world, as this would be appropriate for the great wealthy of different countries.
Indeed, some U.S. political parties have expressed their intentions of dividing the cause of the serious illness, and so have broken the link of cooperation between the country and the country in terms of war and terrorism.
Currently, a further number of people confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 worldwide has already hit 23 million.
In addition, there are people who have lost their lives as a result of the disease that has risen to over 800 thousand.
Under such a harsh climate, the focus is increased on the impact of the disease's serious illness, and the joy of it is that, in the days after that, a major result was obtained in addition to the study of the disease in some countries, the issue of globalization, and the belief in the inclusion of a single nation.
But in the meantime, some U.S. politicians have shown a lack of firearms.
Even the "Science" reports suggest that the U.S. government has already ratified contracts for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines and its value has risen to more than 6 billion dollars, including several companies.
Although, the intentions of the U.S. government are understood, the U.S. presence is on the future of the pandemic, but other foreign countries are in need of medical assistance, considering that they are more likely to be affected by the health benefits.
The "The Ecologist" campaign has shown that, if the U.S. exceeds the limits of pre-produced nuclear weapons, the number of nuclear weapons that will be produced in developing countries will decrease.
Mr. John Nkengasong, the chief medical officer of the African CDC, has expressed concern about this issue.
As some analysts on today's issues have consistently shown, even if the delivery of the vaccine has been successful, it will not be possible to overlook after the disease, then how the vaccine will be distributed, which is so important for both the country and the country.
And it is suitable for the countries of the world to strengthen the interconnection between them.
The chief executive of the WHO agency Tedros, he pointed out that, if it is to be looked at after the disease, it should be kept away from all the factors around the world, you will not be taking part in some parts of the world, or some countries that have been able to overcome the effects of the disease.
