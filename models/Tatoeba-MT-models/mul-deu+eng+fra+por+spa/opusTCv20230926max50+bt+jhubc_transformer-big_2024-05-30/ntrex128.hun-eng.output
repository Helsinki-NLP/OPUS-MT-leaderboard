Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will find themselves on the Muppet Show
Members of the National Assembly were appalled at the proposal that their title would be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The rheumatism came to light after the Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament) was called the National Assembly.
Now, representatives from different political backgrounds are all afraid that the new title could make them a subject of laughter.
According to one Labour Party representative, his group is concerned that their new name will be based on the words "Twp" and "Pwp".
For the benefit of our Welsh readers: in the Welsh language, twp is synonymous, and pwp means kakat.
According to one representative of the Plaid party, the whole group is "dissatisfied" and therefore suggests alternatives.
One conservative spokesman said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the MWP was just one leap from the "Muppet".
It is worth noting here that in the Welsh language, the letter "w" is pronounced similarly to "u" in Yorkshire English, meaning MWP pronounced "map".
The National Assembly Committee responsible for drafting the bill to amend names states: "The final decision on the titles for the names of the members of the National Assembly is, of course, in the hands of the representatives."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 allowed the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation, which proposed the inclusion of the Welsh Parliament in its name, and which received extensive support.
With regard to the title of the representatives, the Commission prefers the title of the Welsh Parliament Member and its abbreviation of WMP, but the public consultation favoured the alternative to MWP.
MEPs have come up with new and new alternatives, but the agreement is quite difficult, which is a problem for the president of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who has to submit a bill on name change in the coming weeks.
The law on reforms will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly on other points, including on disqualification of representatives and on the structures of the Commission.
Members will be able to take the final vote on their own titles when discussing the bill.
Macedonia holds referendum on changing the country's name
Citizens will vote on Sunday to change the country's name to the "North Republic of Macedonia".
The aim of the referendum is to mark the end of a decades-long debate with neighbouring Greece, one of which is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that, in the name of its northern neighbour, it essentially supports territorial demand and has repeatedly objected to its EU and NATO accession requests.
President Gjorge Ivanov of Macedonia himself opposes the referendum on the change of name, and therefore does not participate in it.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a compromise that they need to make for their EU and NATO accession.
The Harlem churches are in a difficult position, and the bells of St. Martin are silenced.
“More slowly, as I hear from the elderly, there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
Not one of them today.”
As he says, the disappearance of the bars would be understandable.
“People nowadays are in a different way,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the social days where people end up every day.”
As for the churches, Adams fears that the expropriation of the ecclesiastical property will not replace the hopes of the leaders, “and they will be kept where they began again over time.”
Instead of the temples, he adds, there will be residential buildings whose community of residents will also not help the fate of the remaining temples.
“The decisive majority of home buyers in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and this will further accelerate the permanent closure of the temples, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who emigrate to these buildings will join the faith community.”
Both temples were built by white churches even before Harlem had grown into the city of blacks – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved out of the church in the thirties,
It was then taken over by a nearby black church.
St. Martin’s Church was taken over by a black church led by Hon. John Howard Johnson – the Honourable is aware of a boycott of the Harlem shopping street, 125th Street, or the fact that blacks are not willing to sell their products to business owners.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, but during the renovation, the tone was built to order the respectable community led by Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Basilica, proudly referred to the play as "the bells of the poor".
According to the expert who spoke of the play, in July, the play is "a cultural heritage", "an irreplaceable instrument of historical significance".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first soundtrack in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was sung for the larger soundtrack of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin hasn't hired anyone in his place.
In St. Martin in recent months, a complex situation has been deteriorated with the participation of architects and entrepreneurs, who were partly led by the church’s secular leadership, partly by the bishop’s office.
The parish’s governing body, the Council of the Church, wrote in July to the Episcopal Office, opposing that the Office would “transfer the costs” to the Council, although the Council did not participate in the construction and construction contracted by the Office.
Individual members of the trust community complain about the lack of transparency in the home of the office.
A 13-year-old Californian boy was attacked while fishing
Official reports say a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while fishing during the opening day of the cancer season in California on Saturday.
The attack occurred before 7 a.m. on Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the San Diego KSWB-TV channel that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he noticed that a boy was calling for help.
Hammel first thought that the boy was just excited because he was able to catch a cancer, but then realized that the boy was yelling, “He’s crazy!
He bit me!"
“The shoulder was broken on his keybone,” Hammel said, stating what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I started screaming that everyone should go out of the water and say, ‘There’s a cup in the water.’”
The boy was transported to the San Diego Rady Children's Hospital, where he is currently in critical condition.
The shark species attacking his son is unknown.
As Captain Larry Giles told the press, a few weeks earlier, a shark had been detected in the area, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Captain Giles also said that the boy suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
The authorities closed the coastal section between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours for the duration of the investigation and for safety reasons.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's to expand on the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's would compete with expert sellers and wholesale-style pipers with the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
In the midst of the decline in sales of fashion and household items, the chain is continuously expanding to <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion in the UK’s beauty market as part of its expansion in 11 stores across the country, including the testing of larger piper stands and the testing of pipers.
The strengthening of the pipeline is due to the fact that stores are trying to fill the shelf surfaces previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household items in a variety of ways.
Sainsbury's said it will double its supply to 3000 products, including representatives from brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which it now offers for the first time.
But the previous brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be located in larger areas on stand-by brands such as those expected from Boots and similar stores.
The store chain also restarts the Boutique makeup family, in which most of the products are now vegan, which is now being sought by more and more young customers.
The fragrance shop will also test its appearance at two Sainsbury's stores, one of which opened in Croydon, south London last week, and the other will open in Birmingham's Selly Oak this year.
With the expansion of online shopping, as well as the rerouting of food shopping habits to small local stores, major stores need to make more efforts to deceive customers.
According to Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe, the supply will be more and more similar to mixes as the retail chain is increasingly trying to take on the competition by introducing more services and other products besides food, such as discounts and retailers.
Since the two chains were purchased two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos-classes and some Habitat-classes in its stores – this move has also had a positive impact on food supplies, allowing for even more acquisitions.
The store chain has failed in its previous attempts to wrinkle the beauty and medicine departments.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the distribution of the proceeds of the pharmaceutical classes in its stores ended.
The new strategy was born after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical store in 281 stores for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago to Celesiones, which operates the Lloyds chain.
According to the retail chain, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy and will offer a broader range of luxury skin care products in four stores, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s said: “We want to create a more comfortable environment for our customers by transforming the look of our pipesstands.
In addition, we have recruited skilled staff to assist the interested parties with advice.
Our brand offer meets every need and provides an attractive environment and a conveniently accessible location with a seductive force that brings your shopping experience to a new level."
Peter Jones 'shocked' after Holly Willoughby quit the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons' Day star Peter Jones has left behind after television show host Holly Willoughby quits an 11-million-essential deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV to focus on his new contracts.
Willoughby has no time for the True brand that sells homewear and accessories.
The company of the two celebrities was compared to the Goop brand previously noted by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old director of This Morning announced on Instagram that he would be out.
Holly Willoughby thoroughly pulled out the gypsum at Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones, when she emerged from their promising, lifestyle-providing company at the last minute – to concentrate on her own, highly organized work with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones was "tombed" when his television salute on Tuesday announced at a tense meeting in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, in the business empire's headquarters, that his new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million contracts may have left him with little time left, and he could not have had enough.
The company of the two celebrities was compared to the Goop brand previously listed by Gwyneth Paltrow, and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated assets at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truely, Jones traveled from the island to one of his vacation rentals.
According to a source, “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
He was supposed to deal with it in the long run, and this gives him the chance to live in the next few decades.
Getting out was a complete surprise for everyone.
Everyone was surprised by what happened on Tuesday, as the start was so close.
In the Marlow office, the warehouse is full of goods waiting for sale."
According to experts, leaving one of Britain’s most lucrative stars of This Morning can cost the company millions, from pillows and candles to clothing and home wear, can be a huge amount of money and can be spent on a range of items.
And it can also mean the end of an old friendship.
The three-child show host and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close friendship with Joness and his wife, Tara Capp-pel, for ten years.
Willoughby Capp launched Truet in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones took over the presidency in March.
The two couple go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production office.
Willoughby will be the M&S producer and will take over Ant McPartlin as the show director of ITV I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented on the incident last night: “We don’t want to make a statement about [Jones’] business.”
There were loud words, “Then we fell in love.”
He was joking about what criticism he would receive from the press for his statement, which some might consider “unprecedented,” and why he had so positively said about the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump give up so much?
“Trump asked with a funny ‘reader’ voice.
“I didn’t let anything.”
As he noted, Kim would be happy to meet for the second time after Trump welcomed the first talks in Singapore in June as a huge step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's representative Ri Jongho told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that, as his country sees, there is no "appropriate response" from the United States.
Instead, he said, the United States will continue to uphold sanctions aimed at exercising pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic about this in a campaign speech.
“Things are going great with North Korea,” he said.
I thought we were going to war with them.
Millions of people would have lost there.
But now the relationship between us is very good.”
As he said, his efforts to improve the ties with Kim have put positive results in perspective – the completion of the missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of American troops.
He also explained why he was talking about his relationship with Kim in such an unusual way.
“Being president is not difficult, but now there are not tens of thousands of people out there trying to get in, they’re just 200 in front of me,” Trump said.
Hundreds of Indonesians Have Died in Tsunami and Earthquake
Indonesia has refused assistance from international aid organizations even after the Lombok earthquake.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to be deployed, a national disaster was not reported, which would be a prerequisite for the arrival of international aid.
“In a number of cases, it has been very clearly stated that they do not require international assistance, so our situation is a bit difficult,” Subung said.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on a rescue team that can be sent to Paluba, but it is still uncertain whether foreigners will be able to actually participate in the on-site rescues.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster prevention agency, said Indonesia’s offices are currently evaluating the situation in Burundi to see if international aid agencies need to be involved.
Despite the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared to face the devastating force of nature.
Although tsunami sites were built in the province of Aceh, this is not common at all in other coastal areas.
While there was a tsunami signal, the apparent lack of tsunami signaling system in Palu also contributed to the emergence of a life-threatening disaster.
Even in the best time of year, it can be difficult to travel among Indonesian islands.
In times of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but at least three days before it reaches the affected area.
President Joko Widodo placed the development of Indonesia’s infrastructure at the centre of the election campaign, and did not save on the costs of road and rail projects.
However, the Joko government is now struggling with budget deficits ahead of next year’s elections.
In addition, the president has to deal with the ongoing political tensions in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority have begun to adopt a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people had been killed and tens of thousands had to be deployed due to riots, during which Christian and Muslim gangs smashed each other on the streets with snipers, arrows and arrows, and other horned weapons.
Video: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores a huge goal against Chelsea
In the Premier League match at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool with his goal in the 89th minute, which did not lose to Chelsea.
His team lost 0<0xE2><0x88><0x92>1 when Sturridge was given an entry from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from Chelsea's gate.
He first exposed the ball to the left and then triggered a huge kick in the far corner of the goal.
The shot was high above the sixteenth, and the net went up to the upper right corner.
The ball finally reached the net over the swinging Kepa Arrizabalaga.
“I just wanted to get in a position because there’s always someone like Shaq who’s pre-playing the ball, so I tried to get myself in the best position possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and I just took him away, then I didn’t think much and shot him.”
Chelsea led to 1–0 in the semi-finals after Belgian star Eden Hazard took the lead in the 25th minute.
At the Battle of the Blues, he passed the ball to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>, then managed to break in the middle of the ball and run to Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> started after a quick shot and got the ball back in the midfield.
Then he initiated Hazard towards the sixteen with a beautiful transfer.
Hazard ran away from the defense and finally sent the ball to the far corner of Liverpool's gate next to Alisson Becker with a left shot.
Liverpool will meet Naples on Wednesday afternoon at 3 p.m. in the stadium San Paolo, Naples, as the next stop of the Champions League.
Chelsea will play against Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europa League.
Indonesia's tsunami has killed 832 people
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami death toll rose to 832, the local disaster prevention agency said on Sunday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake and a 6-metre-high quake on Friday buried several people under the wreckage, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference.
The streets of more than 380,000 people in Palu are covered by the ruins of the demolished buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder in the case of the deceased woman
Police opened an investigation into a murder case after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The body of the 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street and was arrested on suspicion of murder by a 32-year-old man.
The police are asking the residents of the area to apply for anything that has been seen or killed.
Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is still in its early stages, but this time I’m asking anyone who has stayed in Birkenhead near John Street and who may have seen or heard anything to contact us.
In addition, I would ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded anything with a camera on board, to also look for us, because they can have information relevant to the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was a Birkenhead resident and was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, the woman’s friends came to the scene to find out where the body came from in the morning hours.
The investigation is under way and the police are notifying the victim's relatives for the time being.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but the police were told that no one could enter the building and no one could leave it.
When he found out what had happened, the man couldn’t speak.
Residents of the building have now been informed that it may take more hours to get back into the building.
One of the officers told someone that the entire building is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman struggled with her tears.
“It’s terrible,” he repeated.
At two o’clock in the afternoon, two police microbuses stopped inside the cordon, and another one outside.
Within the cordon, several police officers were monitoring the building.
Anyone with any information, write a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or call Crimestoppers at the anonymous 0800 555 111 and call Registration No. 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell Parliamentary Statue is the latest victim of the rewriting fever
The expulsion of the statue might have been poetic justice, for which Cromwell and his fanatic puritan followers destroyed England’s cultural and ecclesiastical heritage with Taliban enthusiasm at the time.
However, according to the Cromwell Society, Crick’s proposal was “insane,” an “experiment to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell statue in front of the Westminster Palace would eventually become a target in the current debate on the removal of the statues.
During the English Civil War, photodestruction was not ordered and executed by Cromwell.
So maybe another Cromwell might be the victim of the actions of Thomas, a former high priest who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's stunning depiction of Cromwell reflects the opinion of the 19th century, and makes it a historical figure to be celebrated to this day."
Goldsmith said: “Cromwell may be less today than at the end of the nineteenth century, but still many consider Parliament to be a protector against external pressure, which is external pressure to him, of course, was the monarchy.
The question of whether this image is really accurate is still a subject of historical debate.
However, it is so certain that in the middle of the seventeenth century this had an impact on the development of the future fate of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person who represents one side of this conflict.
As a Lord Protector, it is worth celebrating and remembering the results."
Killed Pig Injures Chinese Farmer to Death
A pig was attacked and wounded to death by a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
The last name of the man identified as a Yuan was found with blood, with conditional blood clots, next to a pig in the market in the town of Liupanshui in Kujcsou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is vaccinated with a vaccine in a breeding ground in Xining, China, on May 30, 2005.
The man and his cousin travelled from the nearby province of Jünnan to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning his cousin found him on the man’s body and discovered that the door of the neighboring pigtail was open.
He said the mouth of the huge pig in the pig's mouth was bloody.
According to the report, the expert study found that the 250-pound pork marta actually killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody, and they were marked apart," Guiyang Evening News said in a statement to a relative named Wu.
According to security cameras, Yuan entered the pig shop at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig was locked up so that it could no longer hurt others while the police were investigating the traces on site.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are currently negotiating compensation for the man’s death.
Although it does not occur often, it has already been reported in the past when pigs attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on their farm in Massachusetts, causing life-threatening injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig in Wales squeezed a tractor owner until he was able to alert his wife.
After an Oregon farmed in 2012 for their own pig laps, a Manitoba host spoke on the CBC News show that pigs are generally not prone to attack, but can become aggressive from the taste of blood.
“I’m very playful.
Like little kids, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt you.
We just have to give them the respect,” he said.
Severe rainfall following Hurricane Rosa in the southwestern region of the United States
Hurricane Rosa, according to forecasts, is weakening as it reaches over the cooler waters of the northern coastal region of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will continue to cause heavy rains in the north and southwestern parts of Mexico in the coming days.
With winds of 140 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane hits the east coast at 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Hurricane is expected to head north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low-pressure zone develops over the Pacific Ocean, heading west towards the western coast of the United States. As the Rosa approaches Lower California on Monday, the Tropical Storm is a heavy wetland in the western part of Asia.
On Monday, the storm could bring up to 25 cm of rainfall to some areas of Mexico.
Then, the tropical pair that meets the upcoming low-pressure masses will cause heavy rains in the southwest in the coming days.
Here, 3-10 cm of rainfall can cause sudden flooding, floods filled with debris, landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical rainfall can occur at places of between 5 and 8 cm per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, it is expected to rain from 5 to 10 cm, mainly in Arizona.
Sudden floods can also occur, with a rapidly decreasing strength due to the dispersal nature of tropical rains.
During tropical rainfall, it is not recommended to walk in the desert.
As a result of heavy rains, the canyons can turn into buoyant rivers, and the swamps are accompanied by sudden winds and dust clouds from time to time.
The upcoming low-pressure masses can cause heavy rainfall in the southern coastal region of California from time to time.
Up to 1.5 cm of rainfall is possible, which can result in smaller floods filled with debris and smooth road conditions.
This will be the first wet season in the region.
Serbian tropical storms can occur on Sunday night and Monday morning in Arizona, then on Monday during the day and on Tuesday, the rain covers wider areas.
Severe rainfall on Tuesday spreads to the Quarters region and lasted until Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperature variations in the United States as the arc air masses cool, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This can cause drastic temperature differences even at short distances from time to time.
A great example of this is the situation in the central region of the United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) is close to 10 degrees.
In the coming days, the summer heat is expected to be felt again in larger areas.
In the central and eastern parts of the United States it is expected to be warm in the first half of October, with temperatures ranging from the south of the Great Plains to some parts of the Northwest around 25-30 degrees.
Temperatures in New York City will reach 25 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees higher than the average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, temperatures in the eastern parts of the United States are likely to exceed average temperatures by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's interview.
In total, more than 20 million viewers on six television channels followed the testimony of top judge Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of sexual violence in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political patch situation has not been resolved, and the broadcasters have also had to stop the regular show because of Friday's last-minute twist: Senator Jeff Flake, in Arizona, managed to get the FBI out for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that at the time, Kavanaugh was arrested at a high school party and tried to torture him.
In his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
Nielsen’s 20.4 million reported claims were likely seen by more viewers on Friday.
Nielsen calculated the average viewer numbers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other channels broadcasting the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network numbers, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen can hardly measure the number of people watching shows at their workplace.
For the sake of comparison, so many viewers are used to being football decision makers or Oscar winners.
According to Nielsen, of all the channels, Fox News Channel, which drew experts to support Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the highest viewership, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day.
Second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS 3.1, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million were viewed, according to Nielsen.
Interest did not diminish after the hearing.
The main character in Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued a statement saying Senator Kavanaugh would cast a vote on Friday morning was seen on CNN and CBS as a loud crowd of protesters were attending a court hearing on the elevator.
He was staring at the crowd for a few moments, and CNN broadcast the scene live.
“I stand here before you,” said a woman to the senator.
“Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth in public?”
Others shouted at him, “You have the power to do what so many women don’t.”
Flake just said that his office had issued a statement and then added before the elevator door was closed to share his statement at the commission hearing.
On cable and television channels, it was seen live hours later as the committee voted on whether Kavanaugh's nomination would be submitted to the full Senate.
Flake said, however, that he would only be willing to do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate next week, as the Democrats in the minority were demanding.
Flake was convinced of the need for this by his talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coon.
Flake decided to speak with the Coons and later with other senators.
Flake's decision was to live up to his power, as it was clear that without the investigation, Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh charges.
British Prime Minister Theresa May Accuses Opponents of Political Gambling
In a Sunday interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of their plans to exit the European Union of jeopardizing the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the interests of the nation.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party’s conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview appearing directly next to May’s interview, former Foreign Minister May Boris Johnson attacked May’s so-called “Chequers” plan for Brexit, saying that the request to deal with Britain’s and EU’s tariffs is “complete.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrested Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of 20-year-old basketball player Wayde Sims at the State University of Louisiana (LSU).
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested on charges of homicide in a violent uprising, Baton Rouge Police Capitol reported.
The police released a video of the Sims-Simpson clash, and it was also reported that the Sims glasses were dropped during the fight.
Police found the glasses on the site, and they put Simpson's DNA on it, sounding on the WAFB channel belonging to the CBS network.
After Simpson was interrogated, police announced that the young man had confessed to shooting Sims.
According to the Advocate report, the court has set the custody at <0x24>350,000.
According to a preliminary report by the East Baton Rouge County deceased on Friday, the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The agency thanked the Louisiana State Police Department for the investigation of the fugitive criminals, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the University Police and the residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU’s athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the relevant law enforcement forces for their “dedicated and persistent work to uncovering the truth.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2-metre-high attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a LSU basketball player.
Sims scored 5.6 points and 2.6 draws per game last season.
LSU basketball player Will Wade said on Friday morning that he had "refused" and "shocked" the team on the news of Sims' death.
“Man is always afraid that something like that will happen,” Wade said.
Volcano floods Mexico City with ash
Popocatépetl's ash from the volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
After increased volcanic activity in the crater, and a total of 183 gas and ash fires took place in 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Center urged the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The center also observed several swellings and swellings.
Images on social portals in some parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, cover the windshields with a thin layer of mud.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity of a volcano located 72 km southeast of Mexico's capital, after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in September 2017 shook Mexico's central region.
The Don Goyo volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were detained in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protesters clashed with police and thousands joined the rival demonstrations on the first anniversary of Catalonia’s split-off referendum.
A group of separatists threw eggs and paint powder at the insect repellents, so the streets filled with tourists were now covered with dense dust paint.
Later in the day, further fighting broke out, during which the police tried to maintain the order with a rubber band.
The slogan “Don’t Forget, Don’t Forgive” and the slogan “Live Spain” were confronted by unity protesters for hours.
According to the local press, 14 people were killed with minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tensions are not declining further in the region, which has been plagued by aspirations of independence, following the referendum on 1 October, declared illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters voted in favour of the split, although the participation rate was quite low, as the majority of unionists boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year when police attempted to stop voting in the polling stations by means of actions preventing aggressive clashes.
Independence groups were on the streets all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although the demonstration failed to prevent it, it did not eventually follow the normal route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated in separatist demonstrations with his wife, said there was no longer a chance of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I saw my parents sing joys for what we can vote for, but for now our case has been settled,” he said.
In the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independent parties were unable to maintain their momentum, despite the fact that many of their most renowned leaders had been forced into exile, were forced into exile, or were forced into exile.
According to 42-year-old automaker Joan Puig, who recorded a police-supporting demonstration on his phone, the conflict was fired by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is more tense,” he says.
Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras, who has been under preliminary arrest since last year, announced on Saturday that he will start the European Parliament elections next year.
“The most important thing I can say is to reject the devaluation of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government represents when I take part in the European elections as a candidate,” he said.
Londonderry: Police arrested three men who drove into a house with their car
Police have arrested a 33-year-old man, 34-year-old man, and 39-year-old man, who have been driving into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place around 7:30 p.m. at Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
It may be that at some point even a number has been shot at the car.
Menga scored 1–0 against Livingston and the Rangers
Dolly Menga secured Livingston's win with her first goal
Recently in the first class, Livingston was a big surprise to the Rangers by bringing Steven Gerrard to his second victory, who has been active as a coach for the Ibrox club since 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal was the real difference, as Gary Holt's team competed in death row with the Hibernian team in second place.
So Gerrardèk is still without a foreign win in the current season of the Scottish League, and they will face the Hearts team in the first place next Sunday, with eight points behind them.
However, there is still a game for the Rangers on Thursday in the Europa League against Rapid Wien.
In the meantime, Livingston has increased his divisional inequality series to six wins, which means that Kenny Miller hadn't been able to replace Holt with the team last month.
Livingston isolated a number of positions against the inaccurately playing guest team
The dead team could have taken the lead long before the single goal of the game, as their attacking games caused the Rangers not a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through in defense of the opponent, but overly delayed the attack, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt proved widespread after sliding to reach Craig Halkett's crossing of his ball.
The home team allowed the Rangers to play their own game, as they were confident that they would be able to distract guests in the recorded game situations.
The decisive goal was born out of such a situation.
The Rangers had a free kick and the Livingston found a gap in the defense. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who took advantage of it from the middle of the sixteen.
While the Rangers were in possession of the ball at this stage of the game, home defense remained unbreakable, and Liam Kelly's goal was barely endangered.
This trend continued in the second half of the match, except for a single situation when Kelly had to defend Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt was kicked by Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow missed a goal from another free kick at Livingston.
The cross-country balls continued to reach the sixteenth place in Livingston, but the defenders were beaten every time. Two penalties were not given to the attacking team: one for Halkett against the substitute Glenn Middleton, and the other for the squad.
“Fenomenal” game from Livingston – match analysis
Alasdair Lamont from the Tony Macaroni Arena, BBC Scotland
Livingston gave a phenomenal performance and let go of the babysitters.
The players played one-to-one excellent performances and exceeded expectations in a row.
The team members and the style of the game have barely changed since they returned to the ranks, but Holt’s efforts are also worthy of serious recognition, since the coach’s arrival has greatly moved the team.
Many of the players also brought their best form.
Captain Halkett formed a huge team with his well-organized defense, and Menga was well-respected by Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers played without a clue.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard's leadership, they were now unable to reach that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – by the way, they only managed to break the home defense once – so the Rangers had to get together quickly as they slid back into the middle of the field.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an found for mixed reception in Cologne
The morning meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29) in Berlin was characterised by a pleasant and welcoming atmosphere.
This was the last day of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s shared visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO member states.
Relations between the two countries have deteriorated due to issues related to human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then traveled to Cologne for the opening ceremony of a newly built, huge mosque.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks living outside of Turkey.
Referring to security reasons, the police banned the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters of the president appeared to see the Turkish head of state.
In addition, hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters, including many Kurds, expressed their displeasure with Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s policy and the German government’s decision to accept the head of state.
The two opposing protests are a great example of the president’s political divide, which some Turkish-born German citizens celebrate as a hero, while others see the autocracy in it.
Road accident in Deptford: he collided with a bicycle car and lost his life
He lost the life of a cyclist when he collided with a car in London.
The crash took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in the southeastern part of the city at 10:15 local time.
The driver of the passenger car stopped, and the wreckers tried to help the biker, who, however, lost his life on the spot.
The collision took place just a few months after another cyclist became a fatal victim of a gaseous scrap on Childers Street, just a mile from the scene of the Saturday's accident.
According to a statement by the London police, the police are still working on the man's identity to inform the family members of the incident.
Due to the investigation, traffic jams and buses are making it harder for traffic, and the authorities are advising drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Injured in Disorder
Six inmates were injured during riots in a tightly guarded man’s prison, the prison administration said.
The riots began Sunday morning at 9:30 a.m. at the Long Lartin Cemetery in Worcestershire, and have not been able to stop them so far.
In order to deal with the situation, they were led to the site by a special figure called "Tornado". The disturbances involved eight chicks, who were confined to a building wing.
The members of the special formation suffered only minor head injuries, which were managed to be provided on the spot.
A spokesman for the Penalty Enforcement Organization said: “A specially trained prison guard team is handling the situation at Long Lartin Cemetery.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence at any level in our prisons, and we will hand those responsible over to the police, and they can count on further imprisonment to be discharged."
The Long Lartin man’s prison detains more than 500 convicts, including the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to be hospitalized after one of the prisoners attacked him.
Last October, a special force was also needed to lift a serious disturbance, during which the prisoners attacked the prison staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (but the drought-affected areas may improve)
Arizona is rarely hit by tropical depressions, but it is expected that the state will count on it at the beginning of next week, when Hurricane Rosa's remnants are sweeping through the desert southwestern region, drastically increasing sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already ordered flooding preparations Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as to California and Utah in the south-eastern regions of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas City and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa predicts that it will pass straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive on Monday night and bring heavy rain.
The Phoenix Meteorological Service tweeted: "Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have arrived in the form of a tropical storm or depression within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix!
For example, Hurricane Katrina (1967) reached its border at 40 miles.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50-100 mm of precipitation, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, for example in the area of Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other parts of the southwestern desert areas (the central areas of the Rocky Mountains, the Great Pool, etc.) it can be expected to rain from 25 to 50 mm, but in some places it can also rain 100 mm.
Rain brought by Rosa can bring relief to areas that are not threatened with lightning, as the area is currently affected by severe drought.
Despite the fact that the floods pose a serious threat, some of the rainfall may have a beneficial effect on the southwestern information that is fighting the flood.
“According to the U.S. Assault Observatory, more than 40% of Arizona’s territory is affected by minimal extreme drought, which is considered to be the second most dangerous category,” the weather.com report said.
Hurricane Rosa will first land on the Mexican Peninsula of Lower California.
It continues to be hurricane-like, and on Sunday morning, with winds of up to 137 km/h, it passes about 600 km south of Mexico’s Punta Eugenia and travels north at approximately 19 km/h.
The storm encounters colder currents in the Pacific Ocean and will lose its power.
The coast of Mexico is expected to be hit again as a tropical storm on Monday afternoons or evenings.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rainfall can be expected, which significantly increases the chances of flooding.
“Average rainfall can result in 70–150 mm of rainfall from Lower California to the northwestern part of Sonora, where 250 mm of rainfall can occur at any place,” says weather.com.
Rosa then travels north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday, in the form of a tropical depression, which will spread through Arizona, reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The greatest threat caused by Rosa and her remains in Lower California, Northwest Sonora, and the southwestern desert areas of the United States is expected to be an extraordinary rainfall,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
Precipitation is expected to cause life-threatening lightning waves and congestion in desert areas, and in mountainous areas it is necessary to avoid earthquakes.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found wounded in Somerset.
On Saturday, at 4:00 a.m. local time, a injured teenage boy was found in the Midsomer Norton Excelsior Terrace district.
The boy was immediately taken to the hospital, his condition was "stable".
Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset.
The authorities are urging the public to contact them if anyone has a cell phone record of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh "should have suffered from the Democratic Party's mischief and anger"
“Anyone who votes for Judge Kavanaugh is voting against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a meeting in the West Virginian city of Wheeling.
Trump said Kavanaugh’s nomination had to suffer “the ugliness and anger of the Democratic Party.”
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, where he decisively and passionately denied Christine Blasey Ford’s claim that the man committed sexual violence against her decades earlier as a teenager.
At the hearing, Ford also testified, and insisted on his earlier claims.
On Saturday, the president stated that "the Americans could see with their own eyes" Kavanaugh's "brilliant and irreverent character of the day."
"Voices cast by Judge Kavanaugh are cast by one of the most outstanding legal professionals of our time, who has unmistakable public service advances," Trump told supporters in West Virginia.
President Burkoltan pointed to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about how important it is for Republican voters to participate in the midterm elections.
“Only five weeks apart from one of the most important choices in our lives.
“I’m not going to go, but I’m going to go,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats are following the tactics of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place on Friday, a senior Republican advisor told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died in a flood caused by an earthquake in Indonesia, the death toll rises
The price dropped many, and at least 384 people lost their lives when the giant waves reached the shores. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and flooding on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, local authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of nearly six feet (18 feet) high reached the shore at the beginning, crushed many, and destroyed everything that was on their way.
The source price was triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When yesterday's flood alert sounded, people simply stayed on the shore, didn't flee at once, so they became the victims of the waves," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the Indonesian disaster prevention agency (BNPKókókó ajakarti).
“The floodwaters were not just bringing cars, lighthouses, houses, and everything from the shore,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at 800 km/h before reaching the shore.
There were those who climbed up the top of the trees from the price and escaped, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters.
The agency’s air footage of the disaster includes several demolished buildings and business premises, several collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, further aftershocks struck the coastal town.
Earthquakes could have been detected in an area of about 2.4 million people.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Applications (BPPT), about 200 times more energy was released during the earthquake on Friday than from the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, and the geographical features of this could have reinforced the impact of the fountain price.
Nugroho said the damage was "significant" and thousands of homes were destroyed in the disaster and hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found among the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that the number of injured so far is 540, and 29 people are looking for them.
According to Nugroho, the number of casualties and damage could be even greater in the coastal area of the Dongla, 300 km (190 miles) from Palu, as it was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication is "completely curved, there is no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement announcing that the organization’s professionals and volunteers are already on their way to the area affected by the disaster.
“The situation is already tragic, but it can be even worse,” he added.
The agency received numerous criticisms on Saturday for not informing the population of the flood that struck Palut, but according to the management, the waves had already reached the shore while the alarm was issued.
One of the amateur videos shared on social media shows a man trying to warn people on the street about the approaching fountain price from the upper floor of a building with desperate cries.
Within a few minutes, a huge water wall crashes into the coast, destroying cars and buildings.
The Reuters news agency has not yet been able to verify the authenticity of the recording.
The quake and the waterfall caused a shortage of electricity, making it impossible to communicate in the vicinity of Palu, making it even more difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The army sent relief shipments with cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated population will continue to need food and other basic necessities, according to the authorities.
The city's airport was opened only to facilitate relief works, and it is closed until October for all other purposes.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers set up by Palun on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian floods exceeds 800.
It's a very bad situation.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Donggala in the city of Palu, where the staff found refuge under the tents erected in the office, but on their way they encountered signs of terrible destruction, Doseba said.
“They said they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he added.
“The situation is very bad.”
While the relief teams had access to the preparations for disaster relief work, some complained that foreign experts with extensive experience in this area were unable to travel to Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, any overseas support, assistance and personnel can only be allowed into the territory of the country if the location of the accident is declared as a disaster-affected area at the national level.
This hasn't happened so far.
“The case is still being treated as a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government recognizes that this is a truly national disaster, we can allow international emergency services to intervene, but no announcements have been made so far.”
On the second night after the Friday riot and rainfall, Palun’s friends and family members of the missing continued to hope that their loved ones would be among those whose miraculous escapes would be a scam for the shadows of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the canal during rescue work.
On Sunday, the workers managed to release a woman who was forced into the wreckage by her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national cyclist team, has prepared two of the missing cyclists for the Asian Games, which this time was held in Indonesia at the beginning of the month.
In addition to the disappearances, other students were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“As a veteran cyclone, what happened was a great spiritual burden on me,” he said.
Gendon pointed out that when news of the Roa Roa Hotel’s collapse began to spread among the skyscrapers, for hours, he desperately sought to reach the competitors who had just attended the beach festival on Palun.
In addition to the messages, however, there was only one grey pipe instead of two blue pipes.
“I think that means that the messages could no longer be delivered,” he said.
<0x24>26,750 stolen from Newport on the Levee shopping mall
On Friday morning, thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from one of Brink’s employees who had just loaded a cash ATM at the Newport on the Levee Mall, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the cash-carrying car just emptied a bank ATM in the entertainment center and was prepared to fill it with additional banknotes, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
A man “approached Brink’s employee from behind” while he was busy with his work and stole one of his prepared purses.
Witnesses have also seen several suspected perpetrators fleeing the scene, but the police statement does not mention the exact number of suspects.
Anyone who will be able to provide information about the identity of the perpetrators can contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper's name has changed to Yere
Kanye West, the rapper's name is now Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday with the following message: “The creature that was formerly called Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for a while, and this was the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The name change was announced before Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to release a new album, Yandhi.
The show will take the place of Ariana Grande, who, referring to “emotional reasons,” canceled the show, the producer said.
The new name is not just an abbreviation of the current artist’s name – according to previous revelations, it is also of religious significance to West.
“I know that ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West mentioned earlier when talking about the title of the album with Big Boy’s radio host.
So I am you and I are us and we are all one.
Kanye means the only one, and from this it became only Ye, which represents the good, the evil, the confusion, all that resides within us.
The album is a reflection of who we really are.”
Ye is one of those famous rappers who love to change their names.
Sean Combs has also run Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he has announced that he will now prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-creator, JAY-Z, also varied on several occasions as to whether his name should be written in conjunction with a binding, or in capital letters.
Mexico’s president agrees not to deploy the military against civilians
Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has promised on the upcoming 50th anniversary of student ceremonies in the bloodbath that he will never invade civilians.
López Obrador on Tlatelolco Square on Saturday promised that he would “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire on the ground to participants in a peaceful demonstration, killing about 300 people when the left-wing student movements showed signs of escalation in Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to help young people in Mexico – giving students a monthly grant and planning to set up additional free state universities.
He argued that the lack of unemployment and education are the two main factors that are pushing young people into the arms of criminal organizations.
The U.S. Should Duplicate the Funding Framework for IM Solutions
As China becomes more and more active in the field of AI research and development, the United States should double its support for such research, said Kai-Fu Lee, Microsoft’s developer, Google’s use of AI, and its solutions.
He said the U.S. government had made statements about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has also announced its related plans: the country’s goal is to become the world’s number one MI developer by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for MI research would be a good start, as all other countries are significantly behind the U.S., and the next breakthrough in the MI area is on the brink,” Lee said.
The doubling of research grants could double the likelihood that the United States could take the next big step in the field of artificial intelligence, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month in the book “The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order” by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in a book that will take care of them.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an MI system that managed to defeat the best American Othello player, and later served as a board member of Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged the results of technology competitions previously announced by the U.S. government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and wondered when they would host the next such event, because it opened up the opportunity to explore new future shapers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get the state funding they need for their research, Lee said.
“China is not capturing the scientific leaders, but the big companies,” he added.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired several major university skulls to work in the field of MI.
Lee said a change in immigration policy could also greatly help the U.S.’s efforts in artificial intelligence.
“I think you should automatically get a green card for those who have a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China announced its plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides support in a similar way to the staff of academic institutions, as the American National Science Foundation (NSF) and other governmental organizations allocate money to American researchers in the undergraduate, undergraduate and academic fields.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center MI, where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of a committee called the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA has invested <0x24>2 billion in an AI Next initiative.
The NSF currently spends <0x24>100 million a year to support MI research.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislation, which planned to set up a National Security MI Committee, has not taken any further steps in the matter for months.
Macedonia holds referendum on changing the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday about whether to change the country's name to the "North Republic of Macedonia" with this step to resolve a decades-long disagreement with Greece, which prevented the country from becoming a member of the EU.
Greece, one of which is called Macedonia, has argued that the name of its northern neighbor indicates that it is in demand for a Greek territory of the same name, which is why it has so far distorted the country's membership in NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed a deal on the new name of the state, but nationalist opponents said the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s mostly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum, and as a result of the boycott campaign launched, it became doubtful whether the 50% participation required for the current referendum would be achieved.
The question on the ballots is as follows: "Does the country support NATO and EU membership and accept the agreement with Greece?".
Proponents of the name change, Zoran Zaev at the front, argue that this price is worth paying in order to have a chance for EU and NATO membership for Macedonia as one of the countries that have risen in the ruins of Yugoslavia.
“I came here today to vote for the country’s future so that the young Macedonians can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would mean a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have declared that they feel that the results of the vote are binding on themselves.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
According to the State Elections Committee, no irregularities were reported until 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the participation rate has so far only reached 16%, which was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (in which 66% of registered voters participated).
“I came to vote for my children because we have a place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje, the capital.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, and his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, left their voices in Strumica at the referendum on 30 September 2018, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage, as well as chairs and tents for boycotters.
“We also support the country’s NATO and EU membership, but we proudly want to join with a high-pitched head, not through the gateway,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, then we can turn to China or Russia as part of the Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership could be expected to be made with investments in Macedonia, which is in high demand for more than 20% of the country facing unemployment.
“I think the majority will support our case, as more than 80 percent of the country’s population basically supports EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said after his vote.
He added that the “yes” vote “means securing the country’s future”.
According to a survey published last week by the Political Research Institute of Macedonia, 30-43% of the voters are expected to take part in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation rate.
According to another survey by Telma TV in Macedonia, a participation rate of 57% is expected on Sunday.
For those who want to go to vote, 70% said they would vote in favour.
In order for a referendum to be valid, the participation rate must be at least one vote of more than 50%.
The invalidity of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the West's government, which came to power in May last year.
Video: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero wins full protection by scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were thoroughly defeated by defending Brighton, earning Manchester City a 2–0 win at England's Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
Aguero scored his goal in the 65th minute as if it were the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentine battle was the first step in the attack, with a pass in the middle.
Between the three brightoni defenders, he came out into the open field.
Then four green forests surrounded Aguero.
He had a defensive defensive defensive, and then ran more to the sixteen-year-old Lighton.
Then he turned left to the Sterling who appeared there.
The English battle was already within sixteen, forcibly giving the ball back to Aguero, who finished the action on the right foot, paying to the right side of the gate of the brightoni goalkeeper, Mathew Ryan.
"Aguerón has problems with his leg," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he could play for 55, up to 60 minutes.
And so it happened.
Fortunately, he scored a goal.”
With Sterling's action, he was able to win the Blues in the English championship clash.
The goal was born in the 29th minute, when
Aguero, staying in the space of the Brightonians, was given a great pasture.
He started a beautiful cross-ball towards Leroy Sane on the left wing.
Sane played with the ball for a while before starting Sterling.
At the Battle of the Blues, he was only able to kick the ball into the goal before sliding outside the base line.
The City will play with Hoffenheim in the Champions League at Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany on Tuesday, at 12:55.
Scherzer wants to make the Rockies harder.
As the Nationals lost their chance to enter the post-season, there was no reason for them to really step up.
The always competing spirit Scherzer, however, can't wait to get on the pitch against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the opposing team still has a chance to play. The Rockies have a match ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies secured at least one comforting spot on Friday night with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals, but their first-division title is still waiting.
“Whether we don’t have a chance anymore, we can stand up against them that the atmosphere of the audience and the other team in Denver is expected to be at the rooftop level now compared to the rest of the year.
It’s nice to be able to stand on this path!”
The Nationals have yet to select the starting player for Sunday, but Scherzer is reported to be the pitcher in this position.
For Scherzer, who took part in a kick-off on Thursday, this will be his 34th kick-off on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
Washington's right-hander is 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts this season, after 220 and 2/3 of the game.
Trump Campaign in West Virginia
The president also pointed to the situation surrounding Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican voters' participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done so far in November is at stake.
We are only five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It’s one of the big ones, the big ones – I’m not going to go personally, but I’m going to go basically, that’s why I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates,” he said.
Trump said: “Everyone can see what these terrible, radical democrats are doing, they can see with their own eyes.
They are truly determined, and whatever means they are able to put in to regain power, evil and inferiority can be seen.
It doesn't matter who's hurting, who's hiding in order to have control in their hands, they have power. That's what they want, control and power, but we don't leave ourselves."
According to the president, the Democrats are introducing "resistance and obstruction."
“They’ve seen all this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “dirty and evil and demeaning and lying.”
It was named after Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judicial Committee, who voiced the loud displeasure of the assembled crowd.
“Do you remember what you answered?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, what's that?
No, oh, no, wait – all this with a very bad body language, it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
He does not tolerate those who freely say what they think.
I was not at all surprised when the activists of Momentum in my own party decided to censor me.
After all, I am only the last in the long row of Labour MPs who have been told that they are not happy to see them, simply because we have said what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, has received a similar treatment for his reluctance to stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship didn't like the fact that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In addition, the importance of responsible economic policy in the matter of national security and Europe, which are ironically just the issues in which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
Inviting the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday, he said he wanted a “hostile and productive meeting.”
For most of my eight years as local representative of the Labour Party, these Friday night meetings were exactly the same.
But today, unfortunately, the vote has changed, and the promise of a “retrospectiver, more courteous” policy has been forgotten, if ever at all.
It is increasingly surprising that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the Labour Party.
This tendency began not long after Jeremy became the leader of the couple. My colleagues, with whom I thought our political stance was similar, have been expected more and more recently to turn their backs on my individual opinions as a matter of certainty or not as a matter of opinion.
After every public speech – no matter what I actually say – they start buying on social media, demanding my replacement, criticizing the politics of the middle, and telling me that I shouldn’t even be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than many of my colleagues, because the comments that I make are usually restricted to politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my political colleagues who are forced to stand up to sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, but do not run away.
The most disappointing aspect of today’s politics is that such levels of attacks have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn spoke last week about the Labour Party’s need to support a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we have given up diversity, and with every “untrustworthy” motion and every amendment of the electoral rules, the party has become narrower and narrower.
Over the past few years, a lot of people have advised me to get back to myself, not to be so wordy, and then “everything will be okay.”
But that’s not why I went into a political career.
32 years ago, even as a student, I joined the Labour Party because it embarrassed me that the Thatcher government had so neglected the schools that our classroom was almost declining, and then I fought for better publicity for the most pressing people as a local councillor and as a one-year-old.
I never concealed my political views, nor did I do otherwise during the last election.
At Nottingham East, it was clear to everyone what political positions I represent and on which topics I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I am sending a message that in this situation, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will not only hurt families, but also businesses and public services, I don’t understand why you need to spend so much time and energy on the road.
My most important message, however, is not to the members of the Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, regardless of whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to be able to serve you, and I promise that you will not be threatened by any kind of change, or political threat, or intimidation.
Chris Leslie, Representative of Nottingham East
Ayr–Melrose 38–17: Ayr unblemished to the top
Two late attempts have slightly altered the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr’s deserved victory in the most entertaining game of the day, the Tennent’s Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the table, with only one of the ten teams batting each.
Thanks to their unparalleled protection and exuberant use of the situation, they were victorious, so their home and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We had to face a lot of challenges during our matches so far, but we are still struggling, so I have every reason to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, a player at Melrose, said: “We need to recognize that Ayr has made much better use of his situation than we have.”
With Grant Anderson's 14th minute experiment, which made Frazier Climo a point, Ayr took advantage of the game. Thanks to the yellow card from the Scottish captain Rory Hughes borrowed from the Warriors, Melrose couldn't have knocked him down.
Climo smashed Ayr's defense with a penalty, just in the middle of the half, and then scored a single-person experiment, so he ended up with a 17-5 result for Ayr in the first half.
Melrose began the second half with Patrick Anderson's attempt to sell Baggot, reducing the team's downside to five points.
Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and had to be removed from the track, and Ayr continued to increase his advantage with Stafford McDowall's attempts, with the help of Climo.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr's captain, also received a yellow card, and Melrose was able to prevent Bruce Colvin's experiment in human form, thereby breaking the pressure on them.
The home team began to roll up again, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for mounting Clima without a ball, MacPherson presented a touch down from the penalty line behind Ayr's attacking team.
Climo sold what was almost immediately repeated after the restart, when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high firing, and forwarded Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt at home.
The star of Still Game began a new career in the hospitality industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be moving towards the hospitality industry: it turns out that a restaurant management company has emerged.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays in the BBC's popular series, which he co-writes and in which he co-creates with his old comedian Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next season will be the ninth in a row, and it seems that Kierann is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official registry, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source from Scottish Sun indicated that Kierann is trying to profit from Glasgow's "flowing hospitality industry".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which does not have the coast, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines march around the naval commando, decorated with sailboat, in La Paz.
There are blue flags in the public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have the following motto: “We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to get back."
Bolivia, which has no coastline, is still alive with memories of the lost coast, taken by Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict over resources, and a strong desire to revive the waves of the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have been the strongest in decades now, as Bolivia is awaiting a judgment by the International Court of Justice in the early October, closing five years of consultation.
“Bolivia has the ball, which floods people with a spirit of cohesion and peace, who are in a positive mood for development,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivian prosecutors follow the decision of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Hague court will stand by Bolivia and Chile will be obligated to sit at a table after decades of rapsodic attitudes.
Evo Morales, the charismatic, indigenous president of Bolivia – who is looking forward to a controversial fight to be waged for next year’s re-election – is likely to lose a lot with his verdict on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is likely not going to decide for Bolivia, and that would not change the situation much if the decision was still favourable to Bolivia.
The United Nations Council, which is based in the Netherlands, has no authority to judge Chilean territories, and it has also foreseen that it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was born just six months after the concluding speeches indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years have not helped Bolivia, but have even taken it back.
“The question of the sea exit has been addressed by the current Bolivian government for its own purposes,” said Zarate.
“Due to Morales’ hostile rhetoric, the goodwill of the Chileans has also disappeared.”
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue the negotiations at one point, but after what has happened it will be extremely difficult to initiate a dialogue.
The two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the finding that the court decision would have been unusually fast.
"It gives Bolivia an exceptional opportunity to open a new chapter in relations with Chile," he said, "and a chance to get both out of the 139-year-old dispute."
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, would use the sea debate to gain political advantage.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific,” he added.
“The judgment gives us the opportunity to see: it’s time to go beyond the past.”
North Korea: No Nuclear Disarmament Until They Can Trust America
According to North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho, his country will not be the first to dismantle its nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made by the leaders of the two rival countries at the Singapore summit.
The remark was made when it appeared that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been able to resume tense nuclear talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un more than three months after the Singapore summit.
According to Ri, “I would like to believe that the American blocking of the continued sanctions and the Korean declaration of war will ever be enough to force North Korea on its knees.
Washington is wary of accepting the statement if Phenjan does not take any significant steps towards dismantling.
Both Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
Wide skepticism, however, stems from Phenjan’s commitment to dismantling the arsenal, which he probably sees as the only key to the country’s security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Phoenix next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
At the fashion shows in Paris, there are those huge headphones that will soon appear in the top-class stores.
If you want to expand your hat collection, or you want to completely cover the day, you don’t have to search anymore.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented an unusually oversized headband as part of their 2019 spring/summer collection, which was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the stylish Parisian fashion audience.
Not-so-practical hats made a sensation on Instagram this summer, and the above fashion designers also put their remarkable works on display.
Valentino’s most spectacular piece was an exaggerated beige hat, which was pencil-like, decorated with a wide rim, and almost completely nailed the models’ head.
Among the other oversized supplements appeared a gemstone-concealed Greek dill, a magic leaf, and even a pineapple, which were not really designed to keep a person's head warm.
Thom Browne also produced a variety of bizarre masks, just in time before Halloween.
Most of the colorful masks had their mouths stitched together, and they reminded Hannibal Lecter rather than Haute Couture.
One of these pieces was like a dive mask, supplemented with pins and glasses, and the other was painted like a melting pot of ice.
If you get in these spectacular pieces, you’re lucky.
Style analysts predict that huge hats may already be on their way to top-class clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path taken by “La Bomba”, a 60-cm-width shovel that everyone has seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind an impractical hat that captures the social pages has presented another piece on the runway: a beach bag made of salmon, almost the size of a bathing suit model.
The dark orange rafting bag – decorated with rafting colors and a white leather jacket on top – was one of the highlights of the La Riviera collection of Spring/Summer 2019 by Jacquemus in Paris.
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see huge hats and beach bags in top-class clothing stores next summer. The designer has created such an elementary effect out of everyone that it would be hard for them to get out of their way.”
John Edward: Knowledge of Language is Essential for the Citizens of the World
Scottish independent schools have traditionally provided excellent education. Given the recent outstanding exam results, this situation has not changed for 2018, which is only further reinforced in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives that have been agreed upon.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students are studying at such institutions, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), and aiming to provide the best possible services for students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further learning, graduate education, their chosen careers, and the position they hold as citizens of the world.
In an educational sector where there is an opportunity to design and implement tailored school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought after subjects.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to someone in a language that you understand, it gets to his head.
But if you speak his language, it will reach his heart.”
This is an important reminder, because we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with other countries.
The results of this year’s exams show that students from independent schools across the country have obtained the best results from foreign languages.
68% of all foreign-language students have achieved a higher A degree (more than 85% of the score).
Based on data collected from the SCIS 74 elementary schools, it can be found that 72 percent of students received a higher A degree from Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spaniards achieved A degree.
These findings also support the fact that independent schools in Scotland regard foreign languages as essential knowledge that will undoubtedly be needed for children and young people in the future.
Today, languages, as chosen subjects, have become at least as important as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics, both in independent and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Committee on Employment and Vocational Training found that 17 percent of employers find it difficult to fill vacancies due to a lack of linguistics.
We can also see that language skills are becoming more and more necessary in order for young people to enter a successful career.
As more and more jobs are expected to learn foreign languages, language skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of what career someone chooses, if they learn a foreign language, they will gain a life-long knowledge from which they will have a clear benefit.
The ability to communicate directly with other nationals automatically gives a competitive advantage to applicants who speak multiple languages.
According to a survey by YouGov, which surveyed 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents did not know a single foreign language well enough to talk to others, and French was the only one with more than 10 percent of respondents.
Therefore, it is important that we focus on the language education of children right now.
Speaking in multiple languages, especially in the language of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children, with which they are better able to apply for more important jobs as adults.
In every school in Scotland, they will deal with different languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while many will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese, which are expected to be of outstanding importance to the UK by 2020.
Whatever your child’s area of interest, you’ll be able to learn multiple languages from independent schools and be trained by instructors who are experts in their field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and equips them with the skills they will need for success, whatever the future holds.
It is not difficult to see that in today’s global business environment, languages remain vital for the future of a country, and that education must also reflect this.
In fact, knowledge of modern languages should rather be treated as an "international communication skill".
Independent schools offer the possibility of choice, diverse and high-quality education for young people in Scotland.
You have to do it well – that’s how it should be.
John Edward, a Scottish Council of Independent Schools president
LeBron will be in San Diego with the Lakers on Sunday
They don’t have to wait long for fans to sit down and see LeBron James on the first track in the colors of the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play at the opening game of the pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you're going to spend on the track is still a question.
“More than one, and less than 48,” Walton wrote on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After a few days of training, James was asked what his plans for the six-game pre-season with the Lakers were.
“At this point in my career, I don’t have to play in the pre-season to be ready,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign and YouTube Channel
Donald Trump will begin a long series of campaigns in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
It will be the first of Trump’s five invasive events next week, including stops such as his supporters Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that a vote has been postponed to fill the Supreme Court’s vacant seat, Trump is trying to gather supporters for the upcoming midterm elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose their November votes when they enter the congress.
When will Trump’s West Virginia event start tonight, and where can you watch it online?
Trump’s speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, will begin tonight, September 29, 2018, Saturday, at 7 a.m. Eastern time.
Trump can also follow his West Virginia meeting online via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is also likely to touch Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh's hearing this week, which proved particularly tense in light of sexual harassment allegations, and the Senate's affirmative vote was suspended for up to a week.
However, the primary purpose of the sudden proliferation of events is to help the Republicans in the run-up to the November elections.
Trump's campaign advisor said the five events next week would be "to activate voters and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they currently hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
“The fact that Congress is in control is such a critical point in its political plans that the president visits as many states as possible. We look forward to a dense campaign period,” a Reuters spokesman said in a statement.
The event, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbank Arena in Wheeling, "may bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and may even be involved in media reporting in Pittsburgh," says West Virginia Metro News.
It will be the second time in the past month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is reportedly not in a favourable position.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to intervene in person in order to have a better role in the surveys,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: American team fights full shoulder width in front of Sunday's individual to keep hope alive
After three unilateral attempts on Saturday afternoon, the Ryder Cup was in great need for four games.
Luck and momentum here and there is a rather breathtaking sporting concept, yet every player believes in it, especially in races such as the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
"They had a six-point lead, and they have only four advantages, so we can say we have the ball," said Jordan Spieth as he walked out at the end of the day.
Of course, four points still lead Europe, and twelve more can be achieved.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel like they have finally gotten a little bit of a backslash, and more than anything else can be encouraged, including Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and they both scored three points out of the four.
Spieth proved unmistakable from the start to the ski, and his performance was exemplary.
His whispering victories became louder as he progressed in the round, paying and compensating for a critical scoring in the fourth game, so that he and Thomas were in a double downside after two.
The decisive scoring of the match resulted in a similar shout of joy at the 15th hole, a kind of which can convince the spectator that the American team hasn’t lost everything yet.
“You just have to dig deep inside yourself and take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
That's exactly what's waiting for the players.
18 holes for the chance to leave a mark on yourself.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup’s most popular pair, have been able to score more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's strange, but adorable couple brought four out of four, and it seems they can't be wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple to perform outside the pair on Saturday afternoon, and on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and Friday mornings in the last nine episodes.
Thanks to the dynamism that has developed between them and the audience that supports them, they have become the benchmark for Sunday, and no one is more expected to guarantee the victory of Europe with the sun in peace than the Le Golf National Fleet.
The best thing to do is win at different holes at the same time.
However, it would be too early to celebrate the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon executed Sergio García, the hero of the morning four, when he played with Alex Noren.
Once and twice, the Spaniards and the Swedes scored their first nine holes with one and two strikes over the pair, which led them to a wave valley from which they had no chance of getting out.
On Sunday, there will be no one to help out of the pit.
The four-race games and four-match games are extremely entertaining thanks to the interactions of the pairs. You can pay attention to who gives advice, who does not give, and how the strategy can change in a snap.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and it starts with a significant advantage on the last day, but this fourth section has shown that the American team has the courage to fight, many of them are missing, especially from the American side.
Europe starts on the last day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 advantage
Europe can start with a good start on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after Saturday’s four-course and four-match finals were 10-6 against the United States.
The dynamic Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led his hair, winning two wins against the weakened Tiger Woods, raising the difference to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s European team, which is trying to regain the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, has dominated the American team, which is constantly failing in the morning four-course matches, winning the series 3-1.
America witnessed greater resistance during the fours, bringing in two matches, but they were not able to subtract the difference.
Jim Furyk's team should earn eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari – referred to only as “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend – are the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup to score four points in four opening matches.
After defeating the Woods–Patrick Reed pair in the four-course race, they defeated unmotivated Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau for a decisive 5&4.
Woods, who had been attracted to two matches on Saturday, sometimes lost his talent, but has already lost 19 of his 29 matches in four races and four quarters, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning four races, returned to his partner, Henrik Stenson, and in the fourth quarter defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world’s first and third-placed pair.
Europe, however, did not succeed in everything on this pleasant, windy day, from Paris to the southwest.
On Saturday, three-time headliner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans how to do it.
A 2&1 victory was won against the Spanish pair Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-course races, and they later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 after losing their first race.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only twice has a team managed to come back from a four-point draw in individual competitions, although Furyk's title-defensive team is indecisive enough to keep the trophy.
However, after having only managed to be the second best for two days, a Sunday counterattack seems quite unrealistic.
North Korea 'excluded' to unilaterally drop if it doesn't trust its negotiating partner
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that maintaining the sanctions only increased distrust in the United States, and ruled out that the country would unilaterally give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Jongho said at the World Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea took "significant and comprehensive steps" during last year, for example, halting nuclear and missile experiments, shutting down the nuclear test site, and promising that it will not be able to do so.
"Unfortunately, we don't see any similar responses from the Americans," he said.
“In the face of trust in America, we feel that the security of our nation is not guaranteed, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we dismantle it unilaterally and first.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea’s disappointment with Washington’s resistance to the idea of “stage” nuclear disarmament, which, according to the scenario, would receive North Korea’s rewards for the steps taken so far, his statement was one of a kind, one of a kind, one of a kind, nonetheless of a kind.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a ruling U.S. president and North Korean leader, which was held in Singapore on June 12, and during which he was accused of "promising and insulting" Trump.
North Korea is striving to make an official point at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but in the United States’ view, Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has not allowed severe international sanctions against North Korea to be imposed.
“America is insisting that we start with nuclear disarmament and with sanctions it increases the pressure to force its will on us, and it is also opposed to declare the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that we can be forced to kneel down with sanctions is a dream of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that non-relieving sanctions only increase our suspicions.”
Ri did not mention that he was planning a second summit between Kim and Trump, but the U.S. president spoke separately at the UN earlier this week.
The prime minister said three meetings had been held between Kim and South Korean President Mun Jin in the past five months, and then added: “If the country involved in nuclear disarmament were South Korea, it could not be the United States of America, not the United States of America at that time.”
However, Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year’s, when he announced at the UN General Assembly that targeting the North American continent with North Korean rockets was inevitable, after Trump, “the evil president,” said Kim, “was not a man of rockets.”
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened “complete destruction” with North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps towards dismantling, but also noted that there is still a lot of work to be done for him, and that he will not be able to stop the sanctions.
On Wednesday, Trump said he hadn’t set a time limit, “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia also argue that the U.N. Security Council could reward Phenjan for his actions so far.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the United Nations Security Council: “The Security Council’s sanctions must be followed relentlessly until we reach the real, final, proven nuclear arsenal.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously endorsed sanctions against North Korea in order to reinstate the financing of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ríbel during the pause of the UN General Assembly and subsequently declared that he would return to Venice next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not been very successful.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him hours later of making “simple demands.”
During a meeting with Munnal this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States also “takes the necessary steps.”
According to Mun, the “short steps” mentioned by Kim would be security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, or steps that could lead to the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are being taught to have enough rest.
A new subject at Harvard University this year has led students to more sleep, even fighting overnight caffeine-heated studies against the increasingly space-enhancing cat culture.
An academic has come to the conclusion that students at the world’s number one university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should take care of themselves.
The course, according to which the first such training in the U.S. was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who teaches sleep medicine at Harvard University of Medicine, and practises as an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
He encouraged the development of the course that he had previously held a lecture on how sleep withdrawal has an effect on learning.
“At the end of the day, a girl came to me and asked me, ‘Why only now, as a graduate, do I face this?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised her,” Telegraphnak said.
During the course launched this year for the first time, students are introduced to the fundamental impact of proper sleep habits on their study and sports performance, in addition to having a positive impact on their general public.
According to Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the University’s health service, the university decided to start the course because the students were found to be exceptionally unresponsive during seven years.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one, for example, they show a picture of a college room where students can click on the coffee cup, curtains, tower shoes, and books to get acquainted with the effects of caffeine and light, how it affects the appearance of sports performance, how it affects the performance of sports.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep withdrawal increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
They will present a map of the university area with interactive icons to invite participants to reflect on the daily routine.
“We know that we will not immediately change the behavior of our students.
But we think they have a right to this knowledge, just as we have a right to be aware of the health effects of smoking,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture in which learning is considered to be an achievement continues to flourish, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students result in increasing problems of incompetence.
Sufficient and quality sleep is the student’s “secret weapon” in combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even protects against obesity, as sleep withdrawal forces the brain to starve, and continues to starve.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler design the course, a 19-year-old California student who studied chemistry and biophysics, and took one of the professor's courses in Harvard last year.
He said the people there had opened their eyes and encouraged him to take the swords along with the start of a university-level training.
He hopes that as the next step, graduate students will also be able to participate in a similar training program before being placed in the competitive sphere.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up a sleep alarm, a wake-up alarm, and get acquainted with the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electrical screens and LED light sources, which can easily dispel the sun from the sun and make it light.
Livingston – Rangers 1–0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and scores
The Rangers suffered another extraterrestrial defeat when Dolly Menga's bomber Steven Gerrard defeated his team 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox attempted to win their first foreign victory after the February 4–1 victory in St. Johnstone, but Gerrard suffered his second victory so far from Gary Holt's team in his first 18 games as manager. He lost to the Premier with eight points left from his first matches as manager.
He was knocked down every seven minutes before the half-hour, and the unmotivated Rangers team was not even close to equilibrating.
While the Rangers slipped to sixth place, Livingston slipped to third place, simply because of the difference in goals from the Hibernian.
In addition, the Rangers may face further difficulties after the head injury to the coastal sign Calum Spence required medical attention due to an object likely to be dropped from the guest shelf.
Gerrard also changed by eight points to the team that came to the Betfred Cup predecessor by defeating Ayr.
Livingston’s deadline was the same with the 11 men who took a point from the Hearts last week, and he would certainly have been happy to see his perfectly tailored team hide his opponent’s game there wherever he could.
Although the Rangers led the ball possession, Livingston took more of what he got.
They could have scored in the first two minutes when Menga first started scoring Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor’s gate, but the midfielder failed to sell the wicket.
Keaghan Jacobs landed at Captain Craig Halkett, a low freelancer, but his defender, Alan Lithgow, found only the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control of themselves, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt he deserved a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson allowed his Colombian complaints.
The Rangers were only able to show up two first half-life shots, but the weak shot of the former Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, caused little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Even though Livi’s attempt at the 34th minute faced the game’s run, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, even for their hard work.
The Rangers re-elected a Jacobs-forced zipper.
Scott Arfield did not respond in time when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who found Menga great for the easy finish.
Gerrard decided to take a break, switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately affected the game when outsider Morelost knocked out, but Kelly blocked the breathtaking form in time.
Livingston continued to play a game that matched him, and Lithgow and Halkett hit the long balls in a row.
The dead team could have had a greater advantage at the last minute, but McGregor took the net well and knocked out Jacobs' position before Lithgow got up from a corner.
In exchange for the Rangers, Glenn Middleton tried to fight another fourteen when he was confused with Jacobs, but Thomson hadn't been able to convince him.
Almanach: the inventor of the Geiger counter
A detail from our “Sunday Morning” almanac: September 30, 1882, now exactly 136 years ago... the day the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that could have led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger Counter has been one of the foundations of science ever since, and thanks to the film "Bells of Coronado" by strange cowboy scholars Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the 1950s: becoming part of pop culture.
Man: "What is this miracle?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter. Radioactive minerals, such as uranium, can be found with it.
"If you put this headphone on, you can hear the sound of atoms that are emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: “Listen to me, it’s pretty hot now!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, in his invention, he continues to live.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System To “See” Abnormal Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to “See” and Destroy Abnormal Cells
As part of a treatment, the vaccine will teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
It is part of the method that it is necessary to extract immune cells from the patient and then modify them in a laboratory.
This allows them to "see" the protein that accompanies many types of cancer. The treated immune cells are re-injected into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has achieved promising results in patients with different types of cancers.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal cells could say goodbye to ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is part of obtaining immune cells from the patient; modifying them in the laboratory to “seek” the protein called HER2, which is a common companion of multiple cancers; and then re-transplanting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the American National Cancer Research Institute (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “Our findings allow us to conclude that we have a very promising vaccine in our possession.”
HER2 "stimulates the growth of multiple types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and rectum cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, which is based on raising immune cells and “teaching” them how to attack cancer cells, has previously been used successfully in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
The role of Kanye West SNL, wearing the MAGA cap, culminated in a humiliating tyranny supporting Trump.
It didn't rinse too well
Kanye West was released in his Saturday Night Live studio after an unrelated speech in which he honoured U.S. President Donald Trump and later announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, in his cover of Make America Great Again, he began to speak out against the Democrats and re-emphasized his support for Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white person, he asks the question, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s racist?’
“If I was interested in racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show was opened by Matt Damon with a parody in which Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh mocked for his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual harassment charges.
Although it has not been broadcast, a video about West's vocabulary was uploaded by humorist Chris Rock on social media.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to get rid of the West by uploading it.
West even complained to the public that he was pissed behind the scenes because of his hat.
“They were frightened behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out in that hat.”
They scared me.
And they said I’m in the dungeon,” according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see a slumbered place? I'm going to take my Superman suit because that means they can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to progress?
Try it with love."
The demonstrations were accompanied by a whisper from the audience at least twice, and SNL actors apparently felt embarrassed, according to one witness who told Variety: "The whole studio was quietly engulfed."
West Ariana Grande was invited instead of singer at the last minute, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West asked questions when he performed the song "I Love It" in Perrier glass.
West, the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, tweeted: “One of the bravest ghosts: THEY KNOW HOW YOU ARE TRAINING THE PERSON.”
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, tweeted that West was simply “self, and that’s great.”
“But I have decided not to reward someone (by buying music or fashion items or by supporting ‘art’) who I think is an ideology that is harmful to the community that I am part of,” he said.
He's free.
“We too,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, now he is "the creature that was formerly known as Kanye West."
He wasn’t the first artist to change his name, and thus diddy’s footsteps, which we also know as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
His rapper partner, Snoop Dogg, also took the name Snoop Lion, and of course the late legend, Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist, formerly known as Prince.
The Belfast restaurant slayer is charged with attempted homicide
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was arrested at a restaurant in Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the case took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges are being reviewed by the Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the Star of the Battle of the Thrones, finds exaggerated masculinity harmful
Kit Harington is mostly known as the Battle of the Thrones Jon Snow, and in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, he often holds his sword.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke out against stereotypical cat heroes, pointing out that in the eyes of such heroes, young boys often feel that hard action is needed to fight out respect.
In a statement to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt “something wrong” and raised the question of how to deal with the problem of the harmful effects of excessive masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
The star, who recently married her 31-year-old serial colleague Rose Leslie, said she thought it would be very important to cure the problem.
“I am personally deeply touched by this case – how has the depiction of masculinity been so distorted?” the actor asked.
“What did we teach men in their childhood about the problem that we are now facing?”
According to Kit, television is also responsible for spreading the distorted image of masculinity, as the shows often feature very masculine characters.
He continued the thought: “What is born with us, and what are we learning?
What message do the street and TV give young boys that they feel like they can only be men in this way?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – and how we can change this.
'Cause it's clear that there's something wrong with the young men.'
Kit said in an interview that after the series' summer season's closure, he will not be featured in the series or sequels to "Thrones of War" because "he has the power of battleships and horses."
From November onwards, he will play a leading role in the reworking of Kit Sam Shepard's True West film, which is about a producer and his brother with a stealing lifestyle.
The actor told me that the best thing he got from the Battle of the Thrones was his wife, Rose, whom he met while making the series.
“I met my wife in the filming, so I can thank my future family and my life ahead of me for the series,” Kit said.
Rose Ygritte, who had a love for the character of Kit, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married a Scottish family owned by Leslie.
HIV/AIDS: China's number of new patients has increased by 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, this is more than 820,000 people affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, the number of cases reported increased by around 40,000.
Compared to the previous one, it is a change that the vast majority of newly infected people get the disease sexually.
The disease has been spread at a rapid rate with the spread of infected blood in some parts of China.
Health officials at a conference in Jinnan province, however, said that the number of such cases has declined to almost zero since then.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
The sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LMBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong ever since.
According to estimates from various studies, 70-90% of men who have sexual intercourse with other men eventually get married to women because of the country’s conservative value.
The disease in these relationships is spread in many cases due to inappropriate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been providing universal access to HIV medicines as part of a program aimed at solving the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her staff members had leaked data from Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected allegations that a member of her staff had released personal data from three Republican senators on the senators' Wikipedia page.
A Los Angeles Democrat spokeswoman said the allegations were circulated by “right-wing” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more subtle lies,” Waters wrote on Twitter.
The released information allegedly included South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, as well as the address and telephone number of Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information was posted on the internet on Thursday, and the publisher's personal name is unknown, but it is certain that they were published on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual harassment by Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The eviction occurred not long after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState are linked to Waters’ office as a source of IP address, and data have been released about a member of Waters’ staff.
“These allegations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously lie,” Waters continued.
– My staff member is not responsible for the leakage of information. However, the right to anonymity, protection of personal data and security has been violated as a result of fraud and false accusations.
“These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously lie.”
Waters’ statements were quickly criticized on the internet, including Ari Fleischer, the White House’s former press secretary.
“It’s an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
“Based on this, it seems that Waters does not have the blood temperature necessary for his office.
If someone is accused of something he hasn’t done, he can’t react to it in anger.
You can't be rude.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
You have to be calm and calm.”
Waters' reaction was apparently similar to his reaction to critics of Judge Kavanaugh's Democratic party, who some critics said seemed too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, who is running as a Republican candidate for Waters in the midterm elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s serious,” he wrote in his letter.
Waters said in a statement that his office had notified the "appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies" of the allegations.
“We make sure that the perpetrators’ personalities are found out, and that they are legally held liable for all acts that threaten or harm any member of our staff,” Waters said.
Johnny English is kicking again, or Rowan Atkinson's spy game
Now it has become a tradition to look for references to Brexit in all British films, and there is no exception to this, nor can the franchise, which runs under the name Johnny English, be included in the category of action game/parody, the first part of which will be titled Johnny English in 2003 and the second in 2011.
Will the new export product of the British nation become sarcastic, self-parodizing satires, in which we will live on our own, evident cult?
It’s so certain that Johnny English had enough guns for another comeback – it’s clear from his name that this comic character was created so that the masses of the world’s non-English-speaking countries could watch him in movies.
Johnny English, of course, is a hit secret agent who imagines himself to be victorious with his bizarre fashion, so it reminds a little of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and occasionally, of a guy with a single keyboard sticker on his back in 2012.
The character is originally based on the mysterious international traveler that Atkinson once played on a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV ad and left chaos everywhere.
There are a couple of good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved how Johnny English, dressed in a medieval armor, approached a helicopter, and then hitting the rotors on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson’s comedic vein is well-applied in the film, but the film’s humor doesn’t really work, and it actually works out of the way, because today, franchises with “full” sound recordings such as James Bond movies or the Mission Impossible series are also bravely touching this humour.
Feeling that the film’s humor is more targeted at children, and for me, Johnny English’s fluffy, left-handed adventures don’t reach the level of ingenuity and genius that Atkinson brings in the soft scenes of Mr. Bean’s series.
The starting point of the film is eternal: Great Britain is in serious danger.
A cybercriminal hacked into the super-secret online network of the British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents to the greatest horror of caring agent Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately only got such a small role in the film.
This may be the last corner in the cage of the insidious and divisive Prime Minister, whose political popularity is also in ruins: Emma Thompson is practically transformed by Theresa Mayt, and makes everything out of the otherwise poorly-written character.
Intelligence advisers tell him that since every active agent is identified with a light, he must put a calmed agent to work.
This retired agent, of course, is nothing more than two-legged Johnny English, who has been working as a teacher since his retirement in a prominent school, but unlike the curriculum, he teaches his children to spy – there are funny scenes here, of course.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where he meets his former, heavily suffering weapon carrier, Bough, whom Ben Miller is now transforming.
Since then, Bough has been married to a captain of a submarine whose mouth is always heard – Captain Vicki Pepperdine, who has been called for much better roles.
His Majesty's dubbed "Batman and Robin" pair of national security services then turns back into action and confronts Ophelia Bulletov, who is transformed by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko as a woman of real destiny.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is increasingly targeted by the charismatic IT billionaire, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s digital problems: his name is Jason Volta, and Jake Lacy is transformed.
English and Bough begin their bullshit mission: they set fire to a pucky French restaurant, dressed as a waitress, and then smuggled themselves into the luxury yacht of Volta in the middle of an astonishing twist, and English actually releases the hell when it comes to using a VR experience.
These stations are needed in order to get to the finish line, but no matter how fun and twisted it was, it may seem a little too much of a children's film.
The end result is quite mediocre.
As with all the other Johnny English movies, the question still arises to me: Could the British film industry finally give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talent?
The British Labour Party refuses to introduce a four-day week job while paying the British for a five-day job.
Jeremy Corbyn’s working party is working on a radical plan: introducing his four-day workforce, all so that workers would work for a five-day salary.
The party allegedly wants workers to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in such a way that company managers provide employees with extra free time thanks to their increased revenues.
According to the plan, workers would be given a three-day weekend while taking home the same amount as before.
According to the sources, the idea would be "fit" for the party's economic program, which aims to put on the side of the workers the language of the balance in the country.
The idea of the four-day workforce is also supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, which they believe can also benefit workers from the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told the Sunday Times: “The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not happen from one day to another, but the four-day workforce is an idea that fits well into the party's programme, which would push the workers towards the balance in the economy, and also fits into the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party has already campaigned for its four-day term in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
The idea, however, does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day workforce is not part of the party-supported policies, and the issue is not even on the agenda.”
The shadow finance minister John McDonnell presented the idea of a socialist revolution affecting the economy at last week’s Labour Conference.
McDonnell said he was fighting hard to regain power from “arctic directors” and “governors” of government firms.
If the plans of the Minister of Finance of the Shadow were realized, then the shareholders of the water supply companies would not get back the full profit of them, because a working-party government would provide “deductions” as a punishment for alleged harmful activities.
McDonnell also confirmed that it plans to make employees members of the Board of Directors and create Inclusive Ownership Funds, which could transfer 10% of the shares of companies operating in the private sector to employees who would receive <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy have told us in the 60 Minutes show that the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their minds.
As a result of the FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote on Kavanaugh's election as the Supreme Judge will be held at least a week later than the original date.Question that Kavanaugh's findings may be unfounded
In an interview on Sunday's 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something to think about.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” said Kennedy.
“I said that before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called after the case broke out, after the charges came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
The answer was clear and clear.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be concrete.
“I’ve already decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and they’re going to have to be extremely serious charges to change my mind,” Graham said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know that Brett has denied the allegations,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people named by Dr. Ford have proved the charges.
It's a 36-year story.
I don’t think anything new will happen.”
What is the Global Citizens’ Festival, and has it been able to mitigate poverty?
The annual music event, the Global Citizens Festival, begins on Saturday in New York City, where world stars rise to stand up for a truly noble goal: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival will now be held seven times and is expected to host tens of thousands of Central Park’s Grand Festival, where participants can not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also draw the attention to the event’s 20th anniversary.
The Global Citizens Festival was first organized in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is run by an international group of stakeholders aimed at eradicating poverty by attracting more people to actively combat poverty.
You can get a free ticket to the concert (unless you are willing to pay even for a VIP ticket) to perform certain tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a leader, a project call, or at least another call.
But how successful has the Global Citizen actually been in the past 12 years in achieving the goals set?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with concert tickets for convincing others about the importance of action, or is it just another form of so-called “clickivism” when people feel like they’ve been decently contributing to a case on Twitter?
Since 2011, according to the Global Citizens’ data, more than 19 million “actions” have been carried out by the project’s supporters, who served a number of different purposes.
According to the organization, these actions have contributed to allocating <0x24>37 billion to poverty policies and commitments that could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group claimed 390 commitments and announcements that their actions have been made, of which <0x24>10 billion has already been paid out or collected during donations.
The group estimates that the money raised has had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between investors and executives based in the United Kingdom that aims to “help children reach more than 700 million Twitter shares of their potential.” The organization’s <0x24>35 million for <0x24>4 worth of donations from Twitter.
“With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, as well as donors, national governments and citizens like you, we can extinguish social injustices and malnutrition among the footnotes of the history books.
The group also claims that after more than 5,000 actions have been called upon by the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has allocated resources to the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the nutrition of 5 million women and children.
Frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen’s website are: “Why do you think poverty can be overcome?”
According to the Global Citizen, “There will be a long and difficult journey where we will sometimes stand and sometimes fail.
But like the previous anti-civil and anti-segregation movements, we are achieving our goal because together we are stronger.”
Among others, Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae will also perform at this year’s New York event, and the show hosts Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Home Secretary: U.S. naval “block” to prevent Russian energy exports
“If necessary,” Washington would even introduce the navy against the evasion of Russian energy carriers to the market, so that, for example, Russian energy could not reach the Middle East,” US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke quoted the Washington Examiner as saying.
Zinke said Russia’s active presence in Syria – especially in the case of Russian operations at the legitimate request of the Syrian government – was just a reason for Russia to acquire new energy markets for itself.
“I think they’re only there in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe,” Zinke said in a statement.
And according to the interior minister, there are methods to prevent the Russians.
“The United States is able to ensure that the naval routes are open and can be blocked if necessary, so that it can ensure that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” Zinke said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of a non-profit event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance – the non-profit group defines itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
In his speech, Washington compared his actions against Russia and Iran and noted that these are practically the same methods.
“Iran and Russia can be economically sanctioned almost the same way: by using existing energy carriers and introducing new ones,” Zinke said, calling Russia a “one-dimensional economy,” pointing to the country’s lack of fossil energy.
The statements are consistent with the Trump administration’s plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus removing Russia from the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
That’s why the Trump administration’s senior officials, including the president himself, are convincing Germany to defeat the North Stream 2 cable project, which, if implemented, will make Moscow a “new” Germany.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline is an exclusively economic project that doubles its existing capacity, raising it to 110 billion cubic meters.
According to the Kremlin, Washington strongly opposes the project for economic reasons, which is a manifestation of unfair competition.
“I assume that we are in the same position that energy should not be used for pressure, and that consumers should be given the opportunity to freely choose their suppliers,” said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak, a spokesman for energy Rick Perry.
The Americans’ attempts to persuade the Germans were backwards as Germany reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Association (BDI), has urged the US not to interfere in EU energy policy, as it does with the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I consider it a problem when a third state intervenes in our energy affairs,” said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the German Industry Association (BDI), after the last meeting between Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren “takes great consideration” to step down for presidency in 2020
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the midterm elections, she would “take a lot of consideration” to step down for the presidency.
Warren, in Massachusetts, at a city meeting in Hollywood, confirmed that he was considering leaving.
“The idea is that women get into Washington and restore the malfunctioning government, and it’s time for a woman to be president,” Warren told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I’m seriously considering starting for the presidency.”
At the city assembly, Warren criticized Donald Trump and said he thought he was “guiding the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” Warren said.
Warren has criticised Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the highest court nominee.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course, there is a need for FBI investigation before voting.”
However, according to a poll published on Thursday, most of Warren’s Massachusetts voters don’t think Warren should run for presidency in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University’s Political Analysis Center and the Boston Globe poll, 58% of Massachusetts voters who voted for Warren are “good chances” that the Senator should not run for the presidency.
32% support Warren's presidential nomination.
According to the survey, Deval Patrick’s former presidential nominee would be supported by the majority of respondents, 38% would be in favour and 48% would be in opposition.
In the 2020 presidential election, the names of top rank Democratic politicians, such as former vice president Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, have emerged.
According to a report by the Associated Press, Biden will decide if he will leave in January.
Sarah Palin Track Referred to Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's Meeting
26-year-old Track Palin served for one year in Iraq after applying in September
On Monday night, he was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
“As my son is going through what he has been through since he returned home, I understand the other families who have experienced the horrific consequences of PTSD and the injuries our soldiers are coming home with,” said Sarah Palin, a spokeswoman for the public in Donald Trump, Oklahoma.
He called the arrest of Palin's son "the elephant in the room" and said that his son, like the other veterans of war, "came back, hardened, and walked back in his head all the time, whether he was a member of the staff, his bag, his bag, and his other service."
Track Palin was arrested in Wasila, Alaska on charges of domestic violence against a woman. Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police in Wasila, said that Track Palin was reported to have been murdered in his family with a gun.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support judicial review of asylum policy
Eighteen states and Washington D.C. also support the review of the new U.S. refugee policy, according to which those who are fleeing violence by gangs or within their families will not be eligible for asylum.
Representatives from 18 different states, as well as Washington, D.C., wrote an expert letter in Washington on Friday to support a asylum seeker who is attacking politics in court.
The full name of the appellant of Grace vs. Sessions, who was initiated against federal policy by the U.S. Civil Law Union in August, was not disclosed.
The woman claimed that her partner and “the sons of her violent crime gang” had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
The prosecutors of the Grace-supporting states have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as places where many of the asylum attempts made to the United States are originating, because in these countries there is a continuing problem with the crimes committed and incurred.
A 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA) to revoke the new U.S. refugee policy, according to which immigrants without documents have been evacuated from domestic violence.
Karl Racine, D.C. Attorney General, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "supposes decades of state, federal and international law."
“Under federal law, all asylum claims must be assessed according to the facts and circumstances in place, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the letter reads.
The prosecutors also stated in the letter that immigration-refusing policies are damaging to the U.S. economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “fill the lowest levels of jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions urged asylum-seekers not to give asylum to victims of domestic violence and crime-escaped crimes.
“The right of asylum applies to those who leave the country because of race, religious reasons, national filiation, membership of a particular social group, or political conviction, or because of a justified fear of persecution,” said Sessions’ 11th Session of Politics.
The right of asylum has not been invented to solve all the problems of people around the world that arise on a daily basis, no matter how serious they may be.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu, the number of deaths doubled, rescue creatures race over time
The situation of the survivors is becoming more and more prospective.
“Everyone is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she calms a feverish boy in one of Palu’s evacuation centers.
The ambulances bring the bodies every minute.
We barely have a drink."
Some of the residents returned to their homes to rescue them from all the dirty things that could still be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, which were also damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were not able to supply people.
Some of the injured, including the fractured spine and shoulder Dwi Harist, were transported to the Palui Katonian Hospital, where the patients were seen outside the hospital building due to heavy aftershocks.
The man’s eyes were filled with tears when he wondered how the fifth-floor hotel room, in which his wife and daughter were occupied, was plunged into the devastating uprising.
“There was no time to escape.
“I think I was forced into the fallen walls,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Propaganda Advertising
The U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the U.S. press. This happened a week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a quadruple advertisement in a U.S. newspaper that spoke about U.S.-China trade relations.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to an advertisement in the China Daily Des Moines Register – the largest newspaper in Iowa – while accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6th U.S. Congressional elections.
Trump accuses Beijing of trying to interfere in the U.S. election, according to Reuters officials, a new phase in Washington’s increasingly strong action against China, aimed at putting China under pressure.
While it is not uncommon for foreign governments to promote trade with their country through advertising, there is an increasingly intense trade war between Beijing and Washington, during which new and new tariffs are imposed on each other’s import products.
According to US and Chinese experts at the beginning of the trade war, the tariffs imposed as a response by the Chinese have attempted to target exporters from countries where Trump and the Republican Party are popular, for example in Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, who served for several cycles, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and shops, because the state of Iowa would export a significant amount of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in an article published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that “China is further haunting our country by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“The Chinese government is taking advantage of the highly esteemed American tradition of freedom of speech and press by spreading propaganda in paid advertisements on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“However, if we go to a Beijing newspaper, we hardly find critically sound articles. The Chinese press at all does not faithfully reflect the opinions of the Chinese people that are different, that are different from each other, the Chinese economy’s increasingly burgeoning anti-communist prospects of growth,” he said.
Branstad added that "one of China's most famous newspapers was not willing to take down" the article, but did not name the newspaper.
Analysts say Republicans could ban women voters from Kavanaugh voters before midterm elections
Analysts believe that many high-ranking Republican politicians are defending the top court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, at the crossroads of sexual harassment charges.
The case sparked intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly declared that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
“These statements cannot be retrieved,” said Grant Reeher, a political scientist at the University of Sicily’s Maxwell School, in a Saturday article at The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last-minute FBI investigation proposed by Republican Senator Jeff Flake in Arizona would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — neither tomorrow nor November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, head advisor and national spokeswoman for MoveOn, according to a Washington, D.C. newspaper.
According to Mic, some protesters in the Senate corridor on Friday morning chanted, “November is coming!” because despite the Republican-controlled Justice Committee’s confession, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, has decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s appointment.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will jump dramatically,” said independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg.
“A lot of people say it’s been so high, and that’s true.
But it can be even higher, especially among out-of-town uncertain women voters and young people (18-29 years old) who, although not enthusiastic about the president, often don’t go to vote.
Analysts have already assumed before Ford's public confession that it could strike back on Republicans if they continue to stand by Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. Since then, Ford has detailed in detail why he accuses sexual harassment.
“The Republican Party was wrong on the ground,” former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the commission vote and the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is appointed, it’s about how Republicans handled the case and how they behaved with Ford,” said Guy Cecil, a Democrat who helped vote.
However, it seems that the Americans are fairly divided on whether Ford or Kavanaugh's statement is true. Kavanaugh is a little more believed than Ford.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believed Ford’s statement entirely or rather, and 35% of respondents gave the same answer at Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of respondents said Kavanaugh probably lied about his confession, while only 30% of Ford’s respondents believed it.
Due to Flake's motion, the FBI is currently investigating the credibility of Ford's claims, as Kavanaugh's other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, writes the Guardian.
A week ago, Ford was sworn in to the Senate Judiciary Committee that at the age of 17, Kavanaugh had harassed him drunk.
According to Ramirez, the supreme court nominee showed her the genitals at a party in the 1980s, when they both studied at Yale.
World Wide Web Inventor to Launch New Internet to Counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup with the goal of launching the competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solidra, the latest project of the tech legend.
With Soliddal, users can choose where they want to store their data and who has access to the individual information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt was “to acquire the dominant power over the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
With Solid technology, the app allows people to create their own "personal online data warehouse", also known as POD.
It can include lists, action lists, calendars, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available from the same browser at the same time.
In the online personal data warehouse, it is unique that the user can fully decide who can access your data.
The company calls this the "exercise of the right of self-determination over personal data".
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the company’s task is to provide the resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few contract developers involved in the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt page.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team are not asking “Facebook and Google to introduce the technology that brings full change, which from one day to the next would put the company’s business models at the top entirely.”
“We don’t ask permission from them.”
In a post published by Mediumon on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is “providing commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the Solidra newly built network.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts University of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been involved in debates over the internet’s neutrality in recent months as an important opinion maker.
Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute despite the launch of Inrupt.
“I am infinitely optimistic about the next era of the global network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann was celebrated as a priest serving in the First World War.
It is the only English-born city to have received the Victorian Cross, celebrating 100 years after the execution of his heroism in World War I.
Honourable and Colonel Bernard Vann was honoured during the September 29, 1918 attacks in Belenglise and Lehacourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a master gunner, so he never knew he deserved the highest honour of the British Armed Forces.
Two of his grandchildren floated a memorial stone in honor of him at a Saturday celebration in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "symbolically significant" that the memorial stone was handed over exactly 100 years after his grandfather's honorable act.
According to the London Gazette, Reverend Bernard Vann passed his flag on the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, "in the midst of a dense fog and heavy gun and machine gun fire."
Later, he stepped on the line and stood at the front of the flag, with “exceptional heroism,” and then attacked a camp cannon unit on his own, depriving three members of it.
Reverend Bernard Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
“I know I can never get to what my grandfather did, and that taught me humility,” said 72-year-old Michael Vann.
After a retreat by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, forced the memorial.
Michael Vann said he feels honored to have played a role in the ceremony, and then added, “The dishonesty of a true hero is evidenced by how many will express their respect to him later.”
MMA fans have been pushed all night to watch the Bellator 206 broadcast, instead of Peppa's puppy
Imagine that you've been busy all night watching the exciting Bellator 206, and that's what the mediation is missing.
The San José show featured 13 clashes, six of which were broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5 as part of the main racing show.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, Peppa came to the show instead of a little surprise for the English viewers.
This has made it difficult for many of those who, because of the clash, remained up until the morning hours.
One of the fans called the children’s cartoon “some sick joke” instead of the MMA game on Twitter.
“According to state regulations, such content can no longer be broadcast on the channel at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of Bellator’s communications and marketing department.
"Yes, it's Peppa's time."
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, has promised that in the future, the program will be revised to include viewers in the UK.
“I think we can solve the problem by repeating it,” Coker said.
“However, since there are 6 a.m. on Sundays, until Sundays according to our time, which is Monday, we cannot cure the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when you switched on the show, a lot of messages came in, and so most weren't really friendly.
At first we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix the error.
But it wasn’t about this, it was a legal problem.
However, I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
There will be only five games on the show, instead of the six so far – we really wanted to do it for the spectators, but we accounted for ourselves.
It was an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley Fights With a Minority Complex for Sexual Attitude
At the Olympics, artist Tom Daley stated that he felt inferior to everyone at a young age because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
According to the 24-year-old athlete, he didn’t even notice until high school that “not everyone is” like him.
On the radio show Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, Lauren Laverne said she stood up for gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He added that since he was a parent, he has been much less interested in the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent director of the long-lived show, has missed several months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley called him "a shipwreck" and said that as a young man he felt "less" because he "was socially unacceptable if someone loved both boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, the feeling of inferiority and differentness is the one from which I measure endurance and strength in order to achieve my success.”
He wanted to prove that he deserves “something” so as not to disappoint everyone when light comes to his sexual orientation.
The double-bronze olympic artist has become a well-known representative of the LMBT community and, taking advantage of his performance at this year’s international international games in Australia, has asked world governments to decriminalize him in as many countries as possible.
He said he was speaking because he felt lucky that he could live his life openly, without negative consequences, and he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said he was “completely surprised” when he fell in love with another man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley and his 20-year-old Oscar-winning screenwriter married last year, and said the age difference had never been a problem between them.
“If a man goes through so many things at a young age,” he said – when he was 14 years old at the first Olympics, and his father died three years later from cancer – he finds it difficult to find someone in his own age who has experienced similarly extreme experiences.
In June, the couple adopted a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, who, according to Daley's own confession, completely changed his attitude towards the world.
“If you asked me this question last year, I would have said the most important thing is to win a gold coin,” he said.
“But you know what I found out? There are things more important than my Olympic gold.
It's my Olympic gold medal, Robbie."
The child's name was named after Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t want to accept that he was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether he had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I was unable to answer him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be in the first row anymore,’” he said.
“I held her hand when she stopped breathing, but until then I couldn’t accept that my father was invulnerable,” she said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I felt that this is what I’ve dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of my home audience at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling than that,” he said.
Heather Small Proud (Büszke) has helped her a lot during the Olympic preparations, and she will still be lilac-skinned to this day if she hears it.
Desert Island Discs starts on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. local time.
Mickelson wasn't in shape, and he was a little boy at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson can set a record by taking part in the 47th Cup match at the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he has to regain his form if he doesn’t want this milestone to remain in his memory as an unpleasant experience.
Mickelson plays for the 12th time in the record-setting event every two years, but for his performance in Saturday's four races and four games, team captain Jim Furyk sent him to the little boy.
Instead of being the centerpiece of events in the big races, as often as you had to fight for the victory of the United States, one half of the day the team is playing, the other half is playing with the practice of playing, playing and playing.
At the peak of his career, he has never been one of the most accurate hitters, so the 48-year-old is not really on the narrow track of Le Golf National, where due to the high grass he has to pay a very high price for faulty hits.
And if the track itself wasn’t scary enough, Mickelson on Sunday, the ninth match will be faced by the exact-playing English champion Francesco Molinari, who won all four games this week with Tommy Fleetwood in the starting squad.
If the Americans who start with a four-point draw before 12 individual matches start strongly, then Mickelson's match can be crucial.
Furyk says he trusts the player, but what else could he say?
“He’s fully aware of his role in today’s development. He rubbed his back, crossed his legs, and promised that he’d be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
- Extremely confident.
He’s one of the biggest and he’s done a lot for the team in the past and in the past week.
Basically, I didn't have two games for him.
I planned more, but in that particular situation, we decided that this was the best solution.
He wants to be on the pitch, just like everyone else.”
With Mickelson’s performance on Sunday, Nick Faldo will break the record, with no one playing more games in the Ryder Cup.
With this, you can close a series on the Ryder Cup that is far from the player’s individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven indecisive, but Furyk said that the presence of a veteran player has inconceivable advantages for the team.
“It’s funny, it’s sarcastic, it’s clever, it likes to joke with others, it’s a great team member,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed the games they played against him, and it’s good to see that.
Its presence goes beyond the game in the strict sense."
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the captain of the European team, is aware that they can easily lose their gained advantage
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if someone comes in with a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, they can easily turn their backs on their luck.
The Danish player first appeared in a 1997 Valderrama match, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros gained a five-point advantage against the Americans, and then in the end they just managed to keep a streak of advantage for the 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 weight.
“We always have to remind ourselves that we lost a big advantage in Valderrama, yet we won only with a haircut, and we also had a big advantage in Brookline, where we finally got out,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn at the 2018 class of golf at the 10th–6th round of the National Golf Championships and the 5–3th round.
“We’re thinking about the races of the previous years, and everyone can see that the game isn’t over yet.
You have to play with full force tomorrow.
So let's come and do everything you need to win.
We can't relax until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, which is nothing but to win this trophy, and that is the only thing we need to focus on now.
"As I said before, I'm mostly dealing with the 12 players on our team, but we have to look at the other side, which is one of the biggest players in the world."
Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, proud of the team’s performance on the difficult track, added: “I would never give up on predictions in such a situation.
Tomorrow's a completely different day.
Then everything depends on the individual performances, which is completely different from the team game.
It’s a great feeling to play in pairs when things go well, but when you stand out individually, it turns out in every way that you really are a golfer.
This should be understood by the players to bring the best out of their course tomorrow.
They have to break away from their partner, who will also have to take the best form.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, expressly trusts that his players will perform better individually than in pairs, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of the four.
Furyk personally said he had experienced both sides of the last-day uprisings: he was a member of the winning team in Brookline, and then he was on the losing side after the brave performance of the European team called the "medinah miracle".
“I remember every damn word,” he said when asked about it, “because it encouraged the players the last day before the team captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we’re going to start as fast as we’ve seen in Brookline, as we’ve seen in Medinah.
If one of the teams really gets involved, it puts a lot of pressure on the opponent's players during the midfield matches.
"We have compiled the order accordingly, and we have prepared our players so that they can perform a real miracle tomorrow."
Thomas was given the assignment to be at the forefront of the effort to reverse the position, and Rory McIlroy plays against the first game, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the first half of the European team.
“I also decided to follow the order because I think that’s how the picture works from the beginning to the end,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added.
Germany’s newest warship has been deferred again
The German navy’s latest frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the age-old Cold War warships, but due to various system failures and exponentially rising costs, this is still at least for the next year.
The flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate, the Rheinland-Pfalz, was postponed for the first half of 2019, the Die Zeit weekly reported, citing a spokesman for the army.
The ship was originally planned to join the navy in 2014, but the continuing delays made the fate of the large-scale project very difficult.
In 2007, the Navy commissioned four Baden-Württemberg-class ships to replace the Bremen-class ageing frigates.
We know that it will have a large fire cannon and will be equipped with various anti-aircraft and watercraft missiles and coating technology, including a signal buffer that will reduce the ship's radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that it requires less maintenance, which in practice means that these newest frigates can be put in service for up to two years away from the mother ports.
However, due to the continuous sliding of the project, these state-of-the-art warships, with which Germany could feel its power overseas, may already become obsolete when they are finally put into service, Die Zeit noted.
The heavy-duty F125 frigate was launched last year when the German navy officially refused to assign the vehicle and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the navy sent a ship back to the manufacturer.
There has been little information about the reasons for the return, but German media mentions several critical “software and hardware errors” that render the warship useless for a combat operation.
Software deficiencies are a very significant problem, as only 120 sailors will serve on the warships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which is only half of the crew of the old Bremen class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship was extremely overweight, which undermines its performance and makes it impossible for the navy to make further amendments at a later date.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is said to be twice as heavy as German-made class ships in World War II.
In addition to the faulty components, the increase in the total cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an astonishing amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion), while the initial project was estimated at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the new frigates are of particular importance in light of the warnings that Germany’s maritime presence is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, the chairman of the German parliament’s National Defence Committee, recently acknowledged that the navy “begins to deprive itself of the warships that are in their own state.”
In the meantime, the problem has become a self-explanatory process, as the old ships had to be dismantled, but there are no more ships to replace the ships.
He expressed concern that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the navy.
The National Trust is investigating the secret lives of deniers.
A new research is underway on a Scottish-country estate, aimed at exploring how foxes use the characteristics of the landscape during hunting.
The researchers hope that the findings will provide new information on the behaviour of unique flying mammals, which may also be useful for future breeding initiatives.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will examine the behavior of common and soprano dwarfs, as well as brown long-haired dwarfs and water dwarfs in the Inverewe Garden area of Wester Ross.
At the appropriate points of the area, special recording devices are placed to record the activities of the rodents during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will be able to collect mobile data with manual detectors.
A detailed analysis of the sound content of the recordings allows you to determine the frequency of the denoted sounds and what kind of sound they are doing.
Researchers will also create a habitat map and report, which will help to determine in detail how the behavior of animals develops depending on the landscape.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will reveal which are the most important habitats for rodents and which species to use.
This information will help determine the beneficial effects of habitat management works, such as the formation of grasslands, and how forest areas can be best preserved for deer and other affected species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the size of dengue populations has declined significantly over the past century.
Construction and area development work disrupts the sleeping places of animals and reduces their living standards.
Wind turbines and public lighting are a risk factor for them, as are certain chemical procedures used for the construction materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The ants aren't really completely blind.
However, because of our nighttime predators, they rely much more on their hearing when hunting predators than on their sight.
With their sophisticated ultrasound-reflective technique, they can determine the exact location of the insects and the terrain objects entering their path.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the issue of deer very seriously.
They work with ten skilled professionals who regularly prepare studies and sleep exams, and sometimes take part in rescue work.
The organization has created Scotland’s first and only dedicated deer reserve on the Threave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten deer species.
David Thompson said the area is the ideal habitat for dwarfs.
“Here, in Threave, the deer have a great place,” he said.
“There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that is needed for a good living space.
But we still don’t know much about the foxes, and thanks to their work here and in other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel great.”
He also stressed how important it is to make sure before the renovation of the buildings whether there are deer living there, as the destruction of a single settlement could result in the destruction of 400 women and young singles, which could lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
The protection, destruction, harassment and habitat of protected animals by molluscs is prohibited by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, also asked for help from the public.
“There’s still a lot we don’t know about rodents, and we don’t have much information about the status of most domestic species.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of sexual harassment, lawsuits filed against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the accusations of sexual violence against him “fake news” and said others wanted to use his name to “avoid public awareness.”
The footballer's lawyers are ready to press charges against the German weekly Der Spiegel.
A member of the Portuguese board and the Juventus Battalion were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the woman, the athlete paid her <0x24>375,000 to hear about the case, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo told 142 million fans in an Instagram Live video a few hours after the allegations were evaded.
“No, no, no, no and no.
"What they've come up with about me today is all a lie," the five-time gold-ball player told the camera.
“They want to use my name to get into public awareness.
That's what it's like.
They want to be famous with my name, that's the life of public figures.
I’m a happy person and my life is fine,” he added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to endorse Der Spiegel because of the allegations they call “an unacceptable, privacy-infringing suspicion.”
According to lawyer Christian Schertz, the player will file a claim for damages “to the extent that moral damages are caused are proportional to the severity of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in one of the suites of the Las Vegas Palms hotel and casino.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went up to the sportsman's suite, where the man raped a woman analically, says in documents filed with the Clark County District Attorney's Office.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told him he was “99 percent good boy” with “one percent”.
Based on the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo admitted that he had sexual relations with the woman, but said it was all done with the same consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police, and in a hospital she made an appearance of her injuries, but later entered into an out-of-court agreement because she was "fearful of revenge" and "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman now wants to revoke the agreement, as the trauma caused by the incident in question continues to haunt her life.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was in the process of transferring (from Real Madrid to Manchester United) and this summer the Italian giant, Juve, bought the player for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: the UK 'will regret forever' the loss of car factories
The UK will "forever regret" if it loses its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota UK is “concerned” about the BBC’s statement that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, the car factory will be forced to temporarily stop production at a gas station near Derby.
“There’s a deal,” Clark said.
According to the Japanese automaker, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, jobs could be cut due to delays at the borders.
The company, which manufactures the models Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I see that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production cuts at the factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers operating in the UK (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also expressed concerns about the possibility of the country leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Car manufacturers are most concerned that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, risks arise in relation to the supply chain.
Toyota’s factory operates on a “timely” basis, the components arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the UK and other EU countries.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, then the interference at the borders could lead to production delays and a lack of parts, according to industry representatives.
According to Toyota, it would be impossible to store enough spare parts for more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, which is why production should be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May Chequers’ plan for future relations with the EU is “exactly designed to avoid delayed checks at the border.”
“We want to reach an agreement on the best possible terms that will not only benefit from our current successes, but also offer new opportunities,” he said in the BBC Radio 4 Today show.
“Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers can confirm that we absolutely need to maintain our outstandingly successful supply chain at the moment.”
Toyota was not able to say how long production would last, but warned that combining costs could damage the factory’s competitiveness in the long run, which could eventually result in job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked for 24 years at the Burnaston plant and is currently working in the Unite trade union, the union members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, we will never get jobs that stop at this time.”
A government spokesman said: "We have developed a precise and feasible plan for future EU ties."
Trump and Rosenstein’s meeting could be postponed again, the White House said.
"A further week may be postponed" for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump's big horde of meetings as the debate on top court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said in a statement.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian influence on the election, the potential ties between Trump’s advisers and the Russian government, and the possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
For months in Washington, it has been found whether Trump will finally escape the deputy chief prosecutor, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence.
According to the New York Times this month, Rosenstein considered coming to the meeting tricky to record a conversation with the president, and also raised the question of whether there would be a possibility of Trump’s resignation under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied what he said.
Last week, however, he visited the White House, and there was a speech to file for his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, which was then in front of the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he was “not happy” to insult Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so as not to clash with the Senate Justice Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who suspected him of sexual crime, Dr. Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation to investigate charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the decisive Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made a visit to Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he replied: “We have no appointment date yet, and we can put it this week, but in the light of the cases taking place in the Supreme Court, I see a chance for another weekly delay.
Soon it will be revealed, and I will, as always, notify the press.”
However, some journalists have been reluctant to accept this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the director of the show, also asked why.
Sanders replied that the rarity of press conferences was not the reason for the anti-sensitivity of television reporters over the behavior of "sensation hairstyles", but added, "I do not dispute the fact that I really feel sensation hairstyles."
He later pointed out that direct meetings between Trump and the media will be held more frequently.
“The president gives more interviews to the questioners than any previous president,” he said, adding, without substantiating the claim: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to raise questions directly to the President of the United States, with the light years, it is better than if they spoke to me.
“We have often tried to get around this, and in the past few weeks, there have been many such events, so instead of White House press conferences, they can talk to the President of the United States in person.”
Trump regularly responds to journalists’ questions when he leaves the White House, or attends public events, perhaps press conferences with the merits of the visitor.
However, press conferences held on their own are quite rare.
Why, maybe we can conclude from what happened this week, when the president was in New York, where he made a bizarre appearance in front of the journalists gathered.
The head of the health portfolio sent a letter to NHS Scotland’s European Union workers over Brexit concerns
In a letter, the head of the health portfolio thanked Scotland’s NHS staff from EU countries and said he hoped they would stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK's expected departure.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs associated with the application for legal status of EU citizens who work in a decentralised public service.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Negotiations on the exit between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued during the summer, which are expected to bring about a decision in the autumn.
The Government of the United Kingdom has also contributed to the preparation of a possible non-agreement scenario.

Christion Abercrombie was undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation after a 31–27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to Mike Organ Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-life.
“He climbed to the shoreline and just collapsed,” Reed said.
The coaching team and the health staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the track, then put it on a barge and took him to further examinations.
A Tennessee State official in Nashville, Tennessee, told Chris Harris, a WSMV reporter, that Abercrombie is beyond the surgery that was performed at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no further details at the moment about the type and extent of the injury," while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the one-year-relaxed second-year student, spends his first season at Tennessee State, where he passes from Illinois.
He presented a total of five successful installments on Saturday before leaving the track, so he is already at 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees after real estate purchases in the UK.
According to Toryk’s new plan, foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees on properties purchased in the UK, and the surplus income will support homeless people.
With this step I would neutralize Corbyn's success among young voters
Increased taxation is aimed at those who are not taxed in the UK
According to the State Treasury, this would mean annual revenues of <0xC2><0xA3>120 million, which would be spent on support for homeless people.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees after properties purchased in the UK, and the surplus income from this will be used to support homeless people, Theresa May will announce at a press conference today.
The goal of the move is probably to counterbalance the successes achieved by young voters by Jeremy Corbyn, which he has achieved by promising more affordable housing and high-income measures.
The increase in the taxation will affect individuals and companies who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, and the resulting surplus income will be used to combat homelessness.
An additional fee in addition to the current duty, which can be exceeded by up to three per cent of the higher fees imposed on the second apartments or properties purchased for expenditure two years ago.
The State Treasury expects a revenue of <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year as a result of the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s newly built properties are bought by citizens outside the UK, causing a significant price rise, which makes the situation of the first home buyers increasingly difficult.
Many of the country's county's wealthy districts have become a "spirit city", especially in the capital, as many foreign buyers spend much of their time outside the country.
The new bill came just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a tax cut to help young people who are preparing to wait for their first home.
He personally considers the construction companies responsible for keeping the property prices high, which has become the habit of buying and leaving the land. He asked Mayt to abolish the quotas for affordable homes and to start a "market" in the country.
Corbyn made remarkable proposals for a series of housing reforms, including the elimination of rent control and the elimination of unreasonable exclusions.
In addition, it will provide more jurisdiction and opportunities for councils to build new houses.
May said: “Last year I said that I wanted to dedicate my prime ministerial office to the restoration of the English dream and to making life better for every generation.
To do this, we need to address the real estate market situation.
Britain remains, as always, open to those who want to live, work and start a family.
However, it is not right for individuals living outside the country, as well as foreign-interested companies, to buy properties as easily as hard-working English nationals.
Too many dreams of their own home have become almost inaccessible to many, and the state of homelessness has become too inaccessible."
Jack Ross: "I want to be the manager of the Scottish team"
According to Sunderland coach Jack Ross, “the main desire” is to be the manager of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would be happy to take on the challenges of reviving the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the first-class league, with only three points behind the first place.
He then transferred his seat to Stadium of Light after successfully bringing the St. Mirren team back to the first-class Scottish football championship last season.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
"Unfortunately, I only managed to get into the reserves," Ross said on the BBC Sportssound in Scotland.
“When I was a kid, I watched a lot of Scottish team play in Hampden with my dad, and there was always something coming back to them.
But now I only have a chance to succeed as a club manager.”
The Sunderland managers include Ross' predecessors Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former coach was not thrilled that he had to go in the footsteps of such great names, and had previously rejected the offer of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"I'm going to measure the success right now if I can bring the team back to the first class.
If we take the structure and facilities of the club, it will undoubtedly be in the first-class league,” he said.
“It won’t be easy to come back, but it’s more than likely that I will only be successful if I get back to the club.”
Ross’s managerial career began just three years ago after serving as a deputy coach for a while at Dumbarton and spent 15 months in Hearts’ coaching yard.
Then it helped Aolla to get back to the ground after the team returned to third-class, and with St. Mirren on the edge of the run the following season he won the championship title.
Ross says he feels more confident now than ever in his playing career, whether he is at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academic.
“It was a really decisive moment,” he recalled as coach of Alloa.
“I clearly thought that management was for me rather than being a player.
That sounds weird, because I did a good job, quite well in my life, and in fact, I had some really memorable moments.
However, the players’ lives are sometimes very difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every blessed week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the stress and pressure involved in the work, but the management tasks lie with me.
I’ve always been interested in management, and now that I’ve experienced it, I feel the best in my skin now that I’m an adult.”

According to a study, beer falls best at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon.
During the summer heatwave, the traffic of British pubs in a difficult situation has increased significantly, but there is still a lot of pressure on the restaurant chains.
According to the data collected, the revenue of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the revenue of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, an employee of the CGA business advisory company that compiled the statistics, said: “Thanks to the sunny season and the longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Championships, the trend of the previous month may have continued to be even higher than the previous month, with more than 2.8% of the pub’s revenues being higher than expected.
Revenue declines of 1.8% in restaurants in June further deteriorated in July.
Pubs and bars, which mainly sell alcohol, were the best performers, which had a higher rate of growth than even in restaurants.
Even the pubs that offer more food were unpleasantly affected by the lasting sun, although not nearly as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
Apparently, people prefer to drink at this time.
Income from pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% this month, and revenue from food fell by 3%.
According to Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in the leisure and hospitality industry: “These results are following a downward trend since the end of April.
The weather, as well as major community and sporting events, continue to be the main revenue factor in the entertainment and hospitality industry.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains are in a difficult position, and a 4.8% annual revenue drop can be particularly painful due to ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have been worse for restaurant operators, and it will only be revealed with time whether the more moderate weather experienced in August will bring relief in this area as well."
The total revenue growth of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened venues, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow pace of the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors the sales of the UK's hospitality industry (pubs, bars and restaurants), is a widely accepted industrial grader, with a total volume of more than 9 billion, a total capacity of 47 members and a total of 47 employees.
One in five children has a social media account that they hide from their parents.
According to a survey, one in five children (even at the age of 11) have a social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta pages” is increasing
Increased fear of sharing sexual content has been reported.
20% of students answered that they have a “master” account that their parents can see.
One in five children (even at the age of 11) create a social media account that they hide from adults.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta Accounts” is rapidly increasing, referring to Instagram’s photo sharing page.
As a result of the news, there is a growing fear of sharing sexual content.
20% of students answered that they have an unmistakable “master” account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally found her on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenage profile on which she said, "You're going to rape her."
According to a study by the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), which represents the directors and directors of independent schools and the UK, 40% of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, and 50% of them have private accounts.
“I find it worrying that so many teens feel like they need to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t reach them,” HMC chief Mike Buchanan said in a statement.
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” in the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Association at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle, Scotland's most successful athlete and chairman of the board, Ian Beattie, said he would be of invaluable help to sports decision makers from the athlete's extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has a great reputation in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community, and its presence will help the development of Scottish athletics,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m happy to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope I can really help the work of Scottish sports drivers.”
Two of the four Olympic gold coins of the American athlete, who regularly spoke on the BBC, were awarded at the 1996 Atlantic Olympics in 200 metres and 400 metres, but were forced into a wheelchair due to a temporary brain disorder.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it would take some time to see if I could recover at all.
With a man trying work, but I managed to completely recover, I can walk again, I am going to agility training today!
“Thank you for your encouraging message.”
Breast Suction Advertising Like Cows Shares the Online Community
There was a heated online debate about the advertising of a breast-sucking company that compared breastfeeding mothers to their headrests.
According to Elvie, he developed the “world’s first silent, portable breast suction device” and their product was advertised in an ironic advertisement citing music videos that showed how much freedom the device gives to mothers who are breastfeeding.
Four real mothers are dancing in a choir with a psalm, while in the background you can hear the lyrics that draw the following lines: "Yeah, I understand, I still don't have a ass" and "If it hadn't come up, it's not my tits, it's my breasts."
And the refrain says, "I pump, I pump, I pump, I pump, I pump, I pump, I blow, I'm gonna blow up the girls."
The company’s Facebook ad was quickly caught up in online debates.
The video reached 77,000 views, and hundreds of comments indicating mixed receptions were received. Many say that advertising makes fun of the dairy industry's "concerns."
“It is very unpleasant to advertise the product with cows.
Similarly, their bodies produce milk only if they give life to their offspring, but their calves are taken away from them within days,” recalls one commentator.
Elvie Breast Suction Discreetly Placed in a Breast Suction Holder (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Yes, it’s awful for mothers and calves as well.
But why don’t we use them to sell breast-suction to mothers who can keep their baby?”
Someone else added, “Completely insensitive ad.”
Others stood up to protect the advertisement, a woman admitted that she thought the video was “very funny.”
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I would have bought it if I still breastfeeded.
I felt like a cow too.
It's a stupid advertisement, so I'm not trying to see it anymore.
“The product is brilliant,” he wrote.
Another commenter said: “This is a funny ad in their workplace or in a toilet for mothers who are heading for milk who feel “smooth” because of it.
It is not the dairy beach that praises or condemns you.”
At the end of the video, the women showed that while dancing, there was a discreet breast suction device in their chest bra.
The campaign is based on the feeling that women who use breast-suction sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is quiet, does not use wires or pipes, can be discreetly placed in a breastfeeding bra, so women can move freely, hold their child in their hands, or even move out during breast suction.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and director of communications at Mother, said: “Elvie Pump was a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
In pointing out the parallel between the women who are heading and the headrests, we wanted to draw attention to the challenges that the use of suction cups presents, and to sense in a funny way how our suction cups provide a sense of freedom in relation to this.”
It's not the first time Elvie's breast suction got into the news.
In London Fashion Week, a two-year-old mother dressed as Marta Jakubowski walked out of the store while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of children in detention has reached a record high, while the number of monthly border crossings has not changed much, partly because of the Trump administration’s rough rhetoric and the measures it has taken so far.
Receptionists are typically illegal immigrants themselves, and they fear that it would ruin their chances of staying in the country if they applied for child reception.
This threat continued to grow in June, when it was announced that parents applying to be hosts and adults living with them in a household should be given a fingerprint, and this data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, head of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, admitted in a statement before Congress last week that dozens of people have been detained who have applied for entry without the escort.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the detainees were imprisoned.
“80% of the applicants and those living with them in a household are illegally residing in the country, and a significant proportion of them are convicted criminals.
Therefore, we continue to search for such individuals,” Albence said.
In order to accelerate the procedure for children, new rules have been introduced, according to which some of them must appear before the court within one month of their detention, rather than 60 days, the social workers say.
Many people apply to the court via videoconferencing instead of a personal appearance to apply for a residence permit via videoconferencing.
If the judge does not provide legal protection, the immigrant will be expelled quickly.
In recent months, social workers and system workers have reported that the longer the detention takes, the more nervous and depressed children will be, and the chances of violent outbreaks or assassination attempts are increased.
According to lawmakers, these risks are only increased by a larger facility like the towers, where the number of children makes it more difficult to filter out those who are required to take psychological care.
They added that if they do not provide enough time for the children to prepare or say goodbye to their friends before they are moved to such a facility, they will be even more traumatic.
Syria has called for immediate departure of US, French and Turkish "assaulting forces"
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland despite the eighth-year civil war in the country.
Mr Moualem, who also served as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces had illegally entered the territory of Syria by calling for the fight against terrorism and "will treat them in the same way."
“They have to leave immediately and unconditionally,” he told the General Assembly.
Moualem said the “war on terror” in Syria “will soon end,” where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions have been forced to leave their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus is “continuing its holy struggle to cleanse Syria’s entire territory” from terrorist groups and “illegal foreign presence.”
2,000 U.S. troops remain in Syria, most of them as trainers and advisers to Kurdish forces and Arab militias fighting against Bashar al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 troops to the war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem argued that the conditions were appropriate for their return, and that only "some Western countries" were "irrational fears" and that refugees would not be allowed to return home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help bring the population home,” he said.
“They made politics out of a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and his opposition about ending the war.
According to U.N. diplomats, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey that creates a conflict zone for the last major uprising of the insurgents, around Idlib, could help further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal has prevented Russian-backed Syrian government forces from launching a wide-ranging attack on the three million-populated province.
At the same time, Moualem stressed that the agreement sets “clear deadlines” and indicated his Abbey hopes that military actions were only jihadists, including against the al-Nusra Front, which is bound to “shoulder out.”
U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee of government and opposition delegates, which is responsible for preparing the post-war Syrian constitution and for preparing elections, can be convened soon.
Among the conditions of Moualem, the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, for example, is only acceptable to “revise some of the articles of the current constitution” and protects all external actors from interference in the process.
That's why Trump will be re-elected.
Following this logic, Trump will certainly be re-elected in 2020, unless the hopes of many liberal viewers come true, and he will not end his presidency before a withdrawal process or a scandal.
We can be sure that this would be “the most dramatic presidential finale of all time.”
For now, however, the audience enjoys the show.
Since 2014, CNN’s mainstream viewing has nearly doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled its viewing to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers during the main show, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is the most watched cable show with its audience of 3.5 million people.
“We’re attracted like fire, because something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the lead producer of ABC’s drama series “The Nominated Survivor.” In this series, a low-ranked cabinet minister sits in the chair of the president’s chair, in a chair in a chair, in a chair, in a chair.
Nell Scovell, a veteran wrestler, is the author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club".
Here’s a quote from a Boston taxi before the 2016 election:
The driver said he was voting for Trump.
“Why?” asked Scovell.
"Because he's laughing," the driver replied.
This is the fun power of chaos.
Of course, unlike television series, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases like the Roe vs. Wade precedent, whether immigrants’ families can rejoin and the stability of the world economy.
Only a very narrow layer can make it, so that you don't worry about these facts.
But it is no longer part of the responsible information, as we watch for the sixth hour a series of vitamins, in which it is about the authenticity of anonymous background conversations used in Bob Woodward’s book “Fear,” or Paul Manafort’s <0x24>15,000 pencil, or the <0x24>15,000 staple skin of his body, which he killed.
As far as I'm concerned, from now on, this will always come to mind about Super Mario.
“It feels a bit like watching a reality show where we get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, the creator of ‘Stars of the Storms’. The Trump show is a new one.
If you miss a single part, you'll miss it immediately.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a pleasant, 26-degree, sunny time in Kauain, but he still crawled in his house looking at MSNBC while filming the CNN show.
He couldn't break off the television as Brett Kavanaugh began hearing the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he was the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we made those crazy shows, many people said that this was the beginning of the end for Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought they were just joking, but it looks like they were right.”

Both parties cast money into the toughest competitions of the mid-term congressional election
No one is surprised that in Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency, both parties are spending innumerable money after two active delegates struggle for the same seat after relocating the congressional districts.
One of the competitors for the recently redesigned Pittsburgh suburb is Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a mandate in an interim election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently a member of Pennsylvania's former 12th constituency, which shows a significant overlap with the 17th constituency.
The map had to be redistributed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former county borders had been manipulated in favor of Republicans.
In the fight for District 17, the two parties' funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) nearly auctioned each other during the campaign.
Lamb's name came to be known in Pennsylvania after he won a tight race in the 18th congressional constituency in Pennsylvania, which was a major midterm election in March.
For more than a decade, Donald Trump won the county with a 20-point lead.
According to political experts, Democrats have a slightly better chance of winning.
U.S. sanctions against El Salvador for China's support and then quit the plan.
According to diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama were already on the side of Beijing, which Washington had barely reacted to.
Donald Trump negotiated with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in a good mood in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners narrowed the Trump Organization’s leadership team.
The U.S. Department of State has called back U.S. mission chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for their “recent decision not to support Taiwan,” said Heather Nauer, a spokeswoman for the ministry.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received approximately <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including in the fight against drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial subsidies and targeted visa restrictions, would have affected the Central American country, where unemployment and murder rates are also extremely high.
As the closed-loop meetings continued, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been the continuation of a similar meeting last year, and which was the primary objective of the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that I would like to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they do not want to punish El Salvador.
At the conference scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence also spoke, which, according to diplomats, is a clear indication of how important the administration is to the event.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue convictions and did not impose criminal sanctions.
White House spokesman John Bolton did not want to disclose details of the debate, which three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, reported anonymously.
Their accounts were also supported by external analysts close to the administration, who were also only willing to speak anonymously.
Historical Experiences
The next strike could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Trump has somehow obstructed the administration of justice...and many public facts point to this.
Mueller’s investigation is also alleged to cover whether Trump’s team has cooperated with Russia trying to influence the elections.
If Democrats get a majority in Congress, they’re probably trying to hold Trump accountable, who, after the voters, might have to face his fellow politicians’ judgment.
We can see that there are many uncertain questions, and the fall of Trump is far from inevitable... as well as his fellow Europeans.
Severe decisions must be made on both sides of the Atlantic – depending on how long the fight will last.
In 1938, a number of German officers were ready to overthrow Hitler, only waiting for the West to stand next to the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
The aid was lacking, so it was not possible to prevent the protection of the following years.
At such historic milestones, the inevitable development of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
In today’s America, we can identify several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump replaces Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Chief Justice of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein’s chair has been drinking since last year, when, as our newspaper reported, he suggested recording talks with the president, and called for Trump to be inappropriate to fill the office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times reported the events inaccurately.
“How will we respond if the F.B.I. investigation initiated against Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or incomplete, and is appointed a member of the Supreme Court despite a seemingly credible sexual harassment charge?
And the most important question is, are we voting in the midterm elections for a Congress that is ready to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail at these trials, democracy is looking forward to a long winter.
I trust that this will not be the case, mainly because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that was once housed in the building of the ambassador’s home.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and asked 60 years later to light candles on a table bearing the sign of the swastika at the time of the Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how can I be pessimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans at the Rangers is confident before the Rapid Wien match
Rangers will be hosting Rapid Wien on Thursday. A victory against the Austrians against the Spanish Villarreal can guarantee them their participation in the Europa League Group G following an unexpected decision.
The midfielder, Graham Dorrans, was unable to make a run for the 2-2 game against Villarreal this season, but he feels that, based on this result, the Rangers can also set more daring goals for themselves.
“There was a big point for a great team against Villarreal,” said the 31-year-old.
“We believed that we were able to get a point, and we got a point.
Maybe at the end we could've scored another goal, but we couldn't complain about the undecided.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
There will be another important European match on Thursday.
I hope we get the three points, but it won’t be easy because they were good enough in their previous match, but with our fans behind us, we will certainly have the strength to win.
Last year was pretty hard, I was hurt, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
Our team is good, the guys enjoy the game, the training goes well.
I hope that if we put everything in, we can leave the previous season behind and achieve good results."
Many women are worried about not saving enough for their age.
Participants in the survey had an accurate idea of what kind of elderly care they wanted, but only a small part of them talked about it with their family members.
According to a Nationalwide survey, only half of the respondents discussed with their spouse the expected costs of their elderly care.
Only 10% of respondents said they talked about it with their children.
“Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they’re not used to talking about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
The following is worth doing.
First, discuss the question with your spouse and children: Do not expect them to take proper care of you if you do not tell us in time what your needs are.
Together with the counselor and his family, they choose where and what kind of care they want; these decisions have a significant impact on the subsequent costs.
Hire a financial advisor: he can give you useful ideas on how to pay for the planned care.
Financing can be done with a traditional, old-fashioned insurance bond, or a combined life insurance with a hybrid savings insurance that can cover expenses, or use your own assets as a cover... if you have enough resources to add to it.
Prepare the legal documentation: This is how you can pre-cut off the possibility of later filing.
Entrust a representative, a trusted person who deals with health issues on your behalf, supervises medical care, and ensures that everything is done according to your expectations, even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone with your financial management as well.
This reliable person will make the necessary financial decisions and will take care of paying the bills when you are unable to do so.
Do not forget about the small details either: Let's say your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer any questions about your medications and allergies?
These data are recorded in writing to be made available at any time.
“It’s not just financial issues that need to be clarified, it doesn’t matter who your doctor is,” Martin added.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned in advance.”
Man shot several times with air bullets in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air bullet when he was heading home after his evening program.
The 40-year-old victim was attacked in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, with a shot on his chest, chest and arm.
The police described the shooting at around 2:30 a.m. local time as "accidental".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and rainfall in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake on Friday, followed by a flood in the Indonesian city of Palu, where the death toll could continue to rise.
The area's communications network was also damaged, so there was no news yet from the Dongala Governorate north of Palu, where it was the center of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people had to be evacuated.
Some important information about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, on the western coast of Celebes, built at the end of a narrow bay, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
It was the 40th anniversary of the city’s founding, when the earthquake and the waterfall struck it.
The Donggala Governorate is located more than 300 km long on the northwestern coast of the island of Celebes.
The population of the governorate – a smaller administrative region of the province – was approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Central Celebes is characterized primarily by fisheries and agriculture, especially in the coastal areas of Dongala.
Nickel mining is one of the important sectors of the economy, but mainly concentrates in Morowali, on the outskirts of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, floods have hit Palut and Donggala several times in the last 100 years.
A fountain in 1938 killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggal.
In 1996, a waterfall struck the West Dongal, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the area of the terrestrially active Pacific Fire Ring, which is why earthquakes are common.
Just a few of the biggest earthquakes and floods of recent years:
On December 26, 2004, a massive naval crash on the western coast of North Sumatra, Aceh Province, triggered a 14-country watershed that claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coastline, killing more than half of the victims in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the southernmost part of the island of Jáva, Indonesia, and the aftermath of a flood killed nearly 700 people on the southern coast.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake destroyed Padang, near the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude quake shook one of the islands of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, sparking a 10-metre fountain that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A near-surface crash hit the governorate of Aceh Pidie Jaya. Panic and devastation in her tracks have often evoked the memories of the terrible 2004 flood.
This time there was no waterfall, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombok is a popular Indonesian island among tourists; a high-powered rise here claimed 500 lives, mainly in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings have become equal to the land, and thousands of tourists on the island have been trapped for a while.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, Sarah Palin's son, former Alaskan governor and vice president, was arrested on charges of bodily abuse.
The 29-year-old Palin lives in Wasila, Alaska, and is suspected of committing domestic violence, preventing domestic violence from being reported, and resisting arrest, Alaskan State Police said.
According to the police report, when a female detective tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she took the woman's phone.
Palin is being detained in the Mat-Su dental ward, with a <0x24>500 bail, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday and answered the question about his guilt that he was "not guilty at all."
Palin is charged with class A infringement, which means he can be sentenced to up to four years in prison and a fine of <0x24>250,000.
In addition, they are also charged with a Class B infringement, which may result in one-day detention and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin is in conflict with the law.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged attack to the police.
The case is currently being discussed by the Alaska Veteran Law Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and with obstruction to the reporting of the crime, as well as in connection with possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol.
His girlfriend at the time claimed that the man had hit him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans for attributed her son's behavior to post-traumatic stress from the Iraqi service.
Earthquake and rainfall in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384 people were killed in a Friday earthquake on the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake erupted a fountain that destroyed thousands of homes.
The systems responsible for power supply and telecommunications have become inoperable, and the number of deaths is likely to increase in the coming days.
The center of the earthquake was near Central Celebesz, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
A number of videos have been posted on social media about the arrival of the spring.
Hundreds of people gathered on the coast of Palu at a celebration, when the fountain price reached the shore.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Death Penalty for Suspect of New York Terrorist Attack
New York's federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York City that claimed eight lives, and have not been executed in the state since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old man, was charged in October with a lorry rented from Home Depot on a bicycle route called Lower Manhattan West Side Highway, gassing many pedestrians and bicycles.
To prove the legality of the death penalty, prosecutors need to prove that Saipov has “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intended” to cause injuries, according to a statement from the New York District Attorney’s Office.
According to the document submitted, the evidence of any of the two charges could justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipovo was charged with 22 crimes, including eight-course piracy murder, which has so far been used almost exclusively against organised crime, as well as the destruction and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack “required significant planning and premeditated intent,” the prosecutors said, and Saipov said it carried out in a “personal, cruel, inhuman” way.
Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused pain and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’s families.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's southern district last year demanded the death penalty for a prosecution.
Khalid Barnest was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he was sentenced to life in prison.
In a New York federal case, in 1953, they were finally sentenced to death, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the couple were sentenced two years earlier for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 in the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, said the court documents showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
During the interviews, he said that he was happy to do it.
Saipov said that ISIS videos viewed on his phone gave him the idea of the attack, he said.
Police say he asked to put an ISIS flag in his hospital room.
In all 22 counts, he pleaded innocent.
David Patton, one of Saipovo’s state attorneys, said they were “very disappointed” with the prosecutors’ decision.
“In our opinion, the actual loss of life imprisonment for the confessor’s confession would have been more favourable, the death penalty only extends the suffering of all those involved in the case,” Patton said.
Saipov’s lawyers had earlier urged prosecutors not to demand the death penalty for defenders.
Tory MP Says NIGEL FARAGE Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
In a demonstration at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage said he was "inviting the people's army to fight".
Ukip’s former leader said politicians should feel the pressure of Eurosceptics after a party partner, Theresa May, called for Farage to be entrusted with negotiations with the EU.
Non-official conservative Peter Bone told attendees of the Birmingham summit that the UK would have “already left” if Farage were the Brexit minister.
It is well-characterized by the pressure within the Mayre-intensive party that the left-wing Toryk spoke in another anti-Brexit protest in the city.
May is endeavouring to implement the Chequers plan, which calls for a permanent settlement between Brexit and the remaining parties, as well as the EU.
In spite of the negative reactions, his allies say he is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels so that Eurosceptics and the Labour Party can only choose between their package or “complete chaos”.
Bone at Leave Means Leave in Solihull (“Leaving Means Leave Means Leave”) said in a demonstration that the “Chequers Alcohol” should be deducted.
He suggested that Farage should be elevated to the House of Lords and that the negotiations with Brussels should be entrusted to him.
“If he had led the negotiations, we would have left,” he said.
A spokesman for Wellingborough added: “You stand by Brexit, but you have to pay off with the Chequers.”
Criticizing the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be slaves of others.
We want to bring in the laws of our own country.”
Bone rejected the assumption that since the 2016 vote, he has changed the public mood: “There is no realistic basis for the British people to have changed their opinion and want to stay.”
Andrea Jenkyns, the representative of the Brexit Tory party, also attended the meeting, and told reporters: “All I ask is: Prime Minister, listen to the people’s speech.
The Chequers treaty rejects public opinion, the opposition will not vote, party membership is unpopular, and especially among activists who work on the ground and have helped us get to the government.
Forget the Chequers and listen to us."
He added: “Only the Prime Minister can hold his seat, who keeps his word.”
Farage said at the meeting that politicians should “feel the pressure” to not dare to tell the results of the 2016 referendum.
“The confidence between us, the people and our politicians, is now a bet,” he said.
“They want to sell Brexit, and today we’ve come together to beat them, not let them do it.”
He said: “I would like our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, to feel the pressure.
“We are calling on the people’s army to fight for victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we make the United Kingdom an independent, independent, proud country again.”
Meanwhile, the remaining parties resigned in Birmingham and held a two-hour meeting in the city center.
Some activists have raised the banner of the “Toryk against Brexit” movement this weekend.
Workers' Party Lord Adonis has been deployed in the Conservatives' application of the party due to security errors that occurred at the opening of the conference.
“These people have said that they have their IT background to a Canada-plus-plus agreement, to cross borders without restrictions, and to a free trade agreement with Ireland without borders,” he added.
- They're just talking about it.
There is simply no good Brexit," he said.
Warren is “probably thinking” about starting the presidency.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she would consider going for the presidency.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke on Saturday about his future at a West Massachusetts population forum.
Donald Trump’s regular judge Warren is set to run for re-election in November against the state’s Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It’s been a long time since there have been speculations that he might be the one to replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was a meeting with voters at the 36th Population Forum since Trump stepped into office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for the presidential election.
In response, Warren said it was time for “women to take part in Washington’s restoration of the semi-recycled government, including the occupying of the highest position.”
Arrested Person Suspected of Shooting Sims Playing in LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Friday they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of a basketball player in the LSU, Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Office announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. east coast time.
Earlier, a video of Friday's shooting was released, and they were asked for help identifying the man on footage.
The 20-year-old Simst was shot near the University of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury from the shooting, which turned out to be deadly," police captain Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wayde's friend intervened to protect him, then shot Simpson.
Simpson admitted in the interrogation that he was on the spot, had a gun, and he shot Wayde Sims.
The arrest of Simpson took place without incident, the man was arrested at the East Baton Rouge District Police Office.
In Baton Rouge, an adult, the Sims played 32 matches last season, 10 as a starter, played an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 points per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets closer to the World Championship title after winning in front of Sebastian Vettel thanks to the team's instructions
After Valtteri Bottas qualified for a better place than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became immediately clear that the instructions from the Mercedes team will play a major role in the race.
Bottas from the pole position started well and almost put Hamilton in trouble as he defended his position in the first two rounds, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first stood out in the boxing yard and let Hamilton get stuck in the middle-field traffic, which should have proved to be a decisive one.
Mercedes stood out a lap later, and Vettel came out behind, but Hamilton went ahead after a close action, during which the Ferrari pilot left the inner arch loosely after moving twice as a defense in the third lap.
Max Verstappen, who is celebrating his 21st birthday, started in the back row of the bats, and was seventh at the end of the first round.
He then drove for much of the race because he didn’t exchange tires to quickly reach his goal and beat Kimi Räikkönen in the hopes of fourth place.
Finally, he stood out in the 44th round of boxing, but in the remaining eight rounds he was unable to increase his pace, so Räikkönen became fourth.
“It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman when he was asked to let me go.
With exceptional work, the team has achieved the first two places," Hamilton said in a statement.
His body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump bullied Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday as the senator insisted that she did not sneak out Christine Blasey Ford’s letter, which accuses sexual harassment of new member of the Supreme Court Kaughvana.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony, which he made before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but only noted that what happens in the Senate proves that people are "hateful, hateful and false."
“What can happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days, when they see anger, when they see people being angry, ugly, hateful, and lying,” he said.
“If we look at the statements and the evictions, they say, ‘Well, well, that wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you running away?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document? – “oh, oh, what is it?
Oh, no.
I didn't run away."
Well, let's stop for a moment.
“No, we didn’t, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July to Feinstein, and the letter leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the source of the leak was his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to treat him confidentially, and I treated him confidentially according to his request.”
However, it seems that the president did not accept his refusal, who commented at the meeting on Saturday night: “I’ll tell you what the situation is: your body speech was very bad.
Maybe he didn't run out, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president further defended the candidate of the supreme court for sexual harassment by the three women, claiming that Democrats are using the alleged allegations for their own purposes.
“They’ve tried to do it by any means, but they’re going to get back power.
They can see the hypocrisy, the hatred, they don’t care who they’re hurt, they have to gas out to gain power and control,” the president said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars–Belfast Giants 5:3
The Giants, Patrick Dwyer, scored two goals against Dundee
With a 5:3 win on Saturday in Dundee, the Dundee Stars lost to the Belfast Giants in Friday's Elite League.
Through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier, the Giants have already gained dual leadership early.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equated their homelands, after which Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard equalized Dundee's downside, and Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their win with two goals.
Adam Keefe's players were the third Elite League defeat of the season, who defeated Dundee 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast.
The two halfs met for the fourth time in the season, and the Giants won in the previous three games.
Dwyer opened in the fourth minute, at 3:35 p.m., from Kendall McFaull's goal pass, and four minutes later, with the help of David Rutherford, Beauvillier doubled their advantage.
In the spinning opening third, Sullivan brought his home page back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt's pass was equalized by Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants could take a break when he hit his second goal the night at the end of the first third.
The home team reorganized a series, and Bouchard scored again with a man-favoured goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran's overall game helped Nielsen gain lead to Dundee's second third in the game for the first time, and then secured the win with the team's fifth goal in the last half.
The Giants, who lost four of their last five matches, went home to Milton Keynes for the next game on Friday.
Aviation Controller Killed Hundreds on Airplane to Survive Earthquake
As a hero, they celebrate an air traffic controller in Indonesia who lost his life while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than eight hundred people were killed and many disappeared after a major earthquake on the island of Celebes on Friday caused a flooding.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many people have been forced into the rubble in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the wildly outgoing control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in the city.
It remained there to ensure that Batik Air’s flight 6321, which was already in operation, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later lost his life in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirai, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter had arrived in Palu.
“Our heart was broken when we heard the news,” he added.
The authorities are concerned that the death toll could be thousands, according to the country’s Disaster Response Organisation, the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are difficult to reach.
“The number of casualties is likely to continue to increase as many are trapped under the wreckage and many have not been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization.
The six-metre-high waves destroyed Palut, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aviation vehicles provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “The ambulances bring new bodies every minute.
There is little clean water.
The small shops have been dumped everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, Indonesia’s leader of the International Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors in the race with time, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is a real tragedy, but it can be even worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the country’s troops: “I ask all of you to work day and night on the tasks related to evacuation!
Are you ready?", reported CNN.
Indonesia has been hit by earthquakes on the island of Lombok this year, in which more than fifty-five people have died.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says a person has disappeared in a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline in Micronesia, a Pacific lagoon crashed, said a man had disappeared, although it was previously claimed that both the 47 passengers and crew evacuated successfully from the plane.
According to the Air Niugini press release, according to the Sunday afternoon situation, a man cannot give a number of passengers.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to additional information about the passenger, such as questions of age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while landing at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people were being transported to the hospital.
According to the airline, six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events have not yet been clarified.
According to the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the landing track.
According to witnesses, the plane took off the landing track.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane landed very low.
“That’s definitely a good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes told me that he was able to gasoline in water with others until the emergency exits of the submerged airplane.
According to him, the air escorts panicked and shouted, and he suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, a ship repairing a coastline nearby was also assisted in the rescue, and people were transported to the shore with an inflatable boat before the plane sank 30 meters under the water.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have been killed in accidents involving airlines with PNG registration over the past two decades, but none have affected Air Niugin.
Analyst compiled the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor presented the man to the accused in the retrial of the man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an information analysis expert.
He told the jury how he compiled the cell phone records of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of the woman's death.
According to Rowlett, he received location data from several phones, according to which he was with Tellis Chambers on the night of the woman's death, which contradicted the man's earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data revealed that his phone was near Chambers when the man said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he said he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another controversy was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when the woman died.
According to mobile phone data, they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted the woman's text messages, calls, and contact details from her phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing speech on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be brought to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio called for a negative outlook on the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
According to The High Breed in Bristol, hip hop was removed from its roots in political messages and social problems.
They would like to go back to these roots and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Actors like The Fugees and Common are again popular in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Is it a black one again?
New York high school lady indicted for firing a party after a “racist” message
A New York midwife filed a lawsuit against a couple for their miscarriage of discrimination after her mother complained in a message wrongly sent to her that they had been able to apply a "black" midwife again.
The couple denies that they are racist, and they are likened to “scamming.”
The two-child mother, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her disappointment when in 2016, on her first day at work, the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, saw that the woman was black.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEM, I’m scared of it!” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after waking up to her shot, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "unpleasant" herself, fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that the leaving lady, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino woman.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home with an Uber.
Maurice now seeks compensation for the dismissal and demands compensation of <0x24>350 a day for the six-month-old job he was originally hired for, albeit without a contract.
“While I want to show them how to stop the race, that cannot be done,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple reacted to the allegations that they were accused of racism that the termination of Maurice’s application was reasonable because they feared they could not trust him after he was offended.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t mean.
Not racist.
We're not racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you trust your children to someone who, even by chance, was rude?
Your newborn?
Come on!"
Plasco said his wife gave birth to the baby just two months ago and was “in a very difficult situation.”
“Will anyone attack such a thing?
It’s not really nice to do that,” the investment banker added.
While legal proceedings are taking place, the court of public opinion has already quickly condemned the party in the social media, damaging their behavior and logic.
According to a recently found letter, Paddington’s publisher was afraid that readers would not be able to bind to a speaking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s adoption, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine someone reading for the first time before it was published.
This information is quite entertaining now that we already know what a huge success Paddington is."
His father, who worked as a BBC operator before he was inspired to write a children’s book about a little toy, said he wouldn’t have bothered if his work had been rejected, and then added that he was celebrating the 60th anniversary of the book’s release.
He called Paddington “a very important member of our family,” adding that his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a very quiet man, he was not at all imagined,” he said.
“But since Paddington was almost real to him, it was like a child who takes us to something: we’re proud of it even if it’s not really what we deserve.
I think he could see Paddington's success in some way.
Although he created it and patented it out of his imagination, he has always attributed success to Paddington’s merit.”
My daughter is dead, and I had to say goodbye by phone
When she and her daughter landed, they were rushed to Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nizza, where the doctors fought for their lives in vain.
“Nad called regularly to tell me she was in very poor condition and that she wasn’t expecting her to survive,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad telling her that my daughter is going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
Good-bye.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave him to keep his heart beating, he slowly lost weight and then left his body.
He died before, and then it all stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to end.
I couldn’t cry or cry, because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, already saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the others who did not care about the trial she had just undergone.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
“I shook my head and all the time I was crying.
It's hard to explain, but there on the plane I felt this overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That she needs my love and understanding.
I knew she loved my daughter very much.”
Card for Prevention of Suicides on the Bridge with Crying Women
Two women, who have lost their loved ones because of suicide, work to prevent others from throwing their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys uploaded card cards full of inspiring messages and ambulance numbers on a Welsh bridge.
Ms Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the same way I feel every day,” he said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook, and that he caught everyone.
“Everyone knew about his smile.
“They always said that your smile would leave any place.”
However, before his death, he gave up his work because he was “very ill.”
Tyler, who ended his life by himself, was found by his then 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said, "I was constantly worried that this would cause some domino effect."
Ms. David made the cardboards with the goal of "that people know there are people who can be searched for and talked to, even if it's just a friend.
“Don’t sit still, you need to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has lost Ms. Davies' girlfriend for years, Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, not long after the man's mother died.
“He didn’t say he was depressed, depressed, or anything,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
It was completely under you on Christmas Day: when the children opened their gifts, they didn't look into their eyes and so on."
He said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to deal with it: “He left a huge space in the family.
He broke our heart into small pieces.
But we have to keep fighting."

The Future of Brett Kavanaugh as the FBI Starts Investigation
“I thought if we were able to achieve what he was asking for — a limited time, limited-size investigation — maybe we could reach agreement,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that the committee was holding back because of the party’s failure to “fall into pieces.”
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and Republican supporters object to the FBI investigation?
Their resistance can only be attributed to timing.
The interim election is only five weeks, on November 6th, and if Republicans are expected to fail well, it will be much harder for them to bring their men to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby with them for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and through it he also identified his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases the report?
In the Senate, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get a minimum of 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to take Mr. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of dissidents 'reduced' under Kim's control
The number of North Korean dissidents in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Bjengszok quoted data from the Southern Unification Ministry as saying that there were 1127 dissidents in the last year compared to 2011, when this number was 2706.
Park said that the tighter border guards between North Korea and China, as well as higher penalties for human smuggling, were the main reasons.
Phenjan has not commented on this information publicly.
The majority of North Korean dissidents eventually get South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee to China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
Dissidents are accepted by China as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and are often sent back by force.
Relations between North and South, which are still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and were at the center of the talks on the ongoing nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This June historic meeting came between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on a major deal on further cooperation on the nuclear-weapon-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Jongho, blamed the U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of trust in the American people, our national security is not compromised, and in such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally dismantle our weapons,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi named Brett Kavanaugh as “hysterical” because she thought she was inappropriate for the Supreme Court
The House's minority president, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claimed that his behavior was not in line with the work of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I thought, unintentionally, that if a woman were to behave like this at any time, I would call it ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi’s reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony was made before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh warmly protested the rumors that she had sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford in her teenage years.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and his voice slipped when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also specifically condemned the committee's Democrats, calling the allegations against him a "gross and coordinated character murder" because of Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election, organized by angry liberals.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh's behavior proved to be unsuitable for his work in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was deceiving the Democrats.
“I think he’s excluded himself with his statements and the behavior he’s witnessed against the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if he would try to hold Kavanaugh accountable in the event that he fills the post and the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m saying that if you don’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it’s not just the Supreme Court, but the court where it is right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge in the capital’s Appeals Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions regarding the Affordable Services Act or the Roe vs. Wade case, as Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh's hearings, he outlined questions about whether he would copy the Supreme Court's decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, deceased person to be among the members of the court, and he expects us to be repelled from the joy,” Pelosi said.
And women need to hold hands.
It’s a legitimate outburst of anger that has been accumulated for months and years, and you can’t leave without crying.
“We cry when we’re poisoned,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s so rare, do I?”
“A woman who worked in a leadership position somewhere was very helpful to me,” she continued. “She told me that she was crying in anger too, but she developed a technique that, when she started crying in anger, she said to her interlocutor, “Maybe you think I’m sad, I’m crying.
But I'm angry."
And then he just went on.
And I thought it was a great idea.”
In part, they see tears as a sign of anger because they were fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is from an early job, from a men’s-run office, where I once began to cry in an angry impotence when an older woman — a cool manager I was always afraid of — caught up in my neck and took me to the staircase.
“Never let them see me cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad, and they’ll be happy because they’ve managed to upset you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair called Monkey Business, and she fell out of the competition, Ms. Schroeder found in her deep frustration that there was no reason why she could not begin the presidency herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the competition, and another candidate was expected to be in the middle of their backs.
Somebody called it "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since she had been campaigning for a long time, Ms. Schroeder missed the fundraising, so she accepted that she would not enter the competition unless she collected the <0x24>2 million.
It was a battle to lose.
He found that some of his supporters gave <0x24>1,000 to the men, but he only received <0x24>250.
“They thought I was getting a discount?” he thought.
When she held a press conference that she did not launch an official campaign, she was so moved by feelings of gratitude for the people who supported her, as well as the accumulation of money and the system that directly made it difficult for the voters to get there.
“They might have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder told reporters.
“They might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they're going to write on my gravestone?
“Spirit?”
How can the U.S.-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening of the trade war between the United States and China was almost a deadlock, and while the battle is not yet over, the break between the countries could be a long-term benefit to Beijing, experts say.
Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump issued the first warnings by levying taxes on major Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week, as the new tariffs are already affecting a product worth <0x24>200 billion, virtually taxing half of the goods from China to the US.
In all cases, Beijing has cut tariffs of the last five to ten percent on <0x24>60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has admitted that it is going back every time, and the world’s second-largest economy is certainly not going to retreat in the near future.
If you want to get Washington to back down, it would mean you have to give up on the demands, but a public referral to the US would be too embarrassing for Hsi Chin-ping, the president of China.
However, experts say if Beijing is tacticing well, the US trade war could benefit China in the long run as it reduces the dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision in both Washington and Beijing can create conditions that push any of the economies of the two countries into economic law is much more serious than it was previously recognized by observers,” said Abigail Grace, an American investigator at the New York Times.
Syria is “ready” for return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed in the war for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Moallem said that the state of the country is improving.
“The current situation is more stable and safer, thanks to the results achieved in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, who had to escape between terrorism and self-imposed economic measures, which affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Moallem said the Syrian state would welcome any help to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team at the 16.5:10.5 Le Gold National outside of Paris.
The U.S. has now fallen to the European stage for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended its championship title as the team of Danish team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star who fought all over the tournament, knocked him in the water at the 16th hole of Par-3, giving the win to Francesco Molinar.
The Italian golfer Molinari has become one of the four players who have ever scored 5-0-0 since starting the tournament in its current form in 1979.
With Jordan Spieth 5&4, he was awarded to the European team’s lowest-ranking player, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to Ian Poulter, who may have participated in his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the best European winner of the tournament of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I couldn’t stop today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for his choice and belief in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy I got the cup back.
It’s all about the team and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia, who struggles with emotions, said after the European victory.
The team will be handed over to Jon Rahm, who individually defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this man,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 main titles and who only Jack Nicklaus precedes.
The U.S. team fought all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who played great golf throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing result, US team captain Jim Furyk said, “I’m proud of these guys because they fought.
There was a time this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Put the hat down in front of Thomas.
Great captain. Great captain.
All the 12 players played very well.
We will regroup our team, we will work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You guys need to lift your hats, too.
The opponent was better than us.”
