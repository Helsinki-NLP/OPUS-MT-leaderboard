It's still being produced today, but most importantly, the growth of the photographs in which it was copied as a way to capture images on digital cameras.
It is confusing that the so-called format is 35mm actually with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
Aspect ratio of this format (we give it ten times a history to get a simple full number) so it's called three:two.
Many common formats (APS family of APS formats, for example) are equal to or very close to the reality of this level of sharing.

Only older children can be discouraged or discouraged before they are heard or known.
