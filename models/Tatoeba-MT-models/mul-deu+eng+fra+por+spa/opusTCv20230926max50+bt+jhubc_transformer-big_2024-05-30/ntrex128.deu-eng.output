Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
For some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) causes shock.
There are plans to change the name of the National Assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
Members of the National Assembly of all political directions are afraid to become the target of the spot.
A member of the National Assembly of the Labour Party said his group was concerned that the name “twp” and “pwp” were worn.
For non-Walesian readers: in Welsh, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" stands for "Aa".
A member of the National Assembly of the Plaid Cymru Party stated that the whole group was “unhappy” and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law to change names, said: “The final decision on designations for the members of the National Assembly is, of course, the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public hearing on the proposals, which resulted in broad support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly.
With regard to the titles of the Members of the National Assembly, the Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs preferred, while at a public hearing the MWP option was the most supported.
Members of the National Assembly seemingly propose alternative options, however, ringing a consensus for President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a bill within weeks, could pose a problem.
The Reforms Act will include further amendments to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on disqualification of members of the National Assembly and on the design of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly may, in their debate on the law, vote permanently on their names.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was set up to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim rises to Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed its inclusion in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name of the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I talked to said in the past that there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
“There are no more of them today.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“The social life of the people today looks different,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly meet.”
With the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough for as long as the church leaders assume, and that they will “be at the beginning sooner or later.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with condominiums in which people live who do not support the remaining places of refuge.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy properties in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and thus accelerate the complete closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most of the people who buy properties in these buildings will be members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black community that abhorred their worship in the vicinity became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Johnson's father planned the reconstruction, they commissioned the bell torch.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the bell tower as "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who sounded the bell ringing in July, used other words: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first bell tower played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who turned to the largest bell tower at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has happened in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors who were partly attracted by the church's lay leaders and partly by the diocese.
In July, the municipal board – the governing body consisting of lay leaders of the municipality – expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the municipal board, although this did not pray to the commission of the diocese’s ministers and succeeded.
Some members of the community complained about the lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Shark wounded in California 13-year-old while scuba diving after lobster
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while scuba diving.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s cry for help and padded with several others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought that the boy was happy to have caught a cheerleader, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, “I’ve been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that his entire key leg had been broken.
“I yelled that everyone should come out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was taken to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical condition.
The type of hais responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
For investigations and security reasons, officials stopped the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to advance the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is attacking boots, superdrugs and Debenhams with cosmetics departments in stores.
As part of a major push towards the UK cosmetic market of 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow, while fashion and household goods revenues decline, the larger cosmetic departments in eleven branches nationwide will be tested. If they continue to grow, they will be tested at the highest level in the year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for opportunities to use stores previously used for televisions, microwave appliances and household goods.
According to Sainsbury’s, the scope of its cosmetics range doubles for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also gain more space and brand areas similar to those in stores such as boats.
In addition, the supermarket is launching a relaunch of its makeup series “Boutique”, so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, fragrance shop will test at two Sainsbury’s stores. The first store was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second will be opened later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, retail outlets will increasingly look like shops as the supermarket chain with more services and non-food items tries to fight the discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has established hundreds of Argos stores and a number of Habitat stores since its purchase of the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, increasing food sales and profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s, but ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from the drug dealer's branches in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281-store pharmacy store to Celesio, the owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan in addition to an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our range of brands is tailored to all needs. Due to its attractive surroundings and convenient locations, we are now an attractive destination for shopping for cosmetics, questioning the previous type of shopping."
Peter Jones 'whispers' after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
"Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones is "wrong" after TV host Holly Willoughby retreated from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand True.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The 37-year-old “This Morning” moderator announced her retirement on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered "Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on their own new connection contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been “wrong” when the “Golden Girl” of television at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, because of their new businesses – worth up to 1.5 million British pounds – can no longer access to the common Maro-time homewear.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and would likely have doubled Willoughby’s estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her retirement from Truely on Instagram, Jones left the UK on his way to one of his vacation destinations.
A source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly from a distance.
It should ensure for them their future over the next decades in the long run.
His decision to withdraw was completely surprising to all the participants.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so soon before the market launch.
In central Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of “This Morning” moderator, one of the UK’s most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and potential further delays in market launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truely in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the moderator of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity" broadcast.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We are not commenting on his business affairs.”
Hard words “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he had received from the media for a comment that some would consider “non-presidential” and expected for such positive statements about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said imitating the voice of a news moderator:
“I didn’t give up.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting as Trump praised the first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearisation negotiations have come to an end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the top North Korean diplomat, said on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that the North does not have a “corresponding response” from the United States to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. was upholding sanctions that should maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim showed positive results: the end of the missile tests, support for the release of hostages, and the return of the deadly remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastated an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok were displaced, no national emergency has been declared a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not require international support, so that’s something difficult,” he said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the Disaster Protection Authority, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu on whether international agencies could participate in the relief measures.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still unfortunately poorly prepared for natural forces.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not a daily sight on other coastal strips.
Despite a warning, apparently missing tsunami warning syrene in Palu has probably contributed to the deaths.
Travelling between Indonesia’s many islands is a challenge in the optimal case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure at the core of his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of Joko, who is about to run for re-election next year, suffers from funding deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure from ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia, and members of the Muslim majority practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes and apartments when gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with macaques, arrows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores deep matches against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool at London's Stamford Bridge Stadium on Saturday with an 89-minute draw ahead of a Premier League loss to Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at his team's 0–1 draw in about 27 metres from Chelsea.
He targeted the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the rear post.
The shot sank high above the prison room and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I just tried to get myself into this position and get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always playing as much forward as possible, so I just tried to make as much time as possible for me,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn’t think too much about it and just accepted the shot.”
Chelsea led the Belgian star Eden Hazard to the semi-finals with 1-0 after a 25-minute draw.
The Blues stürmer gave a pass with his heel back to Mateo, then turned around near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a quick double pass in the midfield.
He then fired a good pass, so Hazard got into the prison.
Hazard left the defenders behind and ended up with a left shot at Liverpool’s Alisson Becker in the back of the net.
Liverpool will play in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples.
Chelsea will face UEFA Europa League Videoton on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Disaster Protection Authority said on Sunday.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the wreckage of buildings that had been triggered by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday, which had triggered waves up to six meters high, authorities spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was flooded with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed
After finding a woman's body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was launched.
The 44-year-old was found wounded at 7:55 p.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are urging residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in an early stage, but I ask anyone who has stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I ask all people, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with a dashcam, to contact us. They may have information that is of the utmost importance for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman arrived at the scene to find out where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and the police said they are about to inform the next relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was trying to get into his apartment, but was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to re-enter the building.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the event.
She repeats, “That’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the lockdown and another vehicle in front of the lockdown.
Within the blockade were several police officers who monitored the block.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call number 101 or contact Crimetoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and refer to Minutes entry 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell Statue in front of Parliament becomes the latest monument to the dispute over rewriting history
Their banning would be poetic justice for its Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Cricks' proposal as "torture" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s stand-up was the target.
The imagery tower in the English Civil Wars was neither organized nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of the prevailing 19th century opinion and part of the history writing of a figure that many still believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, more than anyone who defends Parliament against pressure from the outside, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully valid representation is the subject of continued history debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents a side of this gap.
His performances as a Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and reminding them."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed in a market in southwestern China by a pig.
The man, to whom only the surname "Yuan" was named, was found dead with a broken-down artery flowing blood near a pig shop in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject pork vaccines in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He was reportedly traveling with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door was open to a neighboring pig shop.
He said a large male pig with blood was found in the stall.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilo-heavy pig had killed the farmers.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and stained,” the cousin, to whom the surname was named “Wu”, was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been detained to prevent attacks on other people while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death, according to reports.
Although it is rare for pigs to attack humans, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 290 kilograms squeezed a Welsh farmer between him and a tractor until the farmer’s wife was able to infect the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs were not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a “propeller.”
“They’re just played.
They like to whistle and are very curious, ... they are not about to hurt anyone.
You just have to treat them with the right degree of respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening on the way over the colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring rainfall triggering flooding in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5:00 East Coast time, Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, which corresponds to a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a troop is starting to form across the Pacific, moving east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is transported north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will be triggering up to 25 centimeters of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, tropical humidity will generate heavy rainfall in the southwest due to interactions with the approaching trough.
Locally, from 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall can cause dangerous flooding, sludge in the water, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity occasionally results in precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in much of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of rain are expected.
Due to the dispersion of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Given the tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised not to walk into the desert.
Heavy rains can cause the canyons to burst into streams, and storms bring local winds as well as wind that brings dust.
The nearby slope brings locally strong rainfall in parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible to have a total amount of precipitation of more than one centimeter, which can lead in a small amount to water-driven sludge and to smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
The first isolated tropical rainstorms reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday, heavy rains spread into the Four-Corners region and stop on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
Over the next few days, the ongoing summer heat is trying to evolve and expand again.
For much of the central and eastern U.S., a warm beginning in October with widespread temperatures of 27<0xC2><0xB0>C is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast suggests a high likelihood of over-average temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million spectators have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million spectators on six television networks on Thursday saw the captivating statements of the nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
On Friday, television broadcasters suspended their regular program due to a last-minute turnover: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party, bullied her, and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million spectators reported by Nielsen have seen the audience.
The company determined the average spectator numbers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that had broadcast the hearing, the figures were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring spectator numbers in offices.
To put this in the right perspective: This corresponds to about the number of spectators at a play-off football game or at the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion-driven moderators strongly support Kavanaugh’s nomination, recorded the highest numbers of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers per day.
ABC came second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained strong after the hearing.
Flake was the main character in the drama of Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by CNN and CBS cameras as protesters tricked him loudly on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood for a minute with a low look while being shot. The scene was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
“They have power, while so many women are powerless,” said one woman.
Flake said his office had published a statement and supplemented it before the elevator concluded that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks broadcast live hours later, when the Justice Committee should vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination to vote in the Senate as a whole.
However, Flake said he would do this only on the condition that the FBI, as the Democratic minority demands, will investigate the charges against the candidate next week.
Flake is partly convinced by interviews with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has sparked an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Sunday Times accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union, to use Britain’s future for political purposes and to undermine the nation’s interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet for the Conservative Party party in Birmingham.
In an interview with her on the newspaper's title page, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson sharpened his attack on her so-called "Chequers Plan" for Brexit by proposing to de-escalate tariffs between Britain and the EU.
Deadly shootings on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shootings on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained by Baton Rouge police for murder.
According to police, the Sims lost their glasses during the battle, and the Sims lost their glasses.
According to CBS partner station WAFB, police secured the glasses at the scene and said Simpson’s DNA was found on the glasses.
After an interview with Simpson, the police reported that he had fired the deadly shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the deposit has been set at <0x24>350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Federal Police's Criminal Engineering Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional executive for “their care and their pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for LSU basketball.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply shocked" and "shocked" about Wayde's death.
“You’re always afraid of something like that,” Wade said.
Volcano sweeps ashes on Mexico City.
Ash ejected from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after increased activity in the crater and 183 gas and ash eruptions were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of riots and shakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected increased activity in the volcano 72 kilometres southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano known as “Don Goyo” has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between the pro-independence police and the pro-independence demonstrators, and thousands took part in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, who were detained by the readiness police, threw them off with eggs and also slipped paint powder, creating dark dust clouds in the streets usually populated with tourists.
In the course of the day, there were also handcuffs with the police who used their punches to curb the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups scanned “No Forgetting, No Forgiveness”, while confronting Unionists who shouted “Long Live Spain”.
According to the local press, 14 people were treated because of minor injuries suffered during the protests.
One year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid saw as illegal but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had voted overwhelmingly for independence, although voter turnout was low, as the opposition majority boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent voting in violent clashes before the elections.
Pro-independence groups had camped outdoors overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said he saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence, not with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents cry for joy because they could choose, but now we hang on,” he said.
Despite an important, albeit scarce, victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan Pro-Independence parties had difficulty maintaining the momentum. Many of their best-known leaders are either in exile or in detention depending on their own forced expulsion and where they were detained.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been stifled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in detention since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for next year’s European Parliament election.
“As a candidate for the European elections, the best way to announce the deterioration of democratic values and the repression by the Spanish government is,” he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested After House Was Cracked by Car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry was repeatedly hit by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballyngard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves were damaged.
In addition, he may have been shot at the car with an armpit.
Menga means 1-0 win over Rangers for Livingston
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
The ascent of Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to be decisive for Gary Holt's team to match Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premier League this season with no outstretched win and face the Hearts on Sunday, which are eight points behind.
Previously, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston can meanwhile increase his division victory series to six games, which means that Chief Coach Holt has not yet recorded a defeat since his acquisition of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against freelancers
Holt’s team should have been in the lead long before the match, as his directness put the Rangers in front of a wide variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but became slower in front of the gate, and then Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot far away after he was knocked out to hit Craig Halkett's head shot at the gate.
The hosts were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, as they knew they could hamper the guests in standard situations.
This is how the decisive gate came to pass.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston prepared a chance where Declan Gallagher and Robinson put Menga in a shooting position together, which shot the goal with a ball contact from the middle of the prison room.
In this phase, the Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball, but were unable to overcome the host's defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unaffected.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend.
Scott Pittman was fired by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow slipped the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
Flanks were repeatedly brought back into the Livingston Penitentiary and were regularly taken out of the danger zone, while two required penalties — one from Halkett against the replaced Glenn Middleton and one for hand-play — were refused.
“Phenemonal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally excellent and have once again exceeded expectations in this upward trend.
Their way of playing and their team have barely changed since they returned to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has been waking up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on top throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at Gerrard’s time, they couldn’t reach this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they could penetrate the hosts’ team – and that’s like a wake-up call for the rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), smiling faces and blue sky prevailed when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security grounds for discouraging a 25,000-strong crowd of people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – were also able to hear, condemning Erdogan’s policy as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, praised by some German Turks as a hero and mocked by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car collision in London.
The collision occurred at around 10:15 UTC near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a bustling street in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and sanitizers took care of the man who died at the scene.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had died in an accident with a driver fleeing in Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometres from the accident on Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and notify his closest relatives.
Roadblocks and redirects for buses are set up, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Officials Injured in Unrest
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in riots in a high-security prison for men.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 British time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and still stop.
Specialised Tornado officials were added to end the riots involving eight inmates and limited to one wing.
Officials were treated on site for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel were employed to correct an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to clarify that the officers will be handed over to the police and possibly spend longer time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was treated after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, deployment officers were called to the prison to take action against serious unrest, in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with fluttering floods (dry areas may benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move over the desert-characterized southwest and carry the risk of flooding with them.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings against flooding on Monday and Tuesday from west of Arizona to south and east of Nevada, as well as southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on Monday night and move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have come close to Phoenix as a tropical storm or tropical depression up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometres of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation with isolated up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert-characterized southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely to be possible and insulated up to 10 centimeters in total.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the rains associated with roses can be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although flooding is of great concern, this rain is likely to be partly useful as drought is presently prevailing in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least 40 percent of Arizona experiences extreme drought, the second highest category.
First, the hurricane path means that Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Then the hurricane will move to the north with 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and thereby weaken.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to land in Mexico in the afternoon or evening with the strength of a tropical storm.
Rainfall can be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, precipitation is expected to be 7.5 to 15 centimeters, with up to 25 centimeters possible,” weather.com reported.
Subsequently, Rosa will move as a tropical storm north across Mexico, reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move up through Arizona until late Tuesday night to the south of Utah.
“The main danger is expected to be very strong rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the desert-characterized southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
As a result of these precipitations, life-threatening floods and waterborne sludge are expected in the desert, as well as droughts in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After finding a 16-year-old with stitches in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday at 4:00 UTC in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to the police of Avon and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Bidstock area.
Officials asked everyone who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “under the commons, the rage” of the Democrats.
“A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the scrupulous and unheard-of tactics of Democrats,” Trump said in a statement in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered "under the commons, the rage" of Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh said in front of Congress on Thursday and rejected the accusation raised by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually harassed them decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also spoke at the hearing about her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw that day the brightness, quality and courage of Kavanaugh.
“A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in the service of the general public,” he told the crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of the Republican voters' participation in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our lives.
I’m not joining, but in reality I’m joining,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump argued that the Democrats see their mission as “resisting and blocking.”
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday, a senior GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, death toll rises
According to authorities, at least 384 people were killed on Saturday, many of whom were flooded as giant waves hit the beaches due to a strong earthquake and tsunami on Indonesia’s island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a party on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to six meters high hit the beach, killing many people and destroying everything that was on their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the threat of the tsunami came up yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately run away from it, and they fell victim to it,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster protection agency BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, it floated cars, tree trunks and houses, it landed everything,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had been pulled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have climbed trees on the escape from the tsunami and have survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centers in Palu.
Air footage released by the Disaster Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further earthquakes.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released during the massive earthquake on Friday corresponded to the 200-fold energy of the atomic bomb thrown on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have grown larger, the authorities said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found among the ruins of collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage along the coast could have been higher 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala near the epicenter of the quake.
Communication with Dongala was completely halted, according to Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the authorities were repeatedly criticized for not informing them that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves reportedly arrived at the time of warning.
Amateur footage posted on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building who desperately calls people on the street under him to warn of the imminent tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall strikes the shore and floats buildings and cars from it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a massive power outage that interrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The city’s airport will remain closed until October and has only been reopened for relief measures.
A visit by President Joko Widodo to evacuation centers in Palu was planned for Sunday.
The number of tsunami casualties has risen to more than 800.
The location is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the staff are housed in tents in the inner courtyard of their office, but, according to Dosebas, they passed through the scenes of the devastation.
“They told me they had seen many destroyed houses,” he said.
The location is very bad.
Even when the aid groups started with the hard task of launching disaster relief, some monetized that specialist foreign aid would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and staff from abroad are only possible if the location of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened so far.
“At the moment, it is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.”
While the second night since the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing hoped for one of the wonders that illuminate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewage duct.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped in ruins next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Paragliding National Team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
Others who were incarcerated at the Roa-Roa Hotel were, as Mandagi added, his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the Roa-Roa hotel crash under the paragliders took place, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach party.
However, his messages led to only gray question marks instead of blue check boxes.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal <0x24>26,750 while filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport police on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee, a Brink employee was robbed of <0x24>26,750 while replenishing a cash machine.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to make more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, “a man ran up behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag full of money for the machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the incident, but the police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information about the identity of the suspects will be asked to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (the being officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He appears in the show as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has cancelled for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only an abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has a religious significance for the West.
“I think ‘yee’ is the word most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said in a conversation about his album with radio moderator Big Boy this year.
“So I am you, I am us, I am us.
Kanye, which means “the only one,” became just “yes” – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album is a reflection of what we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West had previously collaborated, has already written his name with and without alphabets and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO pledges not to use the military against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military violence against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of the bloody repressions against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza that “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing 300 people, during which time left-wing student movements were about to establish themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans through monthly scholarships for students and the opening of further free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of training opportunities led young people to criminal ties.
U.S. Should Double Financial Resources for Artificial Intelligence
Given China’s increased artificial intelligence activity, the U.S. should double its research spending in this area, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI practitioner who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, even though the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: the country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given the fact that all the other countries are so far behind the US, we are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Doubled funding could double the chances that the next major AI success in the U.S. would be achieved, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an IA system that defeated the highest-ranked American Othello player, later being a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google Branch in China.
Lee honored previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge (DARPA) and asked about the time of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state subsidies.
“It is not China that takes away the academic excellence, but the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired coryphants from universities to work on AI.
In Lee’s opinion, a changed U.S. immigration policy could also support U.S. AI efforts.
“I think that people who are promoted to AI should be offered greencards automatically,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council of State presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lee, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances individuals to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations donating funds to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and science will be involved, and the White House announced the establishment of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment this month in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than <0x24>100 million annually in AI research.
In the meantime, nothing has been done to U.S. laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would entail a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim arises on the Greek territory. Therefore, Greece has vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign raises doubts that the electoral participation will reach the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot read: "Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote result is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said they would stick to the result so that it is decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the polling rate was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 percent of registered voters voting.
“I’m here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko will vote in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018, in a referendum on the change of country name that would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised capital, not through the rear entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe there will be a large majority for this, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
According to him, a “yes” result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required electoral participation.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would say yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral share must be 50 percent plus one vote.
Failure of the referendum would be the first severe blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since its takeover in May last year.
View: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvered through the entire Brighton defense to reach goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overtook Manchester City's Brighton defense at Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
Aguero made his hit in the 65th minute look ridiculously easy.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He rallied between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then looked around with four green shirts.
He played around a defender and then overhauled several other defenders on the edge of Brighton's penitentiary.
Then he shot a passport to the left at Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the prison room to play the ball back to Aguero, who with his right shoe overturned Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan and shot to the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were talking about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he reached a goal at the moment.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steering pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to drive sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net just before it dropped out.
City will play in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the Rockies game
Since the nationals are excluded from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force a further bet.
However, the ever-powerful joker hopes to stand on the hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if this is relevant for the Rockies who have a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies scored at least one wildcard with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we can play for nothing, we can at least throw away because we know the atmosphere with the audience here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why shouldn’t I participate in this competition?”
The nationals have not yet announced a startup for Sunday, but are reportedly prone to throw jokes in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starter, practiced in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander has a statistic of 18-7 this season, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds public hearing in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation in connection with the Supreme Court's elected Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican voters' participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our lives.
That’s one of the big, big ones – I don’t join, but in reality I do, that’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means, you see the commons, the disgust.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we won’t give them.”
The Democrats, he said, see their mission as “resisting and blocking.”
“And you’ve seen this in the last four days,” he said, describing the Democrats as “wrong and common and disgusting and dishonest.”
He named the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate Justice Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which sparked loud whispers in the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document get out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, oh no, I’m waiting for you one—that was really bad body language—the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour no longer accepts all opinions.
The party is intolerant of those who say their opinions.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to tame me, it didn’t come as a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour Members to be told that they are not welcome – just because we are speaking our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly as she had vigorously stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for representing a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues, on which Jeremy did not have an opinion with former top politicians.
The announcement of the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday stated that “the meetings should be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the Friday night GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour MP were exactly that.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings are not marked by this tone, and the promised "more friendly, more cautious" policy has long been forgotten when it has ever started at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differing views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is judged by whether it is accepted by the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a party leader, and colleagues with whom I previously believed to share similar political views now expected me to take a turn and take positions with which I would otherwise have never agreed – whether it be with regard to the national security of the euro area or with regard to the national security of the euro area.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say –, there’s a chimpanzee on social media that calls for my election, alarms the political centre and says that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better off than some of my colleagues, because the comments I make are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a daily flood of sexist or racist insults and yet never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that deceptions have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week called for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to apply, and with every mistrust proposal and every change in the electoral rules, the party becomes tighter.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to take my head off and not express my opinion so clearly, then I would “have no problems”.
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since 32 years ago as a student, caused by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which has literally caused my classroom in the general school to fall apart, to join the Labour Party, I have been inclined to provide better public services than advice for those who are most in need of them.
I have never made a helm from my political point of view, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear about my political positions and areas where I do not agree with the current leadership.
I just want to say the following to the supporters of Friday’s application: given the fact that the country is racing on a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I do not address this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, regardless of whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that I will not be distracted by all the threats or political intentions that I have in mind.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: Unsuccessful Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the end result slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tennant's Premiership.
They are now the only of the ten teams to be at the top of the table.
Ultimately, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as their better chances, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far, and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie von Melrose said: “Recognition for Ayr, they have better exploited their chances than we have.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Climo, led Ayr, but Melrose was unable to get a veruhh, and Jason Baggot, due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors.
Climo expanded Ayr's leadership with a penalty kick before hitting right in the middle of the season and then in the end achieving an increased test so it stood for Ayr at the 17:5 break.
Melrose, however, started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, boosted by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Thereafter, there was a prolonged interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out by the field. After the continuation, Ayr expanded his lead by an increased attempt by Stafford McDowall by Climo.
Then Blair Macpherson, who served as Ayr's captain, was given a yellow card, and again at the end of a phase, Melrose paid the extra man a non-increased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson got out of the penalty box from a touchdown behind the forward Ayr package.
Climo increased as almost since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's boxkick and sent flank player Gregor Henry to the home team's fifth attempt.
"Still Game" star appears ready for new career in gastronomy
“Still Game” star Ford Kieran appears to be ready for a shift into the hospitality industry after it turns out that he was named as the CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, whose screenplays he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow’s “flowering restaurant store.”
“The Sea Belongs to Us”: The country’s incarcerated Bolivia hopes that a court will open the way for him to the Pacific
Marines patrol in front of the Marine Headquarters in La Paz, decorated with taurine.
There is a blue flag in public buildings.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
Reclaiming it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the coastal section of Chile lost in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is as alive as the desire to drive again across the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a judgment of the International Court of Justice to be approved on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and calmness and expects the result, of course, with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will follow the IGH’s ruling on large screens in the hopes that the court in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia’s claim, according to which Chile is obliged, after decades of sporadical talks, to agree on sovereign access to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial fight for his re-election next year, is also at stake in the verdict on Monday.
“We’re just about to go back to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that little will change as well.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands is not authorized to speak on Chilean territory, and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, the judgment of the IGH, six months after the final plea, suggests that the case was “not complicated”.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also mean a rebound.
“The current Bolivian government has raised the issue of access to the sea in itself,” Zárate said.
She suggested that Morales' war rhetoric had suffocated any remaining goodwill in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue their talks, but after these events, this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltsé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court’s decision had fallen unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia has "an extraordinary opportunity to inaugurate a new era of relations with Chile" and "a chance to end the 139-year-long disputes for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – uses the theme of the sea as a political bridge.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“Judging is a chance to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament only takes place if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Mr Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of rivals in Singapore.
His statements come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be more than three months after the summit with North Korean President Kim Jong-un in Singapore shortly before re-established nuclear diplomacy.
Ri referred to the idea that further sanctions and the U.S. resistance to a declaration to end the Korean War would ever force the North on its knees as a “brain spine”.
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the statement without Pyongyang taking major disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris showcase the latest collections for huge headdresses that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you don’t have to look anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed on the run a range of crazy oversized headwear for their 2019 summer collection that fascinated the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their astonishing creations across the runway.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige hat with a spring-like wide edge that pushed the models’ heads straight.
Other over-dimensional accessories have been shown with jeweled watermelons, a wizard hat and even an ananas, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stitched lips and had more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than to Haute Couture.
One creation looked like a diving equipment, including snorkeling and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you are lucky.
Fashion observers predict that the huge head coverings could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The over-dimensional hats follow directly on "La Bomba", the 60-centimeter-wide hood that all wear from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat, which hit big waves in social media, sent another great creation over the runway: a beach bag made of straw, which was almost as large as the model wearing a bathing suit that held the bag.
The bast bag in red orange with bast french and a white leather heel was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus’ summer 2019 collection “La Riviera” at Paris Fashion Week.
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets next summer. The designer has been so excited that the demand for over-dimensional accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Language Skills for World Citizens Essential
Schottland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence, which continued with outstanding exam results in 2018 and is supported only by individual and joint achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest possible level of care for their students and their parents.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and popular in schools as electives.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language that he understands, you get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is an impressive reminder that we can not only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current results of this year’s exams show that languages with the highest livelihood rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved the A grade in the higher exams.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students in Mandarin achieved the grade A in the higher exams, while 72 per cent of students who learned German, 69 per cent of students who did not learn French, the Spaziers, the Students and the Students 63 per cent.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that will undoubtedly need children and young people in the future.
Languages are today considered as elective subjects as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, engineering, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17 per cent of the reasons employers cited for the problems of occupying open positions were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative when it comes to preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more open positions require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people an advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct an interview, and French was spoken as the only language of a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
That’s why it’s important for today’s children to invest in language lessons now.
Children who speak multiple languages, especially languages from developing countries, will have a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages will be taught that look to 2020 as the most important for the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests lie, there will always be a number of languages available at independent schools with appropriately specialized teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, no matter what the future looks like.
At this point in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of elementary importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as an "international ability to communicate."
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is Head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron on Sunday's Lakers debut in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James perform for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game of the pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
How many minutes he will play is not yet clear.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably only play a few minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked after training according to his plans for the Lakers’ six-game pre-season game plan.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare myself,” he said.
Trump's Event in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will begin a series of campaigning events in Wheeling, West Virginia, this evening.
This is Trump’s first five public announcements scheduled for next week, including at well-thought-out locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the floating vote on the confirmation of his election for the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections in November as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress.
When will Trump’s announcement take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's announcement in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, 19:00 (Eastern Coast Time).
You can follow Trump's publicity in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, on allegations of sexual misconduct that were conducted in a tense atmosphere this week. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation will remain in the swamp for up to a week, while the FBI undersuits
However, the main goal of this protest series is to support Republicans who have to face a difficult November election.
President Trump’s campaign team told Reuters that these five demonstrations will be used next week to mobilize “volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is so important for his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible while the running campaign season is approaching,” a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to name him told Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania" could participate and report media outlets from Pittsburgh at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight.
The visit on Saturday is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come in to try to push him into the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Ready to Fight to Maintain Hope for Individuals on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds on Saturday afternoon, the four parties were probably exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The vibrating pendulum of the moment is a pure invention as a sporting concept, but one that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this one.
So where do you think the momentum is now?
“They were in the lead with six points, and now there are four, so I think that means a little moment for us,” said Jordan Spieth.
Europe is, of course, in advantage and is four points ahead, while twelve more follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can each show three out of four points.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the pitch to the green and goes on with a good example.
The guttural enthusiasm screams became louder over the course of his lap, as he dropped an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them, after he and Thomas had gone back two holes with two points.
His putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar cry, which makes it clear that the American team is not out of the game yet.
“I really have to get in and take care of my own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have been the only players to score more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas, and thus undoubtedly have written the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s unequal but sympathetic duo is at four out of four points and can do nothing wrong.
“Moliwood” wasn’t the only pair that didn’t beat a Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the rear nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the amount of leftovers underscore that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to seal a possible European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different holes simultaneously.
Speaking of European glory, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the four heroes of the morning who played alongside Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles at the front nine holes brought the Spaniards and the Swedes into a clutch that they could not overcome approximately.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the clutch.
The four and four pairs are fascinating because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or don’t give, and the way a strategy can change rapidly.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day, but this quarter-round has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the US, have doubted.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup on the last day with 10:6
Europe is 10:6 ahead of the U.S. after Saturday’s fourth and fourth quarters and is ahead of the Ryder Cup with a solid lead on the last day.
The brilliantly playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two wins over the difficult-fighting Tiger Woods and was able to book four points at Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, who wants to regain the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the fours in the morning against the failing American team and won the series by 3:1.
In the four games, the U.S. held more resistance and won two matches, but were unable to pick up the rest.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve singles played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational “Molliwood” weekend, won four points in their four opening matches as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fours, they harmonized perfectly and beat the enchanted Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who had slipped through two matches on Saturday, occasionally flashed his brightness, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven consecutively.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the four in the morning, returned to play the four games as partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris, not everything went according to their ideas.
The three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the record for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter for Spain and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 quarters after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only occurred twice that a team came back after going to the singles with a draw of four points, but as a title holder for Furyk's team, an indecision is enough to keep the trophy.
After being in second place for just two days, it doesn’t look like they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday in front of the United Nations that continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual general meeting that North Korea took “substantial measures in good faith” last year. For example, it stopped nuclear and missile tests, decommissioned the nuclear test site and pledged not to devote nuclear weapons and technology.
“But we don’t see a corresponding reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not unilaterally dismantle ourselves first.”
While Ri repeatedly relied on North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-wise" denuclearization procedure, in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement appeared to be significant insofar as it did not have a one-sided denuclearization that could not be done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S. president in office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim had pledged to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" to "de-nuclearize" the North Korean peninsula, while Trump's security was in anti-terrorism.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington opposes demands for a softening of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘first denuclearization’ and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and is even against the ‘declaration of the war sender’,” Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us to our knees is a brainspin of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not enter into plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed out at three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were the other party in the denuclearization issue instead of the US, it would not have come to the denuclearization of this Korean neck.”
Yet Ris’ speech differed tremendously from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the US mainland with North Korea’s missiles after “the evil president” Trump has drawn Kim as a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened last year with the “complete destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in terms of disarmament moves, but said there was still much work to be done and the sanctions until North Korea’s denuclearization remained in force.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeframe for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: “The enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must definitely continue vigorously until we have reached complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to financially wipe out Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he said on his departure from Pyongyang that progress had been made, only hours later, to be accused by North Korea of making “gang-like demands”.
North Korea pledged this month at a meeting with Moon to demolish a missile base and a nuclear complex if the United States took “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the targeted "appropriate measures" were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn to Sleep Enough in a Course
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students in elementary school get more sleep this year. This is a measure against the growing macho culture, to stay awake with caffeine and to learn all night long.
A scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is in his opinion the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep apnea on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I learning about it only now, in my last year?’
After her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
This year’s first course explained to students how the foundations of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the University’s health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, the students see the picture of a room in a living room and click on coffee plates, curtains, training shoes and books, where they get information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effects of lack of sleep on the sporting performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep withdrawal can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
They are then encouraged to reflect on their daily routines by using a map of the university premises with interactive symbols.
“We know that it will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health,” added Professor Czeisler.
The pride in pushing a “night layer” is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-growing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Ensuring enough good sleep should be the “secret weapon” of all students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said. In addition, weight gain could be avoided, as sleep withdrawal moves the brain into hunger mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course. He had graduated from one of his courses in his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study program before entering their studies at a competitive university.
On the recommendation of Professor Czeisler, students should put themselves in a wake-up call for sleep and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” resulting from electronic screens and LED lighting and can cause the circadian rhythm to get out of the rhythm.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor beats Gerrards players
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's defeat to Steven Gerrard's unanimous team meant a 0–1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to book their first outing victory since the 4:1-Triumph at St. Johnstone, but the Gary Holts team added Gerrard the second defeat in 18 games as a manager, so his team scored eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership with a distance of heart.
Menga met seven minutes before the half-time, and the inspiring poor Rangers didn’t seem to have a chance to compensate.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and lies just behind Hibernian in the Tor Difference.
The Rangers are also facing further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block due to a head injury.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which surpassed Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who took the Hearts one point last week, and should be thrilled to see how his well-trained team kept their opponents under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston achieved more if they had the ball.
They were supposed to reach a goal after just two minutes when Menga's first performance led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and shot next to it.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only pass through the rear pole.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than convincing in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter of an hour he should have received a penalty kick due to a clash between him and Steven Lawless, but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not make the Colombian appeals apply.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had barely had any trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's 34-minute hit may not match the game's course, it is not to deny that they earned him alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were unable to deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball at Scott Robinson, who kept quiet and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent for half-time, and the exchange almost immediately took effect when the wingman Morelos put in position, but the impressive Kelly ran out of his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to encourage the guests to play exactly the game that was theirs, with Lithgow and Halkett getting a long ball after each other.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the final phase, but McGregor stood up and defended Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball from the corner.
Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton also lately demanded a penalty kick for a crowd with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as geiger counter.
The geiger counter, which has since become the standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is that?”
Rogers: “This is a geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: “In fact, I hear a crack!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name still lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to “See” Detached Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy detached cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine helps the immune system to detect degenerated cells.
In the method, immune cells are taken from a patient, which are changed in the laboratory.
These cells can “see” a common protein of many cancers and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect dysfunctional cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
In the method, immune cells are taken from a patient, which are changed in the laboratory so that they can "see" the common protein HER2 in many cancers, and then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of various types of cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and intestinal cancers, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method, in which patients are taken immune cells and trained to attack cancer cells, has helped in the treatment of a leukemia type.
After performing at SNL, Kanye West released a pro-Trump tirade and wore a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was kicked out of the studio on Saturday Night Live after he praised far-reaching US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to run as presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a make-America-Great Again cap, he continued with a chimney cannon against the Democrats and stressed his support for Trump once again.
“I’m so often asked by whites, ‘How can you like Trump?’ he’s racist.
So if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began broadcasting with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's sponge track was not broadcast, it was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock wanted to have fun with the West release.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had difficulty behind the scenes because of his head covering.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out with the hat.”
You've bullied me!
And then they say I’m in a drowning area,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West goes on, "Do you want to see the drowning area?" He said, "He's going to wear my supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try it with love.”
His remarks triggered at least twice the crowd’s bells, and SNL collaborators were embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine: “It was still dead in the studio.”
West was late to be hired as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture titled "I Love It", in which he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the Conservative group TPUSA, tweeting: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU, YOU HAVE BENEFITED THE MASSE."
Talk show host Karen Hunter, however, tweeted that West is just himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, takes on an ideology that is harmful to my community and gives itself (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now "The being formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg wore the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the deceased music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince" (The Artist formerly known as Prince).

The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast on Monday.
The allegations are reviewed by the prosecutor’s office.
'Game of Thrones' star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as sword-swinging Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones”.
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying such roles on the screen would result in boys often having to feel strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believed something had gone wrong, and asked how the problem of toxic masculinity could be solved in the <0x23>MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, also 31, who was also involved in Game of Thrones, admitted that the solution to the problem was “very important.”
“I personally find the question very important at the moment what went wrong with masculinity,” he said.
“What have we taught growing men about the problem we are now observing?”
Harington believes that television due to its highly masculine characters may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street, giving the boy the feeling of having to embody this particular side of a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change that?
“Something went wrong with the young men.”
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series, he would not participate in prequels or sequels of "Game of Thrones" next summer. He has "enough battlefields and horses".
From November, Harington will be seen in a new edition of Sam Shepard’s “True West,” the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently claimed that the best thing for him was “Game of Thrones” that he had met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife on this show, so that’s how I got my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie played in the numerous Emmy Award-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820.000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
Unlike in the past, the transmission took place in the vast majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Compared to the year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT members is said to be widespread.
Based on the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees allowed GOP senators’ data to be browsed, criticizing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, contested allegations on Saturday that a member of her staff published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the MPs’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat expressed the view that the allegations of “ultra-right” experts and websites would be widespread.
“Lies, lies, and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information is intended to include the private addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published during a hearing of a Senate committee on allegations of sexual misconduct by an unknown person in the government district against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The publication took place after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was assigned to Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for browsing this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly triggered online criticism, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
“This dementia is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
People who are accused of something they haven’t done should not be angry.
You must not be contentious.
You must not question the reasoning of the prosecutor.
You have to be calm and relaxed.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing if that’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and prosecution authorities about these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are revealed, and that they are held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous for all members of my staff.”
“Johnny English – You only live three times” – weak espionage parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in every new British-colored film. This seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy franchise “Johnny English”, which in 2003 started with “Johnny English – The Spy Who Decorated It” – Johnny “began with” Jehnleb again in 2011.
Will an ironic self-parody on the issue of how obviously we are attested become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of Johnny English for scams has been extended for the second time, with his name signaling more than anything else that he is a general comedic creation for cinema visitors in non-English-speaking space.
Of course, he's again the tricked secret agent who bizarrely thinks he's cool and worldly, while in reality he's made of something Clouseau, a Mr. Bean's tip and a clack of this guy who's got a single note at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos behind relentless travelers and international secret agents that Atkinson played in the now forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor, and the rotor blades listened briefly to his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is up to date, but humor seems rather weak and oddly superfluous, especially because the “serious” movie series such as “007” and “Mission Impossible” now offer self-confident comedy elements.
The humor seems to be more directed at children than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy mischief isn’t as intrusive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film gigs in the role of bean.
The eternally current premise now is that the UK is in great danger.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the supersecret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents employed, very much to the disapproval of the serving agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and oppressed figure already standing before the complete collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Teresa May character, but the script does not give much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been detected and therefore she has to get someone out of retirement.
This includes Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a chic facility, but offers informal lessons at work as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, as English offers a “School of Rock”-like spying academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested Kumpan Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, an angry woman of higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who always make things terriblely wrong in the secret service of Your Majesty, are back in action when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously prosecuted by a charismatic tech billionaire, Jason Volta, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque dickheads: As a waitress disguised, they set a chic French restaurant on fire, they create chaos as they smuggle on Volta's luxury yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to try out a virtual home with the help of an Inn-Reality.
In this last sequence, all the records are drawn, but so sympathetic and funny it is, the subject is already covered in detail in children's television.
Pretty moderate fabric.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, “Can’t the British film industry Rowan Atkinson give a role that really fits his talent?”
Labour refuses to work on a plan after which the British will work four days a week, but will be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is set to consider a radical plan that provides for the British to work four days a week but be paid for five days.
The party wants to report that business leaders will pass on the savings achieved by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional free day to the workers.
This would give employees a three-day weekend, but would still get the same pay.
According to sources, the idea “fits” to the party’s economic agenda and to its plans to shift the balance in the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day week was advocated by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day working week is an endeavor consistent with the Party’s approach to restoring economic balance in favour of the workers, as well as the Party’s general industrial policy strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. Already during the 2017 general election campaign, the Green Party promised to introduce a 4-day week.
However, the approach is currently not supported by the Labour Party at all.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day week is not about party politics and it is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concretized at the Labour Conference last week his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “profiters” from public service companies.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not be able to recover their full share, as a Labour government could make “deductions” due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to recruit employees to the boards of companies and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of private companies’ equity to employees who collect annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy in 60 Minutes Newsmagazine on whether the FBI’s investigation into the Kavanaugh case could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment as judge to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the results of the authority could influence Republican senators to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring up anything that might ultimately change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I informed in the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this claim was made, and asked if he had done it.
He was determined, determined and incomprehensible.”
However, Graham’s voice seems to be stoned.
“My opinion is clear as to Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to blow up a bomb,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has vehemently disputed this," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all who called her couldn’t confirm it.”
It is now 36 years old.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty as part of this festival?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York City, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission – to combat poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which will be held for the seventh time this year, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to sharpen awareness of the event’s real goal: combating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place in 2012 for the first time, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group seeks to combat poverty by motivating more and more people to actively participate in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to complete a number of tasks, such as volunteering, communicating with a leading politician worldwide (by e-mail or phone) or similar measures – to get the money to pay for it.
How successful is the project, given that Global Citizen is still 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of setting up a cool free concert a meaningful way to convince others that it’s time to act, or just another case of so-called clickitivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Global Citizens announced that the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions from its supporters since 2011 and achieve various goals.
These actions are said to have helped to encourage leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than <0x24>37 billion that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its shares, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been paid off or acquired through fundraising.
According to the group’s estimates, the funds secured so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the The Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers who have committed to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to keep Rwanda with <0x24>35 million more than <0x24>4.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told a live show in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions, which called on the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project to reach 5 million women and children and provide food assistance.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely, the question of why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
They said, “It will be a long and difficult journey with heights and depths.
But like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year’s event in New York, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
U.S. could use navy for blockade purposes to prevent Russian energy exports – Interior Ministry
According to the Washington Examine, Washington can use the navy if needed, so that energy from Russia does not reach markets including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia's use in Syria is a pretext for exploring new energy markets. Russia is currently working at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
“I think the real reason for Russia’s use in the Middle East is negotiating new energy sales markets, just like in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can, together with the Navy, ensure that the sea routes remain open, and block them if necessary, in order to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that understands itself as the “voice of electricity consumers” in the United States.
He drew a comparison between Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are practically identical.
“The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said, calling Russia a “one trick pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made when the Trump administration was expanding exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and thus replacing Russia with the far cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “immeasurable” pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow, according to Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we are all of the opinion that energy should not be used as a means of exercising pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves,” Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The United States has received a counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), has called on the United States to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply,” said the board of directors of the BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants a 2020 presidential nomination to “exactly check,” says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would “exactly examine” a presidential nomination after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to “exactly examine” a presidential nomination after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is heading this country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump is dealing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren, in her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, did not take a leaf from the mouth.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that, of course, an FBI investigation was required before the vote.
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe they should run for 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent in favour of a potential candidacy, and 48 percent in opposition.
Other names of prominent Democrats to be questioned for a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden announced that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin speaks on Donald Trump rally about post-traumatic stress disorder, under which track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through when he comes back, all that can be felt by other families who feel the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds that our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as an “elephant in space” and said about her son and other war veterans that they changed back, that they would come back apart, that they would come back again and wonder if there is such respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military have given to the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a legal remedy for new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal remedy for the new U.S. policy that denies victims of gang activity or domestic violence to asylum.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a court expert statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker questioning the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal politics in August was not disclosed.
She reported that her partner "and his violent gang sons" abused them, but U.S. officials rejected their asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations that have major problems with criminal ties and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy lifted a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed illegal immigrants on the run from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignored decades of legislation at the state, federal and international level.”
“The Federal Act requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the respective facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle,” the court’s expert statement said.
The lawyers further argued in the statement that the policy that denies immigrants access to the country has an adverse effect on the U.S. economy, as immigrants could be employed rather than entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.
In June, Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges, fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs, no longer grant asylum.
“Asylum exists for all those who leave their homeland because they are persecuted or because of fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political belief,” the statement said.
It was never the plan by granting asylum to eradicate all the problems, even all the serious problems that people have to deal with every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the number of deaths in the race doubles over time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It’s all very tense,” says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, reassuring her young son in a rescue centre in the devastated downtown of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with the dead.
“Clean drinking water is scarce.”
Residents returned to their ruined houses to collect their most precious possessions and possessions while saving everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals who were damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were completely overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the ongoing heavy aftercare.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went too fast.
I think I was trapped under the walls that fell," he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s call for help, but then there was peace.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and son.
I can only hope that they are in a safe place.”
U.S. Ambassador Appeals China to Tyranny with “Propaganda Ads”
One week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused the country’s capital, Beijing, of pressing the U.S. for pro-gagan purposes.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid contribution to the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after accusing China of intervening in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, an accusation that opposes China.
Trump’s allegations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the U.S. election are in line with the announcement by U.S. officials to Reuters; a new phase of a escalating campaign triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to turn up ads to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an outgoing trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
China’s retaliation tariffs at the start of the trade war should meet exporters in countries like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor who largely exports agricultural products to China, said Beijing has damaged workers, farm owners and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a statement in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, is now doubling this tyranny by placing propaganda advertisements in its own free press in the United States.
“With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government is claiming the proven tradition in America of free speech and the independent press by shutting down the country’s paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, you will find in the newspaper kiosks here in Beijing only a limited number of opposition votes and not realistic reflections of the divergent opinions the Chinese might have about China’s disturbing economic development, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Communist Party of China,” he said.
He added that one of China’s best-known newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but did not name the name of the newspaper.
Republicans applaud voters for midterm elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, observers warn
Since many of the most influential Republicans have supported and defended candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of several allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a counter-reaction during the upcoming midterm elections, which could be especially for women.
The vote in this regard was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already stated that they will continue with a vote.
“These things cannot be done backwards,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill, said in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute lead is sufficient for an FBI investigation to ease angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what was yesterday, they don’t forget it tomorrow and not even in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, first advisor and national spokeswoman for the Progressive Group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate floor area shouted “November is coming!” when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to hold Kavanaugh’s nomination, and despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s statement, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer of the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among voters in suburbs and younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement, in which his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court’s candidate were detailed, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could be the result if the Republicans advance the confirmation.
“This situation is a mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the vote of the board, the final vote, or Kavanaugh’s review; it’s also about the way Republicans have handled it and how they have treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that has chosen Demokra.
However, the Americans seem to disagree on who they are supposed to believe because of Ford and Kavanaugh’s statements, with a slightly larger share on the latter’s side.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitively or probably convinced by Ford’s statement, while 35% said they were definitively or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
38% said they believe Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied about his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ford issued a defamatory statement that she was attacked by the drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had revealed his genitals to her when she was at a party during her studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently bringing a startup to the market with the aim of establishing a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open-source platform Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the intention behind the inrupt is the "world rule".
“We need to be active now,” he said on the topic of startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses the technology of Solid so that users can create their own personal online data storage or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other tools for the private and corporate sector.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in one browser and at the same time.
The particular thing about personal online data storage is that the user alone can decide who can access what data.
The company refers to this concept as personal reinforcement and development of data.
According to John Bruce, the company’s CEO, the idea is that the company uses resources, processes, and corresponding skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been hired to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers.
By the beginning of this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team would not exchange with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change would be made to completely reshape their entire business models overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been instrumental in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely confident about this new era of the web,” he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, carrier of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The Church of England’s only clergyman, who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant-Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award for his use in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sharpshooter and never learned that he had won the highest British wartime award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Sunday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, believed that this act was full of symbolic power, as the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann conducted his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin; through dense fog and under heavy fire of field guns and machine guns.
Later, he pushed forward to the line of fire, leading the line forward with the “best courage” before sniping off three of the military units with a field weapon in the front entrance.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918; just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were something he could never be justified with, and at the same time something that makes one humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a crown after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he feels very honored to be able to take part in the parade, adding that the courage of a real hero will become visible primarily through the support of many people.
MMA fans have stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you’ve been awake all night watching an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 battles, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the viewers in the UK were not surprised when suddenly Peppa Pig was seen.
Some remained untouched after being awake until the early hours of the morning to see the fight in particular.
A fan on Twitter described switching to the comic book character as a kind of bad joke.
“Due to a government regulation, these contents are classified as not youth-free, so they had to be switched to a children’s broadcast at 6 a.m.,” Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said when asked about the broadcast.
“Peppa, the pig, exactly.”
The company’s CEO, Scott Coker, announced that the company will be revising the expiration plan to take into account viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think the problem could have been solved in the replay,” he said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on a Sunday at the UK audience, and we won’t solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stay.
The exchange was pretty much communicated. It went very well and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem, and we have assumed that this is a technical failure.
What was not the case was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the whole thing to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual. And we've tried to give fans the best experience possible.
The whole situation is quite regrettable.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels “submissive” when it comes to sexuality
Tom Daley, who has been a water jumper at various Olympics, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at secondary school that he was different from others.
On the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, winning the Olympics is no longer so important to him.
The actual moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses due to illness for a few months.
In Laverne’s first broadcast, he said he considered himself inferior to others earlier, as the love of boys and girls was completely socially unacceptable.
To this day, “feeling inferior to others and being different from the others is the reason for my power and strength and ultimately my success.”
He wanted to prove that he is a very special personality so as not to disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medalist at the Olympics is a prominent LGBT activist today and used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he expressed his views on this issue because he is fortunately able to live without restrictions and without discrimination and want to give courage to others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The discovery of falling in love with a man was for him an absolute surprise.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference has never been a topic.
He says if you had to go through so much as a child and adolescent – he took part in the Olympics for the first time at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
The couple have had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley believes that his whole outlook has changed since.
Last year, it was all about gold medals.
But for him there is now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main win.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the imminent death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be on the front line.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only after that that that I finally realized that he was not invincible,” he continued.
The following year Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
“I just knew it was always my dream to dive in front of the local audience at the Olympic Games – that was crazy,” he said.
His first selection of songs – proud of Heather Small – was also influenced by this. He heard the song before the Olympics and still cared for goose skin.

Mickelson, who is not in shape at the moment, sits on the substitute bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to work hard not to make the whole thing a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the replacement bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of usually being at the center of the event, the five-time major winner spent his day firing on others and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus no ideal team for the narrow Le Golf National Golf course, where misguided balls are regularly penalized.
And as if the place itself wasn’t discouraging enough, Mickelson will meet perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, a new player in the tournament, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans set a hot start with a four-point draw in the 12 singles games, Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to it.
“He was perfectly clear about his role today, gave me a clutch on my back and put his arm around me and thought he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world-renowned personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t think he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s how it went, and that’s what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else.”
Mickelson will reach Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully matched the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 victories, had to score 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk said that his presence alone has enriched the team.
"He's funny and sarcastic, he's original and he likes to do some fun, and he's a great guy who's popular with the whole team," he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little closer this week, and it was fun to watch them.
He’s a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses.”
Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that the lead could be over soon
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great lead that leads to the last singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Danes made their debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but only barely reached the finish line and led with the smallest possible lead, achieving a win of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“The idea remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that was scarce,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn (pictured on the photo), after he saw the 5–3 victory at Golfster as well as Freita at the Class of 2018.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it’s not over.
It's going to be okay tomorrow.
Put yourself in the bag and do the right thing.
The whole thing is not over until the points are on the display table.
We have a goal, we want to win this trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I’ve always said that I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re completely clear about what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Glad about the performance his players have done on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never skip that.
Tomorrow will be another caliber.
Tomorrow, individual services are at the forefront and this is a completely different thing.
It’s great to work with a partner when things go well, but when you’re alone out there, you’re tested to the limits of your golfing skills.
You have to make it clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he also needs to get the best out of it."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure his players cut off better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those big turns on the last day of the tournament. He stood in Brookline on the winning side before he stood after Europe's "Wonder of Medinah" on the side of the losers.
“I remember every damn word,” he replied to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to take off the fast start you’ve seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum hits in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We put our team up accordingly and send our guys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of scoring, he must play in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the rankings.
“I’ve decided for the boys in this order because I think it covers everything,” Bjorn said of his selection for the singles.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace ships from the Cold War, but it will not be delivered until next year, according to local media, due to faulty systems and fast-growing costs.
The launch of the "Rhineland-Palatinate", the flagship of the brand new frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, was shifted to the first half of 2019 according to a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be put into service in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by worrying problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class, ordered by the Navy in 2007, are intended to replace the old fregates of the Bremen-Class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and naval aircraft, as well as Tarnt technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature are longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the continuing delays can lead to the fact that the state-of-the-art warships that Germany is supposed to represent as a sea power are already outdated at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
The F125 frigate, which was followed by the accident, entered the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a series of significant “software and hardware errors” that would have rendered the new ship unusable in a battle situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class are served by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older fregates of the Bremen-Class.
It was also known that the ship is much too heavy, which leads to power cuts and prevents the Navy from carrying out rearmament measures in the future.
The 7,000-tonne heavy "Rhineland-Palatinate" was apparently twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, also became a problem.
Apparently, the costs rose to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that the German naval power is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag’s defence commissioner, confirmed that the navy “takes out the operational ships”.
Bartels said that the problem grew with time, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were delivered.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Fleece Mouse
In a property in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being carried out to show how frog mice use the landscape in food search.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insight into the behavior of these unique flying mammals, helping to lead future nature conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track dwarf and mosquito-fly mice as well as the brown languor and water-fly mice in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of the Fledermaus throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
A sound analysis of all recordings by experts determines the frequency of flutter outs and determines which species does what.
Then a map and a report of the habitat are created to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This data will help determine the benefits of habitat management measures, such as the creation of meadows, and show how to obtain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Flemish stocks in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which affects beds and leads to the loss of living space.
Windwheels and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Flea mice are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey because of their night hunting habits.
They use a sophisticated echo to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the topic of Fledermaus very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out inspections, inspections of sleeping places, and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only frog reserve at Threave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s 10 frog species.
Property manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal living space for them.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for frogs,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living space.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about flutter mice yet, so we’re doing this work here and on other goods that will help us learn more about what flutter mice need to feel comfortable.”
He stresses how important it is to exclude the presence of molluscs before maintenance work in the goods, as it is possible that the unintended destruction of a single nest site could kill up to 400 females and boys and eradicate the entire population on site.
Flemish mice are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: “We still have a lot to learn about frogs and many of our species don’t know what their populations are like.”
Ronaldo dismisses rape allegations while his lawyers want to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape allegations “fake news” and said people want to be “famous” by using his name.
His lawyers are planning to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The striker of the National Team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her <0x24>375,000 to buy her silence about the incident, The Mirror said on Friday.
In an Instagram live video of his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports “Fake News.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous by my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror for the allegations they described as “inadmissible reporting on suspicions of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player demanded compensation for “moral damages to an extent corresponding to the severity of the violation of law, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident was reported to have occurred in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 2009.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped them, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was “99 percent a good guy” who was “one percent replaced.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that the two had sex, but say it was agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement as she had “fear of revenge” and was concerned about being “publicly humiliated”.
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to cancel the deal, as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was just about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident, and this summer he switched to Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: the UK would 'forever regret' the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would “forever regret it” if it lost its status as a world-leading car manufacturer after Brexit, according to Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He said it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that production at the Derby plant in Burnaston would be interrupted prematurely if the UK should leave the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis lines, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that in an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March we will experience production stops at our plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a harsh EU exit without an agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its mini factory in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main concerns, according to car manufacturers, are linked to risks within the supply chain in the event of a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s production facility is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to manufacture the cars on demand.
Should the UK leave the EU on March 29 without an agreement, there could be interruptions at the borders, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and gaps in the parts.
It is impossible for Toyota to keep a warehouse in the Derbyshire plant that lasts longer than one day, the company said.
Clark explained that Theresa May’s Chequers plan on future relations with the EU “is precisely designed to avoid such checks at the border.”
“We need a deal, we want the best deal, which, as I said, allows us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue with very successful supply chains so far.”
Toyota could not specify how long production should be interrupted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is the top official of the Unite trade union at work, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience of these jobs never comes back once they’re gone.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed by another week" as the dispute over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein has supervised the work of Special Investigator Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s election interference, ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, as well as a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Justice Minister and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for a month.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein claimed the possibility of secret recording his talks with Trump as well as the president’s resignation using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies the report.
However, he entered the White House last Monday, while new reports of his alleged resignation were announced.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was at the UN General Assembly in New York at the time, was announced for the coming Thursday,
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, were exonerated.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
In response to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “A date has not yet been set, and it could be this week, but I can still imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
It will show up, but I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some reporters would probably contradict this claim: Sanders hasn’t held a White House press conference since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences does not lie in an aversion to the TV reporters’ “effect hashing,” but admitted: “But I wouldn’t argue that they operate effect hashing.”
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president makes more question-and-answer rounds than any president before him,” she said, without providing accurate evidence: “We’ve looked at these figures.”
“There will still be press conferences,” Sanders said, “but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it will be much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, and you have seen that we have done this often in recent weeks, which will take the place of a press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with attending dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is so, when he put down a run-out and sometimes bizarre performance in front of crowded reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU employees of Scottish NHS due to Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health addresses people from outside the EU who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and wish to remain in the country even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the exit negotiations between the UK and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the British government has also strengthened preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of what disturbing times these must be for all of you.
That is why I once again wanted to express how much I contribute to the value of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie suffered a head injury after surgery
Tennessee State Tigers Tigers Christion Abercrombie reportedly underwent an emergency surgery after a head injury he suffered on Saturday in the 31-27 defeat against Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-life break.
“He came to the sideline and just broke down there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff supplied Abercrombie on the sideline with oxygen before being put on a carrier and transported for further examination.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the OP at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details about the nature or extent of the injury are yet to be known” and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called red shirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, increasing his total number in the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for real estate purchases in the UK
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK in the future. The additional income will benefit, according to the new plans of the Conservative Party Homeless
This step is intended to curb Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will apply to all those who do not pay any taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects multiple revenues of up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, with multiple incomes to benefit the homeless.
This step is an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters, who promises to provide more affordable living space and take on top earners.
The increase in stamp tax will be collected on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom. The additional income will be contributed to the government’s campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which will be raised in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago on second-family apartments and residential properties left for rent, could amount to up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects through the move multiple revenues of up to 120 million pounds per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by investors not based in the United Kingdom, which drives prices upwards and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get their foot in the real estate store.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "spirit cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new strategy follows just a few weeks after Boris Johnson voted to cut the stamp tax to allow more young people to have their first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain’s “habitation scandals.”
Opposition leader Corbyn announced an astonishing number of proposals for housing reforms ranging from a rental price restriction to a ban on premises for no good reason.
He also wants to give city councils more power to build new apartments.
“Last year, I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, according to which life should be better from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live and work here and build a life.
However, it may not be as easy for people who do not live in the UK as it is for companies based abroad to buy real estate, as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of homelessness has become far too far for many people, and the indecency of homelessness continues to be a too big problem.”
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it’s his ‘big goal’ to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish has the challenge of bringing a new life to the Northeast England club, which is in third place in League One and lacks three points at the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I did it on the bank and it was,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sports Sound.
“But as a child, I’ve often seen Scotland play in Hampden with my father, and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in the management of the club.”
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic admitted not to be afraid to step into the footsteps of such established names at such a club after he previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at the moment by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
"Given the structure and possibilities in this club, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably consider my time here as a success only if I brought the club back there.”
Ross can only have a three-year management career, after a period as deputy manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month career as a coach in Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and halved St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“That was probably a real divorce,” he recalls when he assumed responsibility for Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than just playing.
It sounds funny because I didn’t get a bad job, could live well of it and experienced some very pleasant high-phase.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things to go through every week.
I still do this because of the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I've done it. I've never felt so comfortable in my skin in my whole life as an adult."
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, September 30th between 12:00 and 13:00 BST at Sportsound on Radio Scotland.
The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a study
The heatwave in the summer has missed the revenues of Britain’s crumbling pubs, while restaurant chains are under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded a sales growth of 2.7 per cent in July, but revenues at restaurants declined by 4.8 per cent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, which compiled the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s continued participation in the football world championship longer than expected meant, however, that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, in which pub’s sales increased by 2.8%.
The decline of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed the best performance, with a surface-cleaned turnover that rose higher than it dropped at restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
It looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent per month, while food sales decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, analyst for the RSM leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, but revenues of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful compared to the previous year in addition to the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators with a focus on food, and it remains to be expected if the moderate temperatures in August will provide the urgently needed breathing breaks."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including reopenings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A study shows that one in five children, some just 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that keep it secret from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools found an increase in so-called “fake insta” pages
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main account” to show it to their parents.
One in five children, some just 11 years old, create accounts on social media that can keep it a secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at further schools showed a rapid increase in so-called “Fake Insta” accounts, an acceleration to Instagram’s photo-sharing website.
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of students said they owned a clean “main account” that they could show to their parents, but also own private accounts.
A mother who fell on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged the other to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are being tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be "Voice of the Athletes" at the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the council of the Scottish Athletics Rooftop Association.
Doyle is Scotland’s most frequently awarded lightweight athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for sports executives to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is respected in the lightweight community of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that lightweight athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their election to the Council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can make a real contribution and start sports in Scotland.”
The American who won the distance over 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, a total of four Olympic gold medals, and now frequently appears as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a premature bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell me whether or how far I will be healed.
It was hard work, but I have completely recovered, learned to run again and do exercises today!
Thank you very much for the encouraging news!”
An advertisement for dairy pumps that compares mothers with cows creates excitement on the net
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided excitement in the network with an advertising clip, in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to breastfeeding cows.
In order to launch the world’s first low-noise portable milk pump, consumer technology manufacturer Elvie released a music video that is not very serious to emphasize the freedom that the pump gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hedgehog filled with cows in the background to a song that contains lyrics like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see a dick in me" or "if you haven't noticed, it's not just my breasts."
“Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page has sparked controversy on the network.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video encountered mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom say that it harmed the “terrors” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys will be taken away from them within a few days after birth.
Elvie's milk pump fits discreetly in a Still-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment reads: “Implicitly traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: “So a strange advertisement.”
Others defended the advertisement and a woman admitted that she found the song "urcomic".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping out, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I’m not trying to over-interpret it.
It’s a great product,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that they all danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use milk pumps tend to feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely soundless, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly in a still-behind bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative market launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the challenges associated with them, while presenting in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that enables the new pump.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump has gone into the headlines.
During London Fashion Week for designer Marta Jakubowski appeared a double mother on the catwalk,when she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent town on the Texas border.
The number of incarcerated migrant children is as high as ever, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, among other things, as the tightened rhetoric and measures of the Trump administration have made it difficult to accommodate children in caretakers.
Traditionally, most caregivers were even illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become even the target of an expulsion when they sign up to adopt a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to leave their fingerprints and that this data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority, told Congress that the authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The authorities later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no previous entries in the criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either self-caregivers or members of a caregiver’s household are illegally staying in the country, and a large proportion of them are convicted foreigners.
That is why we will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In order to be able to process cases of children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that, according to the staff of the accommodations of some children, require that they appear before the court within a month instead of 60 days after their custody, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via video and not in person to appear before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In case of negative decisions, the person will be dismissed quickly.
The longer these children stay in custody, the more likely it is, according to the accommodation staff, as well as reports known in the last month from the system, that they become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to break out.
Defenders say these concerns are reinforced at a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems being easily overlooked due to the size.
They also explained that there could be traumas that many of the children already suffer if they were brought to a tent town without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country’s civil war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally located on Syrian soil and “treated accordingly” with the pretext of combating terrorism.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions more have been expelled from their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus "will continue this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleaned" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has stationed about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, training and advising mainly Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs recruited against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were given, and he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that the refugees were preventing them from going home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make it possible to return home,” he said.
“They are politicizing a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union warned that no construction aid will be granted to Syria as long as there is no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel high city of Idlib was an opportunity for the advancement of political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey targeted a wide-ranging offensive of the Russian-backed Syrian forces against the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including by fighters of the al-Qaeda allied Nusra Front, will be “deleted”.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem called the conditions of the Syrian government for participation in the committee and declared that its work should be limited to “revision of the articles of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal spectators probably hope, end a vacancy or a scandal of his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time.”
So far, there is no indication that the audience is tired.
Since 2014, CNN’s best broadcasting time has more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers for the best broadcasting time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led the activation rates to be 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
“It’s like a fire that magically attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series “Designated Survivor” aired on ABC, about a cabinet member who becomes the president after an attack destroys the capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-fashioned comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, the stories from Washington, in contrast to what is on television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible family reunification and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it’s about being an informed citizen, if you become aware of having watched Daniel’s six-hour expert tour, which is about Bob Woodward’s use of sources from the so-called “Deep Background” for his book “Fear”, Paul Manafort’s “Diskwired” by Trump, the <0x24>15,000 worth of booby bullets.
For my part, I will never be able to see Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“Part of what he’s doing feels like a reality show he imagines every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series “The Three of the Panda House,” about Trump’s rotational occupation and daily unrest of the NFL’s footage.
You can’t afford to miss a consequence, otherwise you won’t come with it anymore.
When I reached meat this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he broke in and watched MSNBC while simultaneously recording CNN.
He simply couldn't get out of the screen, not when Justice Brett Kavanaugh stood just before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleischs told me.

The closest race to seats in congress in the midterm elections
It’s not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency is flooded with donations, thanks to the newly drawn boundaries of the constituency, which led to two officials racing around the same seat.
The newly drawn suburban district in Pittsburgh brings the Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in the course of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb is facing another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is strongly intersecting with the new 17th District.
The maps were re-drawn after the Supreme Court of the state of Pennsylvania in January ruled that the old districts violated the Constitution and were manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered an election campaign funding swap between the major financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was announced in Pennsylvania after a scarce victory in a well-respected special election in March around the state's 18th constituency.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and Trump won there with 20 percentage points of lead.
Politicians provide the Democrats with an easy guide.
The U.S. reviewed El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then retreated
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering much resistance from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization’s management team was thrown out.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to remove the heads of all U.S. foreign missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the ministry in a statement.
However, only in the case of El Salvador were penalties considered, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should follow a similar meeting last year and represented a step forward in efforts to deter migrants from moving towards the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and so effectively ended the consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now set to be a speaker at the conference set up in mid-October, according to diplomats, to set a mark on the importance that the Assembly’s government will bring.
The three U.S. diplomats are still and quietly returning to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new harsh announcements or sanctions from Washington.
A government spokesman from John Bolton declined an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to comment on the internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.
Their views were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learning from History
The next big surprise could be Special Investigator Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible judicial disability, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller is now allegedly also investigating whether Trump’s campaign team has conspired with Russia in its attack on the U.S. election.
Should the congressional majority change, Trump is confronted with an organ that forces him to hold accountable, precisely at the time he tries to stand before the voters again; and possibly before a jury.
These are many ‘whens’ and I don’t want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will affect how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d’état against Hitler if the West had simply resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the relentless march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump abandons Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides the future of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in Teufel’s kitchen since this newspaper reported last year that he proposed to secretly record the president and speculated that he was above unsuitable for the office.
Rosenstein denies the New York Times.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly-arranged FBI investigation is not complete or fair or is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and misrepresentation in office?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that forces Trump to hold accountable?
If we fail in these tests, we have a long winter ahead of us.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to ignite Sabbath hearts on the table with the hook cross.
How can I not be optimistic about this legacy?”

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimistic before the game against Vienna
The Rangers received Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive rematch against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for the Europa League Group G qualification.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans was unable to appear until the 2-2 draw against Villareal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a jumping board for bigger ones.
“This was an important point for us because Villareal is very good,” said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can make some out of it and we drove home with one point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall an indecision was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we stepped up in the second half and were then the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
I hope we get three points, but this is going to be a tough game, because they got a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we can do that with the audience behind us and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there’s some kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good on it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind and be successful.”
Fear of ageing leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to take care of it, few spoke to their family members about it.
Approximately half of the participants in the nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance party at Nationwide.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your advisor can also help you find a way to fund these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-producing life insurance to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Apply last-minute litigation.
Establish a precautionary authority so that you mandate a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health care professionals comply with your wishes, should you be unable to express it yourself.
Also consider an authority for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your invoices are paid, should you not be able to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication intake or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that play a role. Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.

Man shot in Ilfracombe multiple times with airgun
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he went home after a job with friends.
The victim, a man in the '40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shootings, which occurred around 2:30 a.m. British time, as a "voluntary act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police were looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the death toll is expected to continue to rise.
Because of the failed communications systems, auxiliary forces were unable to obtain information from the government district of Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district that extends northwest of Sulawesi Island over a coastal section of over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, lived an estimated 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the Central Sulawesi economy, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Protection Authority, Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996 that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Ring, and is regularly home to earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the western coast of Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 shook southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the South Coast and claimed nearly 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters in height that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the popular Indonesian island of Lombok and claimed more than 500 deaths, especially on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested on allegations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska’s former governor and former vice presidential candidate, was arrested on charges of bodily injury.
The 29-year-old Palin, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, disabling the reporting of domestic violence and resistance to state violence, according to a report published Saturday by the Alaskan police.
According to the police report, he took off the phone from a friend when he wanted to understand the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a <0x24>500 deposit has been collected.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where, when asked about his plea, he replied “Not guilty, absolutely certain,” according to the network.
Palin is accused of having committed three Class A offences, which can be fined with up to a year in prison and a fine of up to <0x24>250,000.
He is also charged with an offence of Class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the Alaska Veteran’s Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of the reporting of a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of beating her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations after she referred her son’s behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been interrupted and it is assumed that the number of deaths will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos are circulating from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutor Calls for Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New York Terror Attack
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York is demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the accused in the terrorist attack in New York City that cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a leased pick-up of the construction chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, during which he crashed on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, driving pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “targetedly” and “consciously” inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the statement of intent for the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal prosecution court filed a 22-point indictment of Saipov, which includes eight charges of murder against the background of organized crime, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of risk of organized crime, as well as a charge of rape and rape.
The attack requires “basic planning and intent,” the prosecutors, who described the manner in which Saipov carried out the act, described it as “abhorrent, cruel and corrupt”.
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco's damage, pain and loss as such,"
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the Southern District of New York has been chasing no more cases with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in New York at a federal offense was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union two years before the conspiracy.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified in the days and months following the attack of lack of remorse, according to court documents.
He told investigators what he had done to make himself feel good, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to do so after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, the indictment said.
According to police, he also demanded that the flag of ISIS be hanged in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said she was "obviously disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor's office.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of a confession of guilt in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of dismissal, will only prolong the trauma suffered by all participants,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative Party MP Calls for NIGEL FARAGE to Transfer Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize “the power of the people” today during a protest during the Tories Conference.
Ukip’s former party chief said politicians “must feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics, while a member of the Theresa May party suggested Farage should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbone Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be “already out” if Farage were Brexit ministers.
The challenge May faces in reconciling her deeply disputed party has been aggravated by the fact that members of her party who are for a stay in the EU participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The prime minister has trouble keeping her Chequers compromise plan on track despite attacks by Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that despite the counter-reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and “chaos”.
Bone explained at the ‘Leave Means Leave’ demonstration in Solihull that ‘Chequers belong to the garbage.’
He suggested that Farage be appointed as a peer and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for it, we would have been out there already,” he said.
Wellingborough’s MP added: “I will support Brexit, but chequers belong to the garbage.”
His opposition to the EU stressed: “We have not fought in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration, explaining to reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who actually walk the streets and make sure we are elected.
Please give up checkers and start listening.’
In a message to May, she continued, “Prime Ministers keep their jobs if you keep their promises.”
Farage said in a speech that politicians need to “feel the pressure” if they are on the verge of cheating the 2016 referendum decision.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“They’re trying to cheat on Brexit and that’s why we’re here today to tell them, ‘That’s not how you get out of it.’
“I want you to let our political class, which is just about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure,” he said.
“We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country, who will defeat us in the referendum and will never come to peace as long as we are not an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before a two-hour demonstration in the city centre.
A few activists swinged banners of the Tories Against Brexit grouping, a group of Brexit opponents within May’s party, which was launched over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, peer of the Labour Party, was joking about the Tories that had security issues with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, like all the technology for Canada Plus, are present for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” said Adonis.
“This is a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to ‘exactly examine’ presidential nomination
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “examine the presidential nomination” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke on Saturday at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts about her future.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is in a race for re-election to the Senate against Massachusetts MP Geoff Diehl, who was vice-president of Trump’s campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was the centerpiece of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was their 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump’s inauguration.
One of the people present asked her if she wanted to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to “go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.”
Arrested after shooting dead on LSU players Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the case of the deadly shooting on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims from Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man to be seen on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a shot in the head and died as a result of this injury," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to the sports media portal 247sports.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been at the crime scene and possession of a weapon and shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-metre Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and was able to average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Championship title after his team handed him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas landed in the qualifying before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' stallords would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position Bottas got a good start and it was almost as he led Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton crash into traffic at the end of the race, a decision that was supposed to be decisive.
The Mercedes went a round later into the box and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overcame him after a short wheel-on-wheel maneuver, in which the Ferrari pilot reluctantly released the inside, with the risk of resisting after two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen started on one of the backs of the field and was in seventh place on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for much of the race, holding on to his tires to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually entered the box in the 44th round and failed to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri has been doing an excellent job all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to get ahead of me.
The team has done a great job of achieving a double victory," said Hamilton.
A Case of Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump joked at an election campaign event on Saturday over Senator Dianne Feinstein, who insisted that she did not pass on to the press the letter of Christine Blasey Ford in which she accuses candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford did not directly address the statement before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that the proceedings in the Senate show that people are “general, mean, and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate over the last few days is that you see the anger when you see people who are angry and cowardly and mean and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at the leaks and then say, ‘Oh, I wasn’t.
I wasn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... You published the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a moment, please.
Did we... No, we didn’t publish it,” he added, imitating the senator’s voice.
Feinstein played the letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and it was released in early September, but Feinstein argues that the leak comes from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t publish your story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep the letter secret, and I answered her request for secrecy.”
Their dementia did not appear to be good for the president, who said at the election campaign event on Saturday night: “Let me tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continuous defense of the judge's candidate, who is accused of sexual assault by three women, the Democrats claimed that they would use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the community, the evil, they don’t care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars beat the Belfast Giants on Friday in the Elite League by a 5–3 win in the Dundee back game on Saturday.
The giants went to the lead early with two gates, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the balance for the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
This was unexpected for Adam Keefe's men who beat Dundee on Friday night 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League of the season.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a performance by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the performance when Beauvillier extended the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt left Cownie to his goal-match after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the half-time break, when he reached his second goal of the evening just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard scored again with a power play match in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time late in the second half, then Nielsen secured his team victory with a fifth goal after almost half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home on Friday at Milton Keynes Stadium.
Flightless man died after he was sure that hundreds of people in a plane escaped from the earthquake
A flight attendant in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found his death to safely launch a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken by a devastating earthquake on Friday that triggered a tsunami.
Strong quakes are still felt in the region and many people are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the highly fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to make sure that Batik Air’s flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was going to crash.
Agung later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for the Indonesian Aviation Security Service, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia’s ABC News.
“We deployed a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message,” he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death toll could rise to several thousand, and the country’s Disaster Protection Authority stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is expected to increase as many bodies are still under the debris, while others cannot be reached,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves up to 6 meters in height have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial airplanes bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
“Supermarkets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy now, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech before the country’s military: “I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was devastated by an earthquake in Lombok this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now reports missing after plane crash in Laguna
The airline carrying out the flight, which crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, is now reporting a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they could not say anything until Saturday afternoon about the stay of a passenger.
The airline agreed to work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but were in stable condition.
The cause and exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed just before the landing track in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying out of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very flat.
“That’s a very good thing,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wait for the emergency exits on the sides of the plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors who were working close to improving a landing site were hurried with an inflatable boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people were killed in crashes of airline companies registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution closed its trial on Saturday in the re-negotiation of a case in which a man is accused of banning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He told the jury how he reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he had received location data from various phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, which contradicted his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford came to witness on Saturday and said that he had not been to the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had said the truth when he claimed to have been in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said he had lied "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another objection was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers at the time of her death for two weeks.
However, cell phone records indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis removed their messages, calls and contact information from his phone some time after Chambers died.
“He took it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin its plea on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will then go before the jury on that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?

The High Breed from Bristol claim that Hip Hop has removed its roots from its political message and social commitment.
They want to get back to their roots and make socially conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the United Kingdom by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New Yorker girl sues couple for ‘racist’ SMS fire
A New York babysitter sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother that she was "another black woman".
The couple struggled to be racist and compared the legal dispute to an “oppression”.
The double-mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her shock when she found out that the new day mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEEIN, NOT A SHOWER,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending this message to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After recognizing her fake passport, Plasco’s “concerned” fluxman Maurice quit, claiming that the open African-American day mother had done poor work and she was expecting a Filipino woman instead.
Maurice was paid for her workday and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal and is claiming compensation for the <0x24>350 per day, which she would have lasted for over six months the job for which she was originally booked, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
“I want to show you, look, that’s not what you’re doing,” she told the newspaper on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple rejected the allegations of racism, arguing that the dismissal was the sensible step because they feared Maurice would not be able to trust them anymore after they had insulted them.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was accidental?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to an "oppression" and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was "in a difficult situation".
“Do you want to attract such a person?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
As the legal dispute continues, the couple was quickly condemned in public and advertised on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not identify with a speaking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said of the letter: “It is difficult to translate into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it’s very funny with our knowledge of Paddington’s huge success today.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the children’s book, had no problem with it, his work would have been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the release was “after his death.”
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington’s success, which she describes as “a very important family member.”
“He was a very quiet man and didn’t brag,” says Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child that does something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although he invented and invented it, he always gave Paddington himself the responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looks really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got Nad’s call telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said to her, “Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.”
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumped slowly dropped and left her body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn’t wait until I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or scream because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to break up.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now saddened by the loss of her daughter, and the other passengers who had not taken anything of what she had been through, boarded the plane.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Sad women hang cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women, who have lost relatives by suicide, try to keep others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung on a bridge in Wales maps with inspiring messages and phone numbers for advisory offices.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a chef and had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could light up a room.”
However, he announced his job before his death, as he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after his then 11-year-old brother committed suicide.
Davis explained: “I’m always afraid that could have an impact.”
Davis designed the maps to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent: you have to talk about it.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been together for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he felt down or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, he was at the bottom of the house, and when the children unpacked their gifts, he didn't see them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that through it they had to: “It breaks a huge hole in the family.
It's destroying us.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in the air while the FBI begins investigations
“I thought if we could actually get something like this what he was asking for, a timely and limited investigation, then maybe we could get a little bit of consensus,” Flake said on Saturday, fearing that the committee would “break apart” in the political stance.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want FBI investigations?
Their reluctance can only be attributed to timing.
The November 6 midterm elections are only five weeks away, and if the Republicans were to cut badly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush arrested the phone caller to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide on equality of votes, and to confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean Overlords ‘sinked’ under Kim
The number of North Korean surfers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, which relies on data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, stated that last year 1,127 surfers were registered, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher prices of human smugglers as key factors.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean racers will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the surfers more illegal immigrants than refugees, and often returns them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in a state of war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang to talk about the denuclearization negotiations.
This came as a result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of sanctions for lack of progress.
“Without being able to trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm unilaterally first,” Mir Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is not fit for the Supreme Court’s office
Minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was characteristically unsuitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t deny the impression that a woman who acted like this would have been called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh demented emotionally all the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he almost screamed and stood in tears just before he spoke of his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the allegations against him a “gross and coordinated calling murder” organized by liberals who were angry over Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s statement proves that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court as it shows that he is prejudiced against Democrats.
“I believe that with these statements and the way in which he treated the Clintons and the Democrats, he has declared himself inappropriate,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to dismiss Kavanaugh from office, if he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say so much: if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, but also for his current position of judge,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi further said that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion mainstream decision Roe v. Wade, as he is regarded as a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh asked whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need a hysterical, preconceived person who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘Oh, that’s not wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
Women need to use it as a weapon.
It’s a sincere hate speech, months and years of overwhelming anger and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, and you?”
She continued, “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said she was also crying when she got angry but developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts crying, tell the person she spoke to, “You may think I’m sad because I’m.
I'm angry."
And then just keep talking.
I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, in part because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is a former job, in a man-dominated office, where one day I cried because of an indescribable anger and was dragged into a staircase by an older woman, a undercooled manager, whom I was always a little scared about.
“Never let her see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re stinker.
They think you’re sad and will be happy with themselves because they believe you’ve gone to the substance.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a ship called Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and subsequently withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential nomination himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’.
As the election campaign had already progressed, she was behind the fundraising and vowed not to run if she did not get <0x24>2 million together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated <0x24>1,000 to men, only supported her campaign with <0x24>250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
In the speech in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so out of her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made the acquisition of funds and the direct addressing of the voters so difficult instead of the delegates, as well as the anger over the sexism she stood so near.
“You could have assumed I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I still remember wondering what they would probably write on my gravestone.
"She was crying?"
Why Beijing could benefit from trade war between the U.S. and China
The opening oils of the trade war between the United States and China were overwhelming. Although the battle is not over yet, Beijing could benefit from a digging between the countries in the long run, my experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year when he occupy major Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminum, with criminal duties.
The most significant escalation this week took place with new penal duties on goods worth <0x24>200 billion, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China to the United States.
Every time, Beijing hit back in the same way and recently raised penalties of between five and ten percent on US goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has sworn to respond to any US action and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will soon collapse.
Moving Washington to incline would mean surrendering, but a public incline toward the United States would be far too tasty for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Yet my experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who was able to work at the American Center for Security in New Asia.
Syria is ‘ready’ for return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by the seven-year war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists to bring back normality.
All the conditions have now been laid for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and bases of life.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomed aid in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that there would be no conditions-related assistance from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over much of the tournament, drowned his run on the 16th track (Par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all of his rounds and became one of 4 players who scored 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world’s best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England’s Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I’m so happy to win the cup back.
It’s about the team and I’m happy to have made a contribution,” said emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He goes on to beat his countryman John Rahm, who won the singles against American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1.
“I’m so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods that I’ve been chasing on TV since I was a kid,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team had trouble finding the Fairways over the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have made high-profile performances throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: “I’m proud of the guys they’ve fought.
There was a time this morning when we had put Europe under pressure.
We didn't make any of it.
Hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players made a good performance.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated.”
