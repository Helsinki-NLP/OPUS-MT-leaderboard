I would like to advise you, as a nurse, that you avoid making mistakes.
I had forgotten to put my passport in my pocket.
As we have always said, we do not have to be late.
I’ve always been an eyewitness.
I spend Christmas with my family all the time.
I'm the head.
I am the chairman of the committee.
I’m talking to you.
I'm unemployed.
I'm curious.
I was eaten.
I live in Wolgograd.
I have seen this from a different perspective.
Don't worry, Emma.
I'm getting married.
I'm not Gary.
I'm not rich, Gary.
Excuse me.
I am convinced that he is a righteous man.
Before I went there, I was very disappointed.
I was patient, but now I have to go home.
I am your brother-in-law.
Tom and Mary have now come to our home.
I asked the door a few questions.
I have confidence in you that we care for you.
I cooked tomato browni.
I am confident that you will not be able to see the picture.
I bought it with a 10% discount.
I bought the TVs from that store.
I've smashed one of your hands.
I woke up from Tommy’s cell phone.
I did this in a week.
I don't know. I remember the kid.
I can say.
I can answer that question.
I can't answer the phone now.
I can’t refine your plan.
I can be sure that Tom didn’t look after Mary.
But you can't come here.
I can't come in at this time.
You can't come here tonight.
I was able to communicate with Tom just as I did before.
I couldn’t keep my eyes on what you’ve done.
I can't make it tonight.
I don't have time to read.
I don’t even remember where I was selling it.
I don't know.
I was tired and tired.
I can’t speak Berber, and I can’t speak Emma one day.
I can't take your money.
I can't take your money.
Tom was eager to say the same thing.
She is from a small town in Kabila, Algeria.
I had a hard time getting married.
I could help you.
I didn’t know what was wrong in my life.
If you didn't help me, I wouldn't do it.
I decided to be in the locker room.
I decided to take the other side against him.
I did it because I did everything else.
I didn’t tell Tom.
A lot of Almadym.
Lots of almonds.
I don't need anything
I didn't even know we had experience.
I didn’t have a good day to go to bed last night.
I didn't have enough time to do all the work I had to do.
I didn't kill my wife.
I didn’t know what your dog was holding.
I didn’t know you were such a good cook.
I didn’t know Tom was going to die.
When they told me that Tom and Mary weren’t going to help me, I didn’t know what to do.
I didn’t know why my car hadn’t started running.
I didn't know you were romantic.
I didn't want to answer Tom's questions.
I didn’t realize that Tom and Mary wanted me to do that.
I didn’t realize Tom was busy.
I never showed Toma anything.
I'm not going to sleep
I didn’t think it would be easy to do that.
I knew that there was a reason why we needed to do so.
I don't think it's possible to see Tom's performance.
I didn’t think Tom was telling you how to do that.
I didn’t think Tom was telling you how to do that.
I want to go there with you.
I'd like to invite you to follow up on your work.
I wanted to spend time on a tour and camping trip in my new home.
I want to swim in this sea
It would be nice if I had to get up early with you.
I do not advise them to buy this car.

Tom had no idea who he was planning to go to a nursing home with.
I know why Tom and Mary are so upset.
I know the reasons for your inability to do so.
I don't look at all of them.
I'm going to go out of my way, haha.
I'm going to take this bite.
I can’t be corrected in many ways.
I'll see you a little bit better than my daughter
I don’t remember how I came home that night.
This gun does not mean that anyone else wants to do this.
I'm the home of success
I can't believe they're successful.
It's a mistake for you.
I thought that was the right thing to do.
I don’t think that Tom knows what he wants to buy for his father’s money.
Imagine that Tom will be in Australia next week.
Tom is doing this today, and I think he is doing it.
You may feel that you need to tell Tom that you are willing to do so.
It is not surprising that Tom did this for the first time.
I would say that this is not the only way to do so.
I don't think you should talk to Tom and Mary.
Tom and Mary, who had seen one of these before, asked me: “How can I do this?”
Imagine that Tom and Mary knew what you were doing.
Tom can help you, and he can help you.
Tom didn’t think he knew anyone who could do that.
It is not surprising that Tom knew someone who could do so.
However, he does not think that he knows the names of all.
I think Tom's response was wrong.
We are saddened by the results.
I understand why Tom didn't want us to be there.
I'm using words like that.
I want him to hear it.
I don’t want to.
He does not want to be thrown out of prison.
I'm going to be like him.
I don’t want to eat.
I don’t want to be like him.
I do not want to go to church.
I don’t want to listen to a lie.
I wanted to live in Australia for more than a year.
I'm going to do something else.
I've never had anything to do with it.
I didn’t want to speak French.
I want to be here tonight.
I'm going to wake up these kids.
I'm going to be successful this time.
I can't believe it's a success.
I think we'll be successful this time.
I'm sure they're going to be skeptical.
I'm sure we'll prove it, and we're in doubt.
I doubt Tom’s willingness to serve well, and I doubt the truth.
It's the wine of Alain.
I didn't want to accept it.
I have a lot of desire for him.
I have a lot of desire for her.
I long for a society that is divided in a just state of prosperity
I feel that I am wrong, which is why I have so many friends on Facebook.
I went to a movie theater.
I felt a fever in my throat.
If he doesn’t write, I’ll never write to him.
Who's going to tell him if I don't?
When it is early in the morning, there is no need to worry.
Tom was able to go to school.
I was reminded of what I was doing.
Today, I'm reminded of Shakespeare.
I had forgotten that I was going to eat anything.
You forgot to talk to Tom.
I found the sea.
Even if you want to be superior, you should start with a positive attitude.
If we were there, we'd be together.
Even if you do not have a goal in your life, you are just waiting to die.
If you don’t have enough money, take it easy.
If you don't drink alcohol, you're going to die.
If you can explain it, Tom must understand it.
If you have a question with Tom and Mera, ask yourself a question.
Regardless of what you do, you will be able to reach out to him if you really want him to do so.
If you’re a good writer, you’ll need to impress your writing.
I'm the closest one.
To help her, I gave her three textbooks.
I felt like I was going to get married, and I felt like I was going to die.
I went to school at eight o’clock.
I go to school every day.
I had a good time with Tomoko.
The money was stolen from my loss.
In the field, I was disfellowshipped.
I didn’t know you met Tom.
When I was on a trip, I moved to a very interesting location.
I'm going to burn them.
I had to tell the truth.
I've had a lot of trouble opening the door.
I don’t feel discouraged.
I have a problem.
I have a desire.
I have a lot of problems.
I have a feeling of Tom.
I've been on the bus for five hours.
I used to climb Mount Fuji.
I have a vineyard.
Before that, I met him.
I know I've got a bar.
I don't think of anything.
I didn't actually say "no" like you.
I didn't say Tom.
I haven’t heard anything since July.
I haven't seen him since.
I didn’t talk to Tom about my financial issues, but I did.
I have a lot of questions.
I have something in my eye.
I've been blocked.
My homework is very busy.
I have two hands and ten fingers.
I don't have a cat
I heard that one of the men was arrested.
I heard that someone kept my name.
I heard that Tom was playing the script.
I knew that Tom was on the top of the hills.
It is our hope that all of us will be with us.
I hope that this will be the end of the world.
I'm hoping that Mary will continue to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
I hope that Tom and Mary’s heart will not be broken.
I hope that Tom will not be able to help.
It’s not like Tom was hoping.
I'm hoping Tom will know who's going to get him.
I hope to see you again in October, and I hope to see you again.
I hope that we will get the right result.
I'm hoping you won't be able to see the future
I hope that you will come back to me again.
I bought a house.
I've been trying to get a new one for a long time.
I just bought a new jacket for myself.
I can’t help but draw the seed.
I am trying to see that you are not merely paying attention or that you are not paying attention.
I just want to know what really happened.
I knew that it was so.
I knew that Tom had a lot of money.
I knew Tom's fear.
I knew that Tom didn’t know how to do that.
I knew that you had passed your test of French language.
