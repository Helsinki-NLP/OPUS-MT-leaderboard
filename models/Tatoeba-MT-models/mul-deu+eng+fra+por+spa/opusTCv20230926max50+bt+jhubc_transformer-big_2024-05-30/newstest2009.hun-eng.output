The Prague Stock Exchange has been minuscule at the end of the trade
The Prague Stock Exchange has corrected its losses after the morning's hurricane.
Transactions with the shares of the Czech Energy Enterprise (<0xC4><0x8C>EZ) accounted for almost half of the usual daily trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued to fall on Monday from the start of Tuesday’s trade, when it fell almost six percent.
This time, the decline in Wall Street shares is behind the decline.
We also see the market reaction to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the stabilization plan for the financial sector there.
Recession of shares in Asia
The Asian stock market experienced a dramatic decline on Tuesday, although the indicators over the course of the day cancelled some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock index depreciated nearly four percent during the course of trading, but later wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors Chinese stocks, fell 3.8 percent, while the markets closed in Shanghai.
Sydney's stocks lost more than five percent, but ultimately the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange fell 3.6 per cent according to its index.
“The timing of the U.S. bailout is uncertain and affects the world’s financial markets,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, decides its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, the interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should immediately resume negotiations and accept a proposal to support the financial system.
In other words, other countries are also threatening to experience the consequences of this.
The Bloodbath of American Shares
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, to which <0x24>700 billion (almost <0x24>12 billion) should have been spent.
Legislators thus ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
Bush said the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks underwent a blood bath, and the leading stock indexes recorded the biggest drop in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell almost seven percent, the last time it experienced a similar drop in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal was not accepted in the House, the index began to drop.
Congress Retreats: U.S. Government to Pump <0x24>700 Billion in Banks
The top leaders of the U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush's government have agreed in a broader form of agreement and financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
This will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have reached a breakthrough in negotiations on the approval of the emergency plan in the form of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system in the amount of <0x24>700 billion (approximately <0x24>12 billion).
But there's no victory yet.
In fact, Congress must complete some of the details of the agreement before they can make the final form of the law and their vote public.
The draft financial system support will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
This was reported by the Reuters news agency on Sunday by Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Organizations Committee.
According to Senate sources, the bill is likely to be voted on Wednesday.
According to economists, there should be a notification that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important driver of the recovery of the money markets.
Due to the complexity of the mechanisms, however, there is subsequently a "production".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We took a big step.
We have resolved our divergent views as to what the form of the package for stabilizing the market should be like,” Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
He said the final vote could be held on Sunday.
Legislators met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Saturday night to give a final form of government fund.
This should purchase inseparable mortgage assets from financial companies, which will cause financial firms to suffer serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
"We are close to a final agreement on a plan that will work and that must be effective in the market at the same time.
The improvement plan still needs to be undertaken, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
Signs of Asian Trade <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada said lawmakers are striving to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before they start trading on the Asian money markets, where due to the time zone, Congress’s decision could be the first to influence Monday’s trading.
At the moment, however, it is unclear whether the two chambers of the U.S. Congress are voting on the law, as is the case, whether or not the trial could be delayed at the last minute due to any problem.
Legislators hope that the law will be passed in the coming days.
However, the law is still undergoing many changes.
The total amount intended to support the system shall be divided into two parts.
At the request of President George Bush, the first <0x24>350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, Congress could block the release of the remaining amount, which was set at an additional <0x24>100 billion and later at <0x24>350 billion if it feels like the program is not performing its function.
Bush assessed progress in the negotiations.
Although the President may revoke this decision, the Congress may override the veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained, which was to acquire material assets for the acquisition of poorly valued mortgage securities, as hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to cancel their mortgage loans.
"We've done everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
President Bush was also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Bush's spokesman, Tony Fratto, said the president was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the bilateral efforts made to stabilize our money markets and defend our economy".
Restriction of end-of-bus reliefs
Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said that the legislators have agreed on the responsibility for the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of discounts, and the timing of financing.
The new law also restricts the so-called bus termination allowances of the directors involved in the programme and sets up a committee to supervise the fund.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have been working very hard on this and we have made great progress towards a deal that will work and that will be useful to all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts on the assistance provided to homeowners who have problems with the cancellation.
The government should create new cancellation details for the bonds it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly cancellation details of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Spiritual Assistance
The proposed draft is a good idea, according to David Marek, head of the Patria Finance, but implementation will be very difficult.
“All this is because it is impossible to know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government divide the losses between each other," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
According to Marek, it is not so important that the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week.
“It’s so much more important that Congress decides this week to support the plan, and as soon as possible, to bless it.
"The spiritual importance of an agreement on whether the plan will be approved is the most important thing at the moment," Marek said.
Pair in a ribbon: MP3 players vs. mobiles.
We help you how to choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, you can’t call with any MP3 player.
This makes it clear that it is better to only buy a phone.
However, there are many reasons to get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the needs of the future owner.
It’s probably hard to get a high-quality, expensive record player at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc record.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on records, but there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if the shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues bachelor records, then you’re probably dreaming of such a record player.
This is similar to travel, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For some, it may be unacceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan probably finds it hard to accept a 20-krone market headphone.
There are two extremes between which everyone has enough space.
The choice is wide.
The lifespan of the elements is also important
Some high-quality music players are capable of much more than simply playing music, but also something that most mobile phones don’t even accidentally do.
None of today’s devices are as versatile as a phone.
In addition to the primary features, phone calls and texting, you can also play music and video, you can record both, you have a better and worse camera, and you can even navigate.
And if we take into account smartphones and communicators, there will also be a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle, as no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph.
Multifunctional mobile phones also have disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the more the display sends to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy regulators.
Few mobile devices are able to play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
With cheap mobiles, therefore, count on the fact that they won’t play for you for a few hours.
In addition, if you’re still on the phone here and there, get even one charger at your workplace for safety reasons – this also applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players won’t have this problem, even the worst ones can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation with a single upload.
The next problem arises when uploading music to your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices have a universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without any special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers struggle with the miniature memory cards used in mobile phones without an adapter.
Players with some exceptions (iPods) do not need any special software.
Just charge the device with music from the computer via USB. <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The majority of mobile phones and players already create their own music library based on the performer's name, the album, the genre, or, for example, the user's assessment.
Some devices only represent a firmware similar to Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Players are easier to handle, mobile phones know more
When selecting a specific equipment, first of all, ask about the life of the battery, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output, and, of course, the convenience of handling.
If your music serves primarily as a background and only listens for a short period of time a day, for example, on the power station, any MP3 player will suit you.
You can actually do this on any mobile phone.
You don’t have to pay special attention to what music formats your mobile or player knows.
Everybody is dealing with MP3, and most of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
MP3 is one of the most popular, and in addition to that, the vast majority of devices also deal with music in WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and the iPod) is less common.
Better mobiles also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Simply visit the appropriate pages of the provider (or other provider) via the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service can in itself be a compelling argument for the purchase of music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of service providers is vague and usually limited to one-year radio stations.
The prices are not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of selling method of music (whether on GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music market in the future.
Most people keep their mobile phones with them all the time.
Whenever you like to listen to something, your mobile phone rings in your pocket while your forgotten MP3 player is at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry the headphones or at least the speakers.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker, which has almost every mobile, but only a few MP3 players.
For many, the biggest benefit of music mobile phones is likely to be the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 crowns.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can already get a fair walkman.
In most cases, however, you are limited by the lack of output of the traditional headphones.
The best and most technically equipped phones can cost up to fifteen thousand crowns with the traditional 3.5 mm diameter of the headphones.
At the same time, the advantage of the players is, besides the simple handling.
The easiest - not necessarily the most expensive - players (see our selection) are really being handled by everyone.
Minimum function, the previous standard cassette with magnet or gramophone handling is obvious.
There is no threat of collapse in the form of accidentally switched on mobile internet, nor in the case of a huge account for data transfer.
What kind of device to choose
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have openings for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
You can also purchase the right card for up to two thousand crowns.
But be careful about it.
Basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can do what with up to 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and even want to buy cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Irivert.
Based on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not need to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you’re among the most demanding students, choose special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices also have a separate MP3 controller button, the convenience of handling approaches the MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, the most beautiful in the industry, has the same user interface for Walkman series mobiles as the separately sold MP3 players.
MP3 players of the aforementioned brands can provide the same service in the same price category for up to 4,000 crowns, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Possibly
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our service providers offer virtually the same services as their Western European partners.
Nonetheless, there is something missing here - a virtual service provider forcing classical providers to substantially lower prices.
Maybe it won't be that long.
On the Mobil.cz website, we have often written that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which drew attention to the fact that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in the other EU countries.
After the European Commission’s last move to regulate roaming fees, there may be a conflicting situation – text messages sent from abroad to some of the Czech mobile providers will be cheaper than domestic ones.
How is it possible that the prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking in the competition that really wants to get into the fight.
This may sound contradictory, because we have three mobile networks and our penetration is high above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile providers would like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, the president of the Czech Telecommunications Office, has often agreed with this, who has previously stated on several occasions that there is no place for a new service provider in the Czech Republic.
Perhaps it’s true that a classic service provider with its own network probably doesn’t have too many chances (although it’s probably already hard to find a frequency).
However, there is another option - the virtual service provider.
The move of virtual service providers to the mobile market brought a significant price drop, after which the classical service providers had to react.
Even before the big fish market, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, sounds like mine were heard in the UK.
However, it has been proven that such service providers have a place and can really succeed.
However, for example, we do not have to go too far.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
In less than half a year, this service provider has managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest service provider in the country.
Meanwhile, behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among other things.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the ability to focus on a much narrower target group.
In order to operate efficiently, you need far less customers than a traditional service provider.
It does not incur relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers around the world are thus usually presented as low-cost - offering cheap calls and texting, which are often offset by less service.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers at least 50 percent cheaper text messages than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, a good draw can be a good bet on a target group.
This service provider is specially focused on men.
“Real men choose the Mobilking service provider – who they like, who they can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company, who operates this virtual service provider.
It’s hard to tell if we have an idea similar to that of Poland.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> doubts this: “The Czech market is relatively small in terms of the segmental approach on which the majority of virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory in terms of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic, it is unlikely, say mobile providers
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem too hopeful.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries of our region," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, a spokeswoman for Penta Finance Group, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
In the meantime, he proved that the existing mobile service providers in the Czech Republic were not too familiar with this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything in their power to prevent any potential competition from being created.
For some time now, the GTS Novara Group has not hidden its interest in launching a virtual service provider, which is thus looking to take another step towards making Telefonica O2 a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in providing our customers not only with wired, but also with mobile telecommunications services.
But the sooner, the better.
We have re-negotiated this option with all Czech mobile providers.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl, the group's spokesman.
There may be better times coming.
Unofficial information suggests that the first virtual service provider may be lucky by the end of the year.
His birth, however, is currently surrounded by an impenetrable listening wall.
“At this point, we do not think that a full-fledged virtual service provider would have a place in the Czech market.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very special.
We have not always been invited by a single entity, offering a complex and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, the press department of Telefónica 02, told Mobil.cz.
The special situation of the Czech market is also referred to by the other service providers.
Martina Kemrová, spokeswoman for T-Mobile, adds: “We have not recorded a single viable and bilaterally beneficial business project on which we can rely further.”
He added: “In the T-Mobile network, it is unlikely that any virtual service provider will appear before the end of the year.
“At this moment, there should be a concrete agreement on our table so that we can think about it in such a short time.”
Vodafone is focusing on meeting its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are trained to negotiate with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
From the point of view of our customers, we consider this to be the most rewarding.
Vodafone’s main strategy is to partner in this area to build fast mobile networks.”
Responsible offices - a cord with service providers
The procedure of mobile service providers is easy to understand, and the entry of a new service provider would lead to increased competition, lowering prices and thereby reducing their profits.
So why should we facilitate the entry of such a competition?
When service providers are able to cooperate with something important, they also bear witness to the link around the birth of the U:fon.
The biggest pressure on <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was probably around the birth of T-Mobile’s U:fone.
This is evidenced by the information publicly available on the <0xC4><0x8C>TU website.
But right now U:fon comes as a good reason why we should not allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: "The environment of competition in the mobile market has recently been challenged by the entry of the fourth mobile service provider market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of a new player to the market and its services will support high demands."
However, given the attitude of the mobile service providers, the total lack of interest of the Czech regulatory bodies is quite surprising.
At the same time, it is not just about the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> attitude, which in the Czech Republic unfortunately - unlike the UK and other developed countries - does not have the right to interfere in the economic competition.
Only the Competition Authority has the right to do so.
However, the agency is naturally related to the whole problem.
"The entry of a virtual service provider into the mobile market would only be possible after the contract between a mobile service provider and a virtual service provider is concluded to lease the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential interested parties to traditional service providers was probably not sufficiently interesting," said Kristian Chlupua, the Foreign Relations Department of Economic Competition.
A statement thus made by the representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the office, which should represent the interests of consumers and, besides, take care that no one can live back from the market situation, this is more than strange.
As Kristián Chalupa adds, “In the country where virtual service providers usually operate, we can observe that our market entry has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile phone services.”
However, it is likely that the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS do not include the proper functioning of the market environment and the pressure to lower prices.
In this case, a truly shocking consistency resulting from the reaction of the three mobile service providers.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is almost self-evident.
As with charging stations, the exact same gas prices are certainly just the works of accidental and harsh competition.
"The Office has not discovered any signs of anti-competitive proceedings in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the service providers have a leading position, i.e. they have no relatively greater responsibility for their market facts.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market for virtual service providers are also likely to be lacking in the telecommunications regulator,” said Chalupa.
Presenting the market leader position is one of many points of debate.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, on the basis of which telecommunications is the single market from the point of view of competition.
Of course, there is not a single Czech service provider in a leading position on such a market.
However, some legal experts also offer a different perspective - the creation of a virtual service provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile service provider - relatively logically - has a monopoly on its own network.
So it is necessarily dominant in a certain segment.
But even if we did not accept this argument, <0xC3><0x9A>OHS should have a minimum incentive for three mobile service providers to act in a similar manner.
In the meantime, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the already mentioned GTS Novara company) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in the course of negotiations with all service providers.
The <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS takes his hand off the whole case.
We've met with this in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>’s extension of its competence in the field of economic competition in telecommunications has not been able to be overcome, although this has led to many experts hoping to improve the situation.
Representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS should know this well, but they probably have other interests.
It works when no one is watching.
In the meantime, the operation of some kind of al-virtual service providers remains unnoticed, many of which already operate in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile phone services, but which are only partially public.
It is a multi-level marketing company.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the selected ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts against the service provider as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a special customer, you will receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the terms of trade of all Czech mobile service providers prohibit similar fees.
"If there were any cases that we were talking about, it could be a breach of the terms of the contract that we are dealing with and that could lead to the termination of cooperation with the company," said Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that the news of this kind of activity would not have reached the people responsible for the mobile service providers.
In the case of the three companies mentioned above, it can be about thousands of customers.
At the same time, none of the service providers are protected against such a procedure.
In fact, these companies have a negligible profit from their activities, and in the meantime, unlike real virtual service providers, they are not particularly threatened by their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns of possible problems: “The law allows similar speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that their phone does not have a SIM card in their name, so they cannot have it in full as the general customers of mobile service providers."
But that's what the <0xC4><0x8C>TU should at least be strange.
There is also another question for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile service providers are looking at a similar procedure, why are they preventing the birth of a virtual service provider?
It should be noted that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has a relatively strong right to disclose such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to satisfy the service providers with the explanation that they have not made any such provision and that their terms and conditions prohibit this.
When we won't be the most expensive
As has already been stated several times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has led to a noticeable drop in the price of services.
In virtually all countries where virtual service providers were created, classical service providers have been trying to prevent them from being created more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small, perhaps too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies were involved in these moments, which did not in any way protect the interests of the mobile service providers, but of their customers.
Then, either through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual service provider followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies donate the whole thing to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competencies are good for them in these cases.
But don't give up on the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider really appears with us soon, the Czech mobile market may be in motion again.
If one of the service providers permits the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS can only be difficult to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of additional stakeholders.
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may no longer be more expensive to call.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to four revisions of the new version of the Czech State Anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topola presented the new recordings of the national anthem of Where is my country? on the day of the Czech State.
The hymn was recorded by the musician of the National Theatre, Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female soloists, with vocals or instrumental.
Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The hymn was modified by Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national anthem one of the most beautiful hymns.
He told Czech Radio in the past that he had deliberately selected young representative vocal singers who were expressive and popular to sing the solo variations.
"From the very beginning, I was trying to keep a clear dictation, a good understanding of the lyrics, and a consistent one," he said.
The Czech National Anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary this year.
The song "Where Is My Country?" was first performed at the Rendi Theatre in 1834 in the play "Josef Kajetán Tyl Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka", supplemented by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>krup.
It became popular, and people considered it spontaneously their own.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the state anthem after the Czechoslovakia was founded in 1918.
Even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, the seven state symbols remained one.
What is the “new” anthem?
Prague transport company delivers chip card for the first time on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, he will enter the history of the Prague Transportation Company as the first passenger to have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a line of paper.
The coupon is currently available to around 100,000 people who have an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day and annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time save to their chip card at the information centers and consignments of the Transport Company at the Museum, M<0xC5><0xAF>jtek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>i Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, Kobyká, Andyradá and Rozrov.
Coupons can also be purchased online from yesterday via the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers in the afternoon.
Those who are starting to use the internet can definitely forget the publishing windows of the metro stations, where they had to regularly finish long lines for the tickets.
The coupon can be purchased online and can be used on the Opencard card in one of the thirteen accounts of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers have at their disposal a desk with trained servers that help interested people in online shopping and save their purchased vouchers on their card," said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, a spokesman for the project.
In addition to the libraries, electronic coupons for Opencard will also be saved in some self-serving vending machines equipped in the halls.
What do these machines look like?
Pirosak, the ticket managers are reminded and the passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florence and Vltavská subway stations.
"There are five of them in the city at the moment, but it should be eighty by the end of the year," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
The coupon is checked automatically by the driver instead of the driver
It's easy to manage the automatons that start their operations tomorrow.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be saved on its own.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So on the trains and bus trains around the city from 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the residents of the central Czech railways to travel to the capital.
"On the trains listed in Prague integrated transport, the kalauzes were supplied with card readers, with the help of which they also determine the zone validity of the coupons," explained Filip Drápal of the Prague Public Transport Schedule.
In buses around the city, card readers are embedded at the driver’s wallet.
When boarding, the driver must not only show the chip card, but also place the Opencard at the specified location on the side of the wallet.
This way the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"For example, if the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, it's the easiest to ask the driver for this," Drápal added.
Passengers who travel around the city by bus and will not remember that their coupon is valid when it expires can go back to the self-service automatas that save the coupons on the cards.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the device.
The Sudanese wanted a referendum from the United States.
In 1945, the Sudanese Germans demanded <0xC5><0xA0>umava to join the United States.
This is derived from the letter in the collection of the Scientific Library in the South of the Czech Republic.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States.
It is believed that this wish was addressed to the President of the United States by some groups of Germans summoned in 1945.
This is also revealed by a letter from a private archive that is now being kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of the South of the Czech Republic.
In the letter, the Germans in <0xC4><0x8C>esky krumlov called on the U.S. president not to allow the return of the "S<0xC5><0xAB>mava county" to the Czech Republic, which even Hitler had taken under the Munich Treaty.
"We have interpreted the situation correctly and we really want to be sure in the words that American troops do not come to the German territories in any way as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter reads, "people who live in their hearts."
Since the attachment to Czechoslovakia to the Sudanese Germans allegedly - in addition to the knowledge of the Czech national character - can only give hope to brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and enslavement, the authors of the letter "written by the authors of the letter to the prosecutors and to the prosecutors of the United States".
“We cannot believe that, despite the opinion of four million people, this area would be considered a foreign country for us, which would oppress and upset the minority, and would contribute almost nothing to the Allied victory,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors could not sign was the fear of revenge from the "Czech oppressors".
So if the U.S. president allegedly doubted the opinion of the Germans in Schumacher, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the district of Schumacher on whether residents would like to become part of the U.S. and whether they would want to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem a little naive in addition to the current knowledge of post-war history, some historians say it correctly depicts the expectations of the Sudanese Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to minimize the possibility that they would be expelled from the country, few of them recognized the possibility.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to have some sort of autonomy for the Sudanese.
Again, others were confident that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovic.
During the war, Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as a German in Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
When at the end of the war the British were captured and taken to the Holstein concentration camp, dozens of other Czech Germans moved to teach them Czech.
"They were confident that if they came home, they would be welcome in the Czech language," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war claimed that they were expelled from the country on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
The Emotional Campaign Attacks the Leaders
The most expensive action in Czech history for the safety of roads.
This could also be characterised by the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s cabinet of ministers hopes that this campaign will keep the leaders out of dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The 150 million-plus campaign will be featured on television, radio, movies, the internet, but also on the screen.
You should warn the drivers from driving fast and alcohol.
And you should also remind them to put on their seatbelts before they leave.
First and foremost, young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, above all, professional drivers want to express their conscience.
And what's in the ads?
Emotionally attacking, primarily human stories.
This is evidenced by the "blood" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "don't think" in the order number is written in capital letters.
And there's the word "paid" in the bloodstream.
This must symbolize that a person can pay for a moment’s inattention with his life.
Advertising shops will be “removed” by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns from English-speaking countries, where drastic images of the victims of accidents can be viewed regularly.
It is hoped that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
Advertising spots were created by the Euro RSCG agency.
Push it, Push it to the drivers
"The 'Draw, Drop' system is valid for drivers.
For them, the word ‘stop’ is when they pass the pyro, saving time.
The ‘draw me’ is the risk of punishment or accident.
The driver needs to be reminded of the risk,” says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án, a transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why information campaigns are needed in the press, especially the negative campaign, the psychologist believes.
He believes that the driver's attention is less effective than the warning signs.
"If the danger warning board is fitted, it is likely to melt together with the environment soon and the drivers will not deal with it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehoud Olmer, the president of the interim Israeli government, spoke about the return of virtually all of the occupied territories in 1967, i.e. the West Bank of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
This was said in an interview published on Monday by Jedi Achronot daily.
“We have to deal with the Palestinians, which means almost all of them, if not all of them, will have to be returned,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we must give the Palestinians a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because without them there will be no peace,” he added.
He acknowledged that a possible return would include East Jerusalem as well.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and above all wants tractors and bulldozers not to pass on their feet, as one of my best friends did, must give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to the attack on two cities in July.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution to the Temple Mount, sacred and historic places" in the Old Town.
“Anyone who wants to preserve Israel’s sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It will not work," he stressed.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Mr Olmert also expressed an opinion on the withdrawal of the Israelis from the Golan Heights, which he said was an essential condition for a peace treaty with Syria.
This, however, would require some effort from Damascus as well.
"I do not propose a peace treaty with Syria based solely on the withdrawal from the Golan," he warned.
“The Syrians know what they have to give up to get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Syrian movement); they must give up the regular support that Hamas (Syrian movement), al-Qaeda and Jihad (Holy War) have provided for terrorism."
After an accident: Is it illegal to have passenger escorts on buses?
The law does not recognize them, you should not walk on a long-distance bus
With regard to the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near Padova, Italy, the question arose as to whether passengers and escorts could travel on the bus while traveling.
“If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the passenger escort’s activity is contrary to the law on transport activities,” said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transportation.
Last week, the death of a twenty-two-year-old passenger was probably caused by a truck driver crossing the bus.
The girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver at the least safe place on the bus, although two more seats were reserved for her.
The bus may crash, or suddenly brake, even when the passenger serves a coffee or offers a newspaper.
It does not matter if the bus has a parking lot according to the driving license.
If there is no approval on the bus, passengers must sit.
The Student Agency’s long-distance buses have no stops, which was confirmed by Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, the company’s director, for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“We tried to find a solution with this ministry, and initially passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this has been withdrawn and we have come to the conclusion that passengers can go to the toilet along the way if they have their own seat," he said.
The Law Doesn't Know the Passenger
"There is no clear legal norm for the role of passenger escort - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no law prohibits the provision of the services to the carrier.
The Road Traffic Act only recognizes the concept of a driver; it does not define his rights and obligations," added a spokeswoman for Hanzelka.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, Director of the Department of Road Vehicle Operations, believes that the law is handling the problem properly.
"It depends on whether the bus has a parking space in its license.
And it's over," he says.
Buses can be urban according to their distinctiveness, where there are parking spaces and are limited to the maximum speed, as well as parking spaces between the cities and at permitted speeds, as well as distances without parking spaces and with permitted maximum speeds.
Like on a plane, says the expert
Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín, the BESIP traffic safety expert, does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of passengers on board the bus.
"With the continuous progress, there are not many threats, the situation can be compared to the service on the plane.
There is no certainty about when there is turbulence and the airliner can get his head in."
"But if the bus suddenly brakes, of course, the laws of physics are valid.
Same as in city buses or trams.
The safety of passengers must be solved by the carrier with internal rules," he says and also believes that the problem has not been solved in terms of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to terminate services
As the only bus carrier, the Student Agency offers passenger escort services.
He employs two hundred passenger escorts.
Even after the accident, the director considers their profession to be risky.
"However, as I have the impression that the occupation of passenger escorts is risky, I will stop.
Guests can get coffee and newspapers upon boarding.
That would also be cost savings,” he said.
Alexej Litvin, director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of flights compared to the Student Agency, argued for safety reasons in his vehicles.
"We're not comrades, we've been resisting this from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it ends with some kind of deadly injury,” he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz just over a year ago.
An unbelievable tragedy happened.
A young passenger from Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who worked for the company for two years, died on a scheduled flight in Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably curved out of the stopping line without using a sign of direction and stopped the bus route.
The driver of the bus suddenly tried to avoid the maneuver, but the right front of the bus crashed.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura rejects the fact that two reserved seats were also sold for the passengers’ rest.
"These seats can't be booked on long-distance flights, they're blocked."
The company wants to rob the driver of the truck.
With the compensation of the girl’s family, the agency does not expect the court’s verdict, but also expects financial compensation from the offender.
Amendment of law?
In the distant future
To clarify the movement of passengers on board the bus could mean the amendment of the law, which has been working on for more than a year by a team of thirty-member experts from the Ministry of Transport.
"The team, however, did not get any specific results.
Buses are not that much, rather the point system deals with the maximum speed allowed on the highway and mobile usage during driving,” says Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín expert.
"The Ministry of Transportation does not consider the activities of passenger escorts to be of any kind that would fundamentally jeopardize the safety of passengers," said Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transportation, who said that checking the safety of buses is within the scope of the police and labor offices.
Düsseldorf hopes go to Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB’s board of directors to the bank’s employees is not narrowed down in the big words.
The Düsseldorf financial institution’s units and the Frankfurt Deka-Bank merger could create “the central capital market organisation of the savings fund group,” the letter said.
WestLB would introduce a permanently profitable "competence block" into such a business.
Such a link could give a decisive boost to further mergers in the regional banking sector.
This is a reading of when a board of directors wants to prove their ability to act in difficult times.
The uncertain WestLB bank is still under a lot of pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also on the part of the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Board, which recently informed the North Rhine-Westphalia government that it is restricting the deadline for finding a lasting solution.
For savings bank customers, however, Deka-Bank and WestLB have long been renowned for their investment bases, and this kind of relationship - from the Frankfurt side as well.
Franz Waas, the head of Deka-Bank, was aware at the end of August, when the semi-annual figures were announced, that the bank on Mainzer Landstraße and a regional bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, did not understand the meaning of the merger.
Nevertheless, the Deka Board of Directors, which comprises one half of the provincial banks and the other half of the savings fund associations, commissioned the Board of Directors to continue negotiations with WestLB on joint business activities.
In the course of this, the capital market business or certain parts of it may be discussed.
However, the negotiations, according to financial circles, have only just begun.
With 3000 employees, the name Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial sector, does not appear for the first time in connection with the consolidation of the savings banking sector.
In 2003, it appeared that Deka-Bank merged with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba for a moment.
However, none of these three alliances became anything.
The plans were barely made public, and the provincial government in Hesse spoke against the interest of Helaba.
After that, the other two banks did not find each other.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz is located in Baden-Württemberg, Stuttgart.
However, the idea of the relationship between Deka-Bank and provincial banks has been revived over and over again.
However, lately Günther Merl, the chairman of the board of directors of Helaba, opposed the plans for mergers with the bank.
In spite of this, it is important to recognise the need for the approach of various banks in the public sector.
Now, after the Bavaria provincial elections, the first link between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, potential partners may gradually decline from time to time.
In southern Germany, it could only be a younger business partner, although the financial crisis has so far been significantly more severe than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 85% stake in Helaba, was excluded from the merger with WestLB at the beginning of the year.
The NordLB is on the right.
However, such geostrategic considerations represent only one side of the currency.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank fit together.
In June, Merl said that the German Securities and Fat Association had not yet given an answer to the decisive question of what business model to ensure the future of regional banks.
Eventually, WestLB could be broken down, which, of course, they do not want there.
Thus, the letter from the board of directors there also indicates that they are definitely striving for a "complete solution".
How this is compatible with the merger of individual units with Deka-Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian Weekend"
It was the first time, and Luca was the third or fourth time.
Now, however, Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything is completely different, says Luca.
Behind them is a strong bearded man with a five-letter beard by the Kaiser brand, proving to about 200 people who are traveling to the Oktoberfest how deep sounds he can get out of his throat.
Elena shaves Luca's face first, then kisses her.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, four buses depart from the bus station near Puerta Nuova station at 23.45 to the destination "destinazione Monaco, festa della berra", arriving at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly for Italians, but only Brazilians travel in the fourth.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans were already singing next to their flag, starting the celebration at night.
And so loud that it’s not for the Italians,” says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears a long, fine-grained coat and a wide, silver stripe of glasses.
He has been travelling to the Oktoberfest for five years and has only organized three trips this year.
At night, during the day at the Oktoberfest, home at 10:30 p.m.
The accommodation would only be an unnecessary expense, says Marco.
The trip will cost 75 euros, including a welcome Kaiser beer cooked in accordance with the Bavarian brewery law, accident insurance and German-language tour - Marco took a German course in Frankfurt.
And they're already taking the buses into the night on the motorway in the direction of "Brennero".
No beer, no beer.
The bus shuts down, the passengers are asleep.
All right, that's it. They're gonna need their strength.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, where many Italian buses take a short break on the 8th motorway in front of Munich.
When Marco’s group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese as planned, there are almost 50 other buses coming from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final briefing, explaining the war plan.
First of all, take the yellow hat off.
On the left side of this fracture you can read the inscription "Oktoberfest" written in letters, next to it the internet address of Marco's travel office: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, “When the doors of the brewery open, run,” says Marco in the morning.
"Run!" Running and occupancy of the seats at the back of the tent.
"Not forward, for we will rest, and not all the yellow hats will sit on the same benches, but let us scatter in the tent."
The one-liter crucible will cost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.25, says Marco.
And don't forget about the wine.
"Show the security guards that you're doing well.
As you leave the seats, they occupy them.”
Third: "Tonight at 9:30, come back here again." Do you understand?
And now it's heading to Wiesn.
Along the way, one of the men ties yellow hats to the trees, to the boards, and even to the election poster of one of the great Bavarian people.
We need to prepare for the withdrawal.
This is the second weekend of the Oktoberfest, which is known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no accurate figures; 50,000 people are talking about crossing the Alps in the beer fields, and about ten percent of all weekend visitors are said to come from Italy.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tyrolean police, with Italian volunteers assisting the Bavarian Red Cross, which in its national statistics, with about 200 medical treatments, the Italians occupy the first place, ahead of the Austrians (about 60 degrees) and the British (about 80 degrees).
Among the Italians, the Hofbräu brewery was particularly popular.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate lenders
The German banking system is relatively stable, said Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück last week.
Fortunately, the politician used the word "relatively" and added to his statement that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because it happened this weekend, too.
The Munich-listed property funder Hypo Real Estate (HRE) has received a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to defend itself against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that loan subsidies would be fired at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate is only required to pay interest after the portion used.
The money comes in part from private banks and in part from public banks.
In the background are the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
State-funded Deffa, according to a newspaper, lent money to long-term projects and refinanced itself for a very short period of time - which is no longer possible due to distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve decreased by 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million and its equity ratio decreased moderately from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Net revenues from current revenues and monetary transactions have declined to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, from credits to claims and fixed securities, as well as from the repayment of the reserves for credit analyses to EUR 70 million in excess of EUR 5 million.
Only higher revenues resulting from the reimbursement of the subsequent accounting costs of the conversion of the former Deffa Group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the Customs Order and the transactions made to companies belonging to the consortium had a turnover of 16%.
The former state financer speculated about corporate real estate loans after privatisation in 1990, which were later segregated by Aeral Bank.
Since classical public funding was scarce, Deffa was more heavily involved in infrastructure projects, as well as in joint projects of private investors and the state (private-public-partnership, PPP) and expanded its activities internationally.
For the value of subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate now needs to make descriptions that have a "substantial impact" on the performance of the group - it has been reported quite generally.
Actually, there was no payment of dividends.
The dividend was reduced to a third in 2007.
Since the acquisition of Deffa, Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure financer.
Compared to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on the interbank market refinancing, as it does not have any customer loans.
With the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, lending between the banks was out of date as the banks kept their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs some short-term assets each year to refinance a part of Depfa’s loan portfolio – around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion.
According to a statement by Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing demand is covered for the loan-inspected period, and the company is protected "from the influence of the currently largely malfunctioning international financial markets."
According to other sources, because of the money, refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
In contrast, Georg Funke, the chairman of HRE’s board of directors, said that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to take advantage of the money markets for as long as possible.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority (BaFin) see the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate group now secured.
This gives hope to the bank’s shareholders and creditors.
But due to the dynamics and inevitability of the crisis, they cannot be certain.
Nor is it conceivable that funding should not be fully mobilised.
But the opposite of this cannot be excluded.
Since the bank was still on the brink of bankruptcy on Saturday night, even its temporary bailout could not calm the fate.
The share price fell by 75% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 3.30.
On the other hand, bond rates are fairly well maintained.
While the debts listed in the first place barely change, the rates of back-ordered bonds declined significantly.
The crisis affects the former subsidiary, Württemberg Hypo, in particular and in an accessible way, runtimes beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds were previously seen as a speculative investment alternative, their resilience must now be seen as dependent on the stability of the international financial system by the end of the banking crisis and by the fact that the financial institution has almost taken over the Deffa.
As long as banknotes, governments and less endangered business banks are ready to support the system, the deadline for cancellation of flights can be set.
Or what happens is that at the moment almost no one dares to hope that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports relating to partial nationalisation, the boundary probability of certainty is now merely a legitimate hope.
For long-term lenders, it can cause sleepless nights to decide whether to opt out of their investment.
Short-term investors, however, can use the sale to form a reserve for taxes to be paid after the exchange rates of the following years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is scheduled to perform at Tachibana High School on her first day of school, the girls begin to whisper: The German girl is totally "cava"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the manga - she tells about Japan in the new exchange blog.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I'm so excited.
I was already inflamed on my way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, towards Kavaszaki, and I travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find my way alone, fortunately I wasn’t mistaken.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students start snoring from eight o’clock until 8 o’clock begins a short conversation with the teacher, the “home room”.
But before I started teaching, it was time for me to show up.
And I'm not the type of person who likes to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I hadn’t gotten my school uniform yet, I wore an old sweater from my housewife, a blouse, a blue knee jersey and a black leather shoe.
So I stood in this dress in front of your cathedral and tried to say everything correctly: "Sajonara, vo ne Sylvana..." - His name is Sylvana, I came from Germany, and in a week it will be my birthday.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had started learning the language two years ago.
All the 31 girls were sucking, whispering, and whispering, and I kept hearing the word "cavian."
I've known this from my manga.
This belongs to the basics of Japanese girls, and it means "sweet, sweetie."
Then I quickly pushed to my place.
The girl sitting next to me smiled broadly, and it was an honor to have been placed next to the exchange room.
The rest of the clock was quite quiet, but when the bell sounded, they were regularly knocked.
Everyone spoke and laughed together, and they drilled holes in my abdomen with their questions - and it is quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone packed up his inbox.
My host also prepared for me such a lunch - it's completely different from the boring German tenor's sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, small peanut butter, salad made from peanuts and algae, fruit and a kind of tofu-packed meat.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
The food looks strange and has a completely new taste.
Actually, everything's really delicious.
Well, maybe, except for the salt syrup, brrrrr!
In Japanese schools, the breakfast is not just lunch.
It happens that a girl presents a handmade concrete to a boy, which he especially artistically puts together - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during the lunch break.
I read about this in my manga comics.
I'm curious to see if I can watch this here.
"Why exactly Japan?" my girlfriends asked, when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
'Cause you're just charming.'
I’ve been reading my favorite manga for years.
And to better understand the comic books and the culture described in them, I started learning Japanese sometime.
It was clear to me that I would have to travel here someday.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and habits.
And these are in high esteem here.
Japan, on the one hand, is the country of the latest techniques and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything was so well organized, I never felt lost, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats also have emotion.
He runs away in case of a rat or a mole danger. Does that mean he's afraid?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals also have emotions.
But how can we determine whether they feel the same way when they behave like us?
In the online journal "Edge" famous scientists have been publishing their articles for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE provides a series of answers to the question "What do you think is real without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove it so far. It is true that we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is the same.
However, as we examine other species, and complicate the questions of perception or consciousness in general, we come to a difficult terrain, as the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he makes himself a dead man, flees or attacks.
Humans behave in a similar way, from which some researchers result in comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to convey our own subjective experiences to the animals.
On the one hand, the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always contain the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and implementation/control functions).
This wide area is more advanced in humans than in other main characters, and it seems to be completely missing from other living beings.
At least on the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, for example, knowing who we are, or in the case of planning and decision-making, it can be reasonably assumed that man is different even from the other main features.
Another dramatic feature lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since a significant part of the human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
However, even if it does not depend on the language of consciousness, the language would certainly affect, so animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness is like for other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and special hardware cannot be analyzed on the basis of our own experiences, then its research poses serious problems.
Most of my comments are about the content of conscious learning, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be more accessible to science.
It could be examined irrespective of the conscious processes of animals, and this is precisely what happens in the case of short-term experiments on the memory of main mammals, especially in the case of visualization.
However, in this assumption also examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely on the neural connections of consciousness rather than on causal mechanisms: both may or may not be the same.
Interestingly, this assumption also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the creation of visualization.
What is the result of these emotions?
This leads me back to the fact that an emotional system, like your fear, is activated in the brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we call “fear” is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defensive system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies the working memory.
Thus, when examined, emotions are closely related to the areas of the cervical cortex that are characteristic of the main organs and especially of the human.
In addition to the linguistic sign, perception is subdivided into subtle degrees, because with the help of words and linguistics, we are able to distinguish and categorize your states, that we describe them to others besides ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio is of the opinion that emotions originate from simpler activities in the areas of the brain and the brain brain detachment, as does Jaak Pankseep, who, however, prefers to focus on brain detachment.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can easily play a role in the overall emotion of species.
I can't deny this in theory, but I think it's unproven.
Pankseep believes that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to be felt in both cases: How can we check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave the same way?
A squirrel escapes in case of danger, does he feel fear?
In my opinion, just such behavior is not yet a proof of the same experience.
While neural comparison helps further: rats and humans are similar to brainstorms, but rats do not have brains.
But is the brainwash responsible for the emotions?
And even if this could be proven for humans, how can we prove this in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even rats (who knows?) have feelings.
However, I don't know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are supposedly fundamentally different from their own (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I study the emotional behavior of rats rather than the emotional emotions.
In any case, there is progress in this area at the neural level, if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Just as I do not study the language and consciousness of rats, so do I do not study the emotions, because I do not know if they exist.
This may seem like a short-sighted attitude to others, but I'm moving forward rather than constantly colliding with walls.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, UEFA President: A Time of Mercy for Poland and Ukraine
The Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, Ivan Vashjunik, said that the preparations will soon fall under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the confidence in Ukraine in the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux and the evidence that they believe that Ukraine is capable of organising the European Championship together with Poland," Vassjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there’s still a lot to do in both countries.”
In terms of the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both host countries are left behind.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't spend more time.
We need to work at a high speed now," said Grigori Ssurkisz, president of the Ukrainian Football Federation.
"The UEFA will keep an eye on us all the time."
In Poland, they were destined to take an even more radical step.
The National Olympic Committee has suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN Alliance after several scans, replaced by independent supervisor Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met on the initiative of Minister for Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is “a complete risk that PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP news agency.
"We assured in a letter to UEFA President Michel Platini that this will not adversely affect the preparations for the 2012 European Cup."
Only last season several first league teams had to be placed in the lower class due to manipulation and eventually the league squad had to be postponed.
The angry Dennis Quaid is back.
The actress wanted to advertise a new film, she talked about her privacy in the interview - and now she's in trouble with her ex-husband. And Ryan, the Hollywood star, has classified her ex-husband, Dennis Quaid.
The one who tries and cuts back
Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid: The two Hollywood actors have a ugly fight with each other seven years after their divorce - in front of the public.
In an interview with American magazine InStyle, Ryan said for the first time last week about the reasons for the divorce: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, causing a lot of pain."
It was only after the divorce that he found out how many women Dennis had cheated on him.
The psychic striptease is due to Ryan's new film, "Women," which tells the story of a marriage breakdown.
Dennis Quaid resolutely reacted to the statement of his unfaithful husband: “It’s awful,” the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News newspaper, “that he will replicate and recount the story of our relationship.
In addition, the 16-year-old boys, Jack, are repeatedly reminded of the many pain and change that divorce causes to a child.
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and recently became the father of a couple.
Therefore, the answer ends with the following page cut: "My life continues anyway.
I'm happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is in great order."
Prices of flights and hotel rooms are declining
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, in Germany, flights have become no less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of flights and hotel rooms have again become more favorable - this is the result of a study by American Express travel and financial services provider.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and found a significant price drop in the second quarter following the first quarter price increase.
After prices have risen for years in the hotel market, hotels have become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 per cent compared to 2007.
In the period from April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most clearly seen in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is that American Express sees the dollar at a low rate, which has led to "a stirring travel benefit for American tourists."
Hotel room prices are more affected by financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than industrial cities such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the city of Norway, the 26.3 percent increase in hotel prices is a European record.
In the first quarter, there was also an increase in the price of airline tickets.
Due to the cost of kerosene, passengers in the tourist class on average had to pay 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and long-haul flights with high fuel consumption were 29.2 percent more expensive.
Between April and June, prices for tourist-class flights decreased by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but prices for business and first-class flights showed only a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9 per cent and fell by 23.6 per cent in the second quarter.
The cost of domestic flights in Germany has fallen by half, according to the study.
The reason for the price drop is, on the one hand, the declining economic growth, the company says.
Demand has been weakened in many segments of the airline market.
On the other hand, as a result of the Open Skies Agreement which liberalises air travel between the USA and Europe, the pressure on the competitive position is increasing.
The tense situation demonstrates that airlines are canceling their lost flights, and many airlines have reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe it affects 24 airlines.
A HSV 1:0 truth to Gladbachot
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV was placed at the top of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay will still not be able to find the functional team.
Kristoffer Klein enlargement Deep-flying for national team Marko Marin.
The gladbach player was only late in the game, and lifting back from the gate.
His exact message was convincingly left his lips.
She just knew she was right.
"We're ready for the second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hallway leading to the Hamburg Arena cabins.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break was over, and most of them sat in their place again.
Rieger had been a HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades, enjoying greater authority than some driving players.
Thus, his request for a hearing was found at the appropriate place.
Cornelius Jol's assistant was in a hurry, and agreed to show his thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, Hamburg coach.
His order could have said the same thing: Here with the second goal!
Implementation of the command is lacking.
"Today, the scenery was not always beautiful," said Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhardt also “imagined” the thing.
The 1:0 (1:0) goal score is due to Mladen Petric's head (11th); and the fact that the very weak gladbachians were unable to cause pain to the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
The spectators were already celebrating their own Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and a table on the runner-up, which featured the teams as the champions’ classmates.
It's gonna be a party-free birthday.
"We know where to put the thing," said Marcell Jansen.
He notes that the interim certificate in the table indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of the HSV.
Although the team is slowly finding itself, thanks to its late-committed works – Brazilian Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and Jansen from FC Bayern – it still does not shine.
"We need more senses and communication," Jol demanded.
After the voting
There is fear on Wall Street.
As a result of the first news of the failure of the rescue package, the Dow Jones temporarily dropped by 700 points.
It was the biggest point loss in one day in history.
Later, the Dow grew stronger than someone else.
At 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer was down 5 percent and stood at 10,579 points.
Nasdaq, a tech paper trader, fell by more than seven percent minus 1548 points.
Dow's biggest loser at the moment was American Express with a 14 percent loss, followed by Bank of America with 12 percent.
None of the papers were reinforced.
Goldman Sachs Bank's shares fell almost 10 percent.
A few days earlier, Warren Buffett, a major investor, bought a stake in the bank.
As part of the rescue operation, it is planned to provide resources for the purchase of so-called dubious mortgage securities.
However, the amount is not at the same time, but is gradually being paid.
In exchange, the State would receive the credits of the stock option of the financial institutions, which could be repaid if the exchange rates evolved properly, reducing the burden on the State’s treasury.
European and American and stock exchanges are on the decline
The billion-dollar aid provided to European and American banks does not share investors’ doubts.
Hipo Real Estate’s stock market is falling and the Daxo is caught with it.
The US Dow Jones indicator is declining despite the money market savings planned by the state.
The dramatic exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank undermined the German Stock Exchange Guide (Dax).
Despite the federal government and private banks’ bailouts, the value of Munich’s real estate financing shares fell to a quarter, with Commerzbank weakening by more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell below the mentally important 6,000-point limit and scored 5839 points with a 3.7% minus.
Stock markets all over the world are on their knees.
In New York City, Wall Street is open with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government’s <0x24>700 billion bailout will not be enough to boost the money markets.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trading, down 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House wants to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote will take place on October 1.
The rest of Europe’s stock exchanges have only one direction: in London, the FTSE index showed a weakening of 3.2 per cent, in Paris, the CAC 40 lost 2.9 per cent.

Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing discouragement among researchers for years. Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been flying in space for almost 18 years.
Because of the soon-to-freeze fuel lines, the ice is threatened with death.
Scientists have for years been confused by a mysterious phenomenon, the swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is the gravitational impulse of space probes, during which they gain additional momentum in a celestial body, such as the Earth's gravitational space.
This way, the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe, like the Ulysses sun probe, also used this physical trick.
However, what has shocked researchers for years: Flying objects do not behave fully as they would have been expected under the ancient law of gravity.
Instead, abnormalities occur in the speed.
The probes unexpectedly accelerate or slow down.
So far, physicists have not found any explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was called swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general relativity theory may not be entirely correct, which will assume the mass attraction of matter as the curvature of space.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to believe Einstein was not mistaken, and attempts to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter that astronauts discover in the universe.
"Dark matter may be responsible for the anomaly, which may even be found near Earth," Adler writes.
Astronomers have only learned about the existence of dark matter ten years ago.
Obviously, it develops a gravitational force that can be observed by its effect on other deities.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, i.e. no electromagnetic radiation, particularly visible light does not emit or emit back.
Scientists estimate that one-fifth of the entire mass of the universe is made up of dark matter.
Abducted Tourists in Egypt Released
After spending ten days in captivity, tourists deported to Egypt are free again, the Italian foreign minister said.
The Sudanese kidnappers have demanded millions of euros of ransom.
In the shooting that preceded the release of the hostages, six hostages allegedly lost their lives.
Five German citizens have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom are already underway.
Again and again, the Germans become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists displaced in the Sahara are free.
This was reported unanimously by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabiya Arab TV and Italian media.
According to the TV broadcaster TG 24, the Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of the release: "Our honorary associates and other hostages have been released.
We are currently examining their health condition,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian national, as well as eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and secure, Egyptian state television said.
19 participants of the desert expedition are reportedly already on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shootings before the release of hostages remain obscure: According to an Egyptian security official, the hostages have already shown a willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army killed six of them by surprise.
"The problem has been solved.
They accepted the ransom,” the official said.
"It was just a matter of taking hostages," when suddenly there was a "surprise."
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers on Sunday at the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two.
The hostages demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should have been handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The al-Masri al-Jom newspaper, referring to a German mediator, reported that the release of the hostages is delayed because the kidnappers are concerned about their own integrity.
According to the report, the hostages freed the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men are held by the kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo was unwilling to take a position on the report.
‘Suicide’ of the father-in-law’s violence
The court found that a woman had committed suicide because her grandfather had raped her for years.
Michael Trerise, who lives in the town of Stithians in Cornwall, spent six years in prison after confessing to an attempted eight-course sexual assault.
The criminal court in Truro found out that she regularly tied Stephanie Randle, her mother-in-law, between the ages of five and seven.
In one of his confessions, Trerise wrote, "I feel guilty for his death."
At the hearing, Randle committed suicide at the age of 34 at his home in the Mutley district of Plymouth on April 1, 2007.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied and tied her eyes before sex while her mother worked in a nursery.
Trerise divorced from his wife in the 1980s and chose Cornwall as his residence again.
His granddaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it turned out that Ms. Randle, who spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was chased by horror images of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, a prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle, who used to passionately liked surfing and cycling, said her friends were "emotional dead" and "resigned from life."
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, was found dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
Probably smashed himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle was confused with his daughter's father-in-law, who ended his confession in a letter saying, "I've always tied up and clapped his eyes.
I wasn't sexually harassed.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You were an extremely strange fetishist, and I’m sure it was awful for his victim, especially when he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family member ended up with the victim committing suicide.
But what is even more memorable is the fact that if you didn’t do so, the case might never have been brought to court.”
The judge added, "I draw attention to how Stephanie's parents have said the crime you've committed has affected her daughter over the years.
If that didn’t happen, she would probably have been a hopeful, successful, and happy young woman.”
An Officer Who Lost Important Data Is Accused
According to the BBC, a government official has been charged with violating official secrecy, who had forgotten strictly secret documents on a train in June.
The man was on an expert mission from the Department of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the lightest accusation of violation of the law, and there is no suspicion of intentional perpetration.
Frank Gardner, a BBC Defence Ministry reporter, said the move surprised many at the Whitehall.
"They believed that the Ministry of Defense and the government would treat the case as an internal matter," he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, has been charged under section 8.1 of the Act. This section is about the retention of information.
The Public Prosecutor's Office suggested that the Metropolitan Police charge against the prosecutor be represented by the man for his rather sensitive work with the Joint Intelligence Commission.
The documents he lost also included covert investigations of al-Qaeda and Iraqi military capabilities.
They were informed of the decision on Monday and moved from their home to an unknown location.
The apartment building associations will pay the B&amp;B account
Britain’s housing associations are expected to account for more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has spent <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect deposits at Bradford’s Bingley account holders.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use the funds of the depositors, including 59 housing associations.
Adrian Coles, president of the Association of Housing Builders Alliances (BSA), said it was “annoying” that companies and members would have to pay.
The <0x24>14 billion loan will eventually be repaid after the repayment of Bradford’s Bingley loans.
However, the interest accumulated in the meantime is charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation System has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing associations are among them.
It is outrageous that the institutions that have so far been cautious ... now have to pay the bills of those institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that every company has to pay in proportion to the amount of deposit it has. The companies share 18% of the costs with each other.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the loan amount will reach <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to defer <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay their first year interest.
Adrian Coles, the director-general of the housing union, told the BBC that he felt the measure was unfair.
“It is deplorable that those institutions have to pay the bills of the much less cautious institutions that were cautious at the time of the resurgence of the housing market.”
According to the BSA, none of the companies have been destroyed since they started operating in 1945.
"In all respects, we need to investigate this case in the next few weeks to decide how we can protect housing companies and their members from a significant amount of bills," Cole added.
The interest rate in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September to the end of March of this year.
A full yearly interest will be paid in 2010, which can be twice as high as it is today.
Since housing associations are self-help organizations, without shareholders, members will eventually have to pay the bill either at higher fees or through lower interest received after their deposits.
The price of milk rises by five penny per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The dairy company in Jersey has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of milk by another five penny per litre from Monday.
This year, this is the second price increase since the two-penny increase in February and after a survey by an advisory firm.
The resellers themselves decide whether to continue the price hike to consumers.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of milk in Jersey last changed in 2002.
Bangladesh's former MP's request for freedom of defence has been rejected.
The Bangladeshi court has rejected former MP Sheikh Hasina's request for defence on bail, which means he can be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyer said the court denied him defending him over the charge that he had stolen 50 million takas from a businessman at the time of his parliamentary term.
This case is just one of the countless corruption charges brought against him.
Sheikh Hasina's old political opponent Khaleda Ziat was released this month in custody.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but his party, the Awami League, is demanding that the country’s military-backed interim government give him full freedom first.
According to the reports, although they have been conditionally released to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear from the conditions for placing the free leg, whether they will be able to keep their freedom when they return to the country.
His lawyers say he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the appellate court.
"The appellate court dismissed Sheikh Hasina's application for custody by saying that it was not necessary, as she was temporarily freed and involved in overseas medical treatment," Rafique-ul Huq's lawyer said.
"We will appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal."
According to his lawyers, he needs to defend his release so he can return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
A leader of the Awami League said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
He was arrested last year after the military-backed temporary government took over power, but in June he was released from prison to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Concerns about the Afghan polio vaccination programme
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have been left out of the recent polio vaccination program due to violence against the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations organized a vaccination campaign in six provinces.
However, they said they were unable to reach children living in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said this happened despite the Taliban’s promise: they will not attack or hinder the work of thousands of vaccinated personnel.
BSkyB's appeal against ITV has been rejected
They rejected BskyB’s appeal against the decision of the Competition Committee, which directed it to reduce its interest in the rival television broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Court of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its share of ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
In the past, the Commission found that the participation of BSkyB hinders the competition and puts the company under unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB acquired its shares in 2006, effectively preventing NTL, which has since been renamed Virgin Media, from acquiring ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Office reported that the shares acquired by BSkyB from ITV jeopardised the independence of ITV, encouraging the Committee on Competition to initiate an investigation.
The director of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom’s oversight were all opposed to the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in ITV shares is a non-reasonable and disproportionate compensation - in particular given that BSkyB stated that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
Another Investigation of the U.S. Attorney’s Case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the deportation of nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006.
The move was followed by the fact that the report prepared by the Inspector General of the case case criticized the decisions of government officials.
The reporter condemned White House officials, lawmakers and former Chief Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez.
The investigation was ordered because he was afraid that the prosecutors would be detained for political reasons.
Nora Dannehy, the Special Prosecutor will now investigate whether the officials interviewed during the investigation have tried to lie to prevent justice.
"Severe allegations of a possible crime have not yet been investigated and have not been clarified," said Glenn Fine, Chief Inspector.
One of the main suggestions was to appoint a special prosecutor with the authority to force witnesses to testify.
The series began with the removal of nine prosecutors from the U.S. Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, it was said that the prosecutors were fired because of their poor performance.
However, it was later revealed that the detained prosecutors had no worse rating than many of their other colleagues, so many concluded that the political considerations behind the dismissals had been drawn.
Some prosecutors were involved in high-ranking Republican congressmen's criminal proceedings, while others were unwilling to investigate charges of election fraud against Democrats.
U.S. Attorneys are conducting investigations on behalf of the government and conducting court cases.
They can be defeated at any time, but for political reasons they cannot be removed from their positions.
At the time, the head of the judiciary, Alberto González, became the target of the raids, and finally resigned.
A number of other officials in the judicial case also resigned.
In the Chief Inspector's report, Gonzales strongly condemned the role played in the case. According to him, the chief prosecutor is "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, "dismissed" his managerial role, and "extraordinarily out of control"
Other officials — including Karl Rove, the former aide of the senior Bush — have been convicted of not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf Epic Recognition Cap
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards gallery for the epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive a special gold-grade award next week at the London ceremony, said she considers the award an honor.
The nine-minute, fifty-second song Meat Loaf was the title track for the 1977 album Meat Loaf.
Coldplay has received the most nominations for this year's awards, in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are a few songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is like that."
The song obtained by Jim Steinman demanded a very large sound, and that sound was Meat Loafé.
The song began with a two-minute musical session.
It was released as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 on the hit charts.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" has been on the charts for nearly nine years, and has since sold over 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf - his real name is Marvin Lee Aday - has recently been suffering from health problems. Among other things, he was undergoing surgery in 2003 due to a heart attack after crashing on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel a few concerts due to a celestial jaundice.
It was later revealed that cysts were found on his ear.
Unknown metropolitan street, which is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of highways, roundabouts, and other adjoining streets, some of which are famous, others simply practical.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long-lived locals could hardly tell where the Extra Place is located, mostly because they have never heard of it before.
The small street is in East Village, and it runs north from First Street - without reaching Second Street - between Bowery and Second Street.
Approximately 9 m wide and 36 m long, and is much more like a dusty shark than a main road.
There are no street signs.
It is practically impossible to find it on a standard map.
However, there are admirers on the street.
There is, for example, Avalon Bay, the builder of the newly built First Street luxury buildings.
You want to rebuilt the Extra Place, and you want to ensure that you can get to the shops and stores of new buildings on a cleaner way.
Admirers of the street include the neighbors who have long lived here, who were caught in the street of the csonka, that it was the only remnant of the neighborhood's past before renovations.
However, it is not in the interest of the street owner, the city’s building maintenance and development department, to stick to it.
This month, at a meeting of the district municipal area management committee, the city and representatives of Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer the street to remain in the management of the city and asked for a new plan for next month, said Susan Stetzer, the head of district council number 3.
“There are very few areas already in the city and we want the Extra Place to continue to remain in the city,” he said.
"There may be some suggestions for renewal and management that Avalon can make, but we also want to guarantee that it will remain accessible to the public."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wants to rebuilt the small street and would like to provide seating. Some of these would be used by a café, which the builder is expected to rent an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not stick to its ownership.
"The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to renew this defunct shark and turn it into a pleasant public hell," he said, adding that the city had suggested buying it.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Building Conservation Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and noted that the office’s task was to develop buildings, not to manage them.
For its more colourful neighbour, the Extra Place does not have much historical significance compared to the Bowery.
In 1802, Philip Minthorne's large estate was distributed among his many children, and no one was required to make the narrow landslides.
Closed in 2006, the punk-rock monument, the CBGB's rear entrance was opened to the Extra Place, and the street is perhaps the most famous photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a great location," said Danny Fields, manager at Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, cloth cells, barbed wire and poster pieces, and wall sheets and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how they took possession of the middle class East Village, oppose the sale of the Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, no matter how modest, should remain in the possession of the community.
Others refer to the Extra Place as a rarity, which is a piece of the city that has remained virtually unchanged and that must be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, the author of the blog "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" ("The Book of Kings: A bitter nostalgia looking at the process of the city's extinction") posted a part of the story about the Extra Place in his book "The New Yorker" in his 19-page "The New Yorker"
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, small suitcase that is still dark during the day, bordered by rust, iron storage racks and spatula windows, and where the weekly newspapers carry the wind in the channels."
The street, with some exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat crossed the street at the end, next to the rear door, which used to lead to the CBGB, and now belongs to a higher-priced clothing store.
There was graffiti on the walls, and an empty 0.75-litre bottle of cheese lay next to a dumped, fresh newspaper shell.
Some passengers have said that they rarely come to mind the Extra Place, but they think the renovation will take place.
Fields said that he thinks some underestimate the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
"I have spent the most beautiful years of my life in dark, clumsy and unpleasant places," he said.
Discussion on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
In this section, the Education Observer discusses Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi’s views on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an experienced researcher in California studies at the Pacific Institute of Public Policy Research and the Director of Educational Research, is "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs Election Options."
It is not easy to walk in favor of voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are also included here.
According to Obama’s campaign, “Afro-American and Spanish-language students are significantly less likely to get a degree than white students,” and that’s true.
In order to overcome such differences in performance, Obama’s educational plan specifically supports, among other things, “transient bilingual education” for English learners.
At the same time, for Obama, the question is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which places emphasis on non-English school education, is overridden by his interest in overcoming high-performance differences.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep Contracting General School in the eastern part of Los Angeles County.
Most of the school’s students are Spanish-language and low-income.
More than one-third of students - many of whom have recently arrived - learn English.
Nonetheless, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 state mathematics exam.
Similarly, it is impressive that 93% of fourth graders have completed excellent English language and literature studies.
This incredible achievement has not been achieved with the means that Obama would give priority to.
Sixth Street focuses on repetition, exercise, continuous assessment of skills, and rejection of excuses.
In addition, and this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's educational principle of "complete immersion" of English-students in the linguistic environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of the English language in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said: "We had a tremendous success in entering a classroom without realizing who the student was who had just arrived from Mexico 12 months ago."
"It works," he said, "it works for us."
Would Obama set an example for other schools like the Sixth Street Prep, which have a large number of Spanish-language and English-language students?
The results achieved by the school should be clear to make the answer, however, because of its own party's education policy (the National Educational Associations have long supported bilingual education), and since Obama himself can consistently stand out for bilingual education, our bilingual education can not be assured.
While agreeing that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently expressed disapproval of the issue when he said that people should not be so worried about the legislation "exclusively English".
Instead, he said, "but they should reach for their children to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to achieve a reduction in the differences in results, he should seriously study the models that work, instead of looking down and taking them to nothing.
Oil prices have fallen sharply due to renewed concerns about the economy
On Monday, oil prices fell sharply over concerns that the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets will not be able to excite the economy.
Securities of crude oil fell by seven percent to <0x24>99.80 in the morning at the New York Trade Fair.
Prices have fallen by more than <0x24>20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, the commodity sector has been plagued by financial turmoil in Wall Street, and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices reached <0x24>145.29 per barrel in July, they fell back to almost <0x24>90 per barrel earlier this month before they were again affected by the immense uncertainty of the financial markets.
On Monday, the concern brought investors back to power even after the congressional leaders announced that they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the economic rescue action, which is the largest in history to date.
The news is shading the concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for a long time.
As a result of the emerging crisis, Citigroup will acquire the banking division of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, as a result of the despairing weekend negotiations, "the bailout does not seem to have been able to excite the preference of the stock market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that demand for commodities - such as oil - will also decline.
“The future of the stock market, interest rates and exchange rates has become uncertain around the world,” an analyst at Deutsche Bank told investors.
"We believe that the market for goods will not be avoided by the 'Epidemia'.
From the point of view of commodities, the biggest question is to what extent the U.S. "disease" infects the whole world, especially with regard to China."
As economic growth slowed down oil consumption, banks’ analysts were depressed by their expectations for the coming year, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices by 20% for 2009.
With the bravura of the second quarter, the team set the record
After spending more than eight seasons in the Jets than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, who played in the defensive end position, thought he had seen everything.
But then he watched the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational game.
"I've never seen one like that before," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals teammates played in full harmony with the sky’s turbulent, dark clouds.
Brett Favre, quarterback, gave Laveranues Coles a 12-yard touchdown pass. This became the perfect for an afternoon during which their unfolding cooperation greatly improved.
Favre gave Coles two touchdown passes in this quarter, including two consecutive cornerbacks that fell 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't regret the fatigue," Favre said of all the passes given to Coles.
"He's a damn good player.
So far, we have been able to communicate well with each other, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were balling, the defense stopped Cardinals manager Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, in the cornerback position, took a bad throw and dropped it 32 yards, reaching a touchdown.
Eric Smith, a safety player, jumped into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker, managed to kick the ball out of Warner's hand.
This last round could have been the most impressive moment in the game.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end and the Jets got it, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal, setting a 34-0 score.
This was the best result the Jets have achieved in a quarter.
When Jets coach Eric Mangini was asked to characterize the game's destructive character, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When they told him that they had both – in the third quarter the Cardinals scored 21 points without the Jets – Mangini said, “I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter much better than the third.
We got a lot of points in a short time."
Relaxed Gebrselassie breaks his own world record
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many consider it the best mid- and long-distance runners ever to have set their own world record in Berlin on Sunday, making him the first to run 42.2 kilometres in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win at 2:03:59 on the comfortably flat track, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds to a previous result at 2:04:26, which he achieved in Berlin last year.
At the age of 35, he set the 26th world record for Gebrselassie's career in so many areas that he won a world championship at almost every stage from the 1500 metres to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon for fears – which, in retrospect, may have proved too cautious – that air pollution would exacerbate asthma problems.
He was nominated for the Berlin Marathon.
Under almost perfect conditions - in the daytime, initially at 9 <0xC2><0xB0>C and finally at 13 <0xC2><0xB0>C - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, unbelievable, at a speed of 2 minutes and 56 seconds per kilometer.
Since runners who had not started a marathon before, such as Gebrselassie and Kenyan Paul Tergat, have turned to longer distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the last decade since Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in 1998 at 2:06-05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago his two legs were swollen and he could not practice for two weeks.
Obviously, during the forced rest, she was refreshed and not inflamed.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had doubts, but in the end everything was fine.”
He has received some criticism - especially from Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rivalry - that he uses too many tools during his races, usually avoids many world-famous marathon runners, leaning on his tracks as if he were running, and the world records are on this track.
However, this criticism hardly reduces the greatness of Gebrselassie in long-distance running.
Gebrselassie scored a half-point at 1:02:04 with four Kenyan runners-up on Sunday.
Two leading Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the runners were exhausted.
Not much more than 4.8 kilometres before the goal, Gebrselassie left Kwambai with a final sprint, finishing second at 2:05:36, upgrading to the best of the individual by 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third at 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, who is now a German national, finished a remarkable year with her seventh fastest win, 2:19:19.
The world summit is held by British Paula Radcliffe with a time of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London Marathon with a 2:24:14 result.
Due to his alleged back injury at the Beijing Olympics, he quickly recovered and won the Berlin Marathon, which was the third long marathon run in which he took part.
He won the race with a clever calculation: firstly, he allowed Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance a group of four, gaining significant lead, and then after running about 30 km.
Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa scored second with 2:21.31, while Kenyan Helena Kiprop scored third with 2:25:01.
A Separate City, the Pride and Trials of the Blacks
In the Greater Orlando Experience Park – a few miles from everything that is shiny, loud and huge – lies a quiet small town where the pride and complexity of African American life was born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city to integrate into the country, and which was Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, is no longer as simple as it described in 1935: "five lakes, three cricket tracks, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, and a lot of guacamole."
Now it's a tourist destination.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have already attended the annual Zora Festival. The eatonville celebration series is honoured by the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance, Hurston.
Yet, in many respects, the city it described and made a tourist attraction – which is also included in the Florida Travel Guide published by the Project of the Federal Writers of the Era – is distinct from the surroundings.
As independent, dignified and engaging as it was in the 1930s, when, according to a letter from Hurston, the Florida, urban blacks were often unwilling to share their true thoughts with white people who "know so little about us that they don't know about us."
Even in that year, when black presidential candidate Barack Obama encourages an open exchange of ideas on the racial issue, many here are untrustworthy of the views of outsiders.
"We're very careful about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, who has lived here all his life and is a member of the city's oldest church.
"You really have to tell me."
Eatonville has long been characterized by the paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historically significant model of black exposure, and at the same time a community of nearly 2,400 people, where poverty indicators reach double the national average.
Partly a literary node, and partly an example was created as a result of American slavery, sometimes neglected, sometimes to praise, the southern, urban, black culture, which flourishes in the shade of pine trees.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the inhabitants here are proud and defensive at the same time.
And the image from Eatonville has been important since Zora (here everyone calls Hurston).
In books written in an honest, strong dialect - such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) - he presented his hometown to the world.
The five paragraphs of the Florida Travel Guide transformed the city, which is located next to Route 17. This route leads from Florida’s long-forgotten center to one of the scenes of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was courageous in both life and literature and drumming, introduced his readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then explored the more confidential spheres.
He wrote, "From the road to the right we find the modern public school, with a brown-based white shell, carefully maintained yards and playgrounds that Howard Miller cares about, although he can barely write and read."
He mentioned Dash's new husband, and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all sorts of drinks and anything that might be needed in the temporary accommodations."
Thus, in a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to autonomy, but at the same time to illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Obviously, the Fodor's travel guide presented it differently.
This description really didn't like everyone.
"So she said things the way they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls. Hurston made them immortal by quoting the whimsical songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as the living stranger who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin pointed out that when Hurston got into the city, he usually arrived in a smokeless Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes, and in long dresses, in a city where people are still proud of their dignified outfits.
Most people were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were filmed.
"People were always happy to see Zora," Franklin said.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added in his chair, "He never stayed for too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were no longer published.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with most of the world, had forgotten about him.
Although he was once a popular writer, Langston Hughes' contemporary, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in an unidentified grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he previously lived.
In Eatonville there were no significant memorials or large, public readings.
“I don’t think they understood how much it enriched the world, or what it left us at all,” said Valerie Boyd, author of the 2003 Hurston biography, “Breaked in the Storm.”
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-door road through the city instead of the two-door main street, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the community's life.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated the Interstate 4 motorway connecting states on the city’s western border.
The proposal came when Eatonville still leaned on after a difficult period of history.
Among other things, forced integration ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, racial meddling struggles fueled hatred with the community.
“At the time, a team of white boys came across and they threw the people sitting on the road with oranges and other things,” Franklin said.
"There was a woman who died in this.
They threw a Greek woman out of a car.”
In a letter to The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court's ruling on violent integration, stating that the Brown v. Board of Education's ruling was "preferably not infringing in any way."
Today, residents say that the school's desegregation was positive in some respects, weakened the cohesion of the Eatonvilles, and undermined the self-confidence of young people.
"Black children are used to being killed - I remember - the man buried his teacher in the morning and in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, a nonprofit organization called "Keep the Eatonville Community".
"This took as long as the students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
"We didn't embrace our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean, there were cultural differences between us," Nathiri said.
However, human rights have helped many other Zora Neale Hurston's rise - in black writers, actors and artists who have excelled in prejudices, as he did, with an outspoken self-confidence and lifeliness like the following: "How can you guide me?
It's incomprehensible to me."
In 1975, Alice Walker retreated to Hurston's unnamed grave and began to fight to regain her reputation.
Five years later, a renowned biography written by Robert E. Hemenway was put on the shelves of bookshops, which re-emerged Hurston among America’s exemplars.
The road construction project had just begun when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was re-centered.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbor looked at him as a savior.
In 1988, the community began organizing a Hurston Festival to show what would ruin the county with its main route.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and since then, many are returning to the celebration every January.
A few years later, the county abandoned its proposal for road construction.
"Owing to the five-stroke of the main road, the community has resurrected, switched to full speed, which is a real civic pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd simply said, "That's when you saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the city’s image of itself.
Increasing numbers of out-of-town residents have appeared, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the church in 1993, and the locals began to reassess the past.
Eatonville was listed on the National Historical List in 1998.
In 2006, a new one-stop library (of course named after Hurston) was opened on Kennedy Street, which was rebuilt and refurbished.
Eatonville is still Florida's cockroaches: it is less than ten kilometres from downtown Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a suburban sidewalk in the summertime; as small as when a black family founded in the 1880s.
(And 90% of the population is black.)
The outsiders who come here looking for Eatonville's story and story are still being welcomed with caution.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things - such as Eatonville's oldest fresco, painted by a white man and depicting blacks working on the ground - should not be photographed.
In Eatonville, many — including self-confident teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to the bright red — are afraid of misunderstanding their distinctive community.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival became wider, the pride of the homeland also grew.
In particular, young people are increasingly looking at Eatonville as Hurston saw his own species: they are wonderful, they are not better, they are not worse, they are just as proud, they are creative, they are busy, they are crazy and they are more confused than they are.
Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after graduating from college to work with the local government or the police, says he's in need of help.
And it seems that even the younger ones have learned to properly characterize Eatonville, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twin: Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most of the people who are just passing through here think this city is nothing compared to the rest," Kenon said recently after the ceremony on Sunday.
“But if someone stops and takes some time to get to know their history, then it’s a very beautiful city.”
We here in New York all speak the language of finance.
Nothing on the surface has changed.
If tourists didn’t care about the newspaper fee and the huge TV broadcasters on Times Square, I wouldn’t have noticed they’re in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with the glass-walled, bee-shaped offices over their heads, the bankers and risk fund managers who hold New York in power are living the hardest days since 1929.
The runners are still pushing their metal tea trolleys on the pavements, delivering muffin-laden dishes for the morning meetings.
There are still Spanish lip-men crawling among the mosques, shoving fifty-somethings of ivory, hanging on their shoulders, like a yoghurt.
Office workers are still standing in line for their morning sweet baked goods on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I didn’t feel that there would be any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the bad news, I didn’t decide to open a new bank account.
Although I deliberately planned to deal with the matter in my JP Morgan Chase bank account during the afternoon rest, there were already about 20 people in front of me in the row.
Not at the cash register window where you can collect or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for a ticket to the Macy's store, and where new customers have a bank account.
Many before me - I knew later from Starr, the banker "assigned to me" - were in line with the same intentions as me.
Unlike me, however, they have already withdrawn money from smaller banks located in their residence, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They took money from so-called savings banks (which are such things as housing unions), loan unions, and small-town savings banks that operate in only one state and are supposed to treat customers as family members.
Over the past year, 15 such banks have been quietly destroyed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with <0x24>327 billion in capital, has been bankrupt, and when the New Yorkers returned home on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, was saving <0x24>440 billion in savings.
The office and store workers in front of me, fearing another collapse, took their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe haven, to a bank that makes most capital injection purchases on Wall Street.
The simple people of New York have become experts in finance in the last few weeks.
A woman on the phone at a local Chinese store was talking about Lehman Brothers bank bank bankruptcy and its huge-looking CEO, Dick Full, as if complaining about a lusta colleague.
And Lyn, my apartment's underwear warden for 50 years, we weren't talking about Brad and Angelina, or about my food delivery, as usual.
He said to me after I went to the bank, "I've invested all my savings in money market assets.
I've changed, you're not risking."
Muslims humiliate funerals while Austria turns to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, from the Belgian right-wing party, from the Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, in which he presented the "Várzesz Tém<0xC3><0xB2>rsós" project.
Traffic signs depicting mosques crossed with a red line were shown on the sides of the road.
Police say far-right extremists are responsible for the burial of Austrian Muslim cemeteries, which took place on the same weekend as far-right parties made significant progress in the national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were damaged at the Trauni cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, according to the police.
The perpetrators painted Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some tombs, but according to the investigators, they only tried to hide their extreme motives, which stemmed from the hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident can be linked in any way to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply disturbed” by the funeral, which took place shortly before the end of the Muslim month of Ramadan.
In the meantime, Austria is conducting a conscience review following yesterday’s parliamentary elections, during which the language of the political balance turns to the right.
The two far-right parties, which gained almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for the Liberal Party and the future of the Alliance for a strongly anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were labeled as hostile to their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the president of the Freedom Party, which has gained more than 18% of the votes, expressed his displeasure with the campaign against headdresses and buckets, as well as food allegedly associated with Islam.
At the party’s final summit in Vienna, he spoke of a “European Brotherhood” to help prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
According to public opinion surveys and analyses conducted immediately after the far-right elections, the change was largely due to the young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter was banned from travelling abroad.
Garry Glitter, a well-known rock star convicted of child sexual assault, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges then decided on Glitter’s six-month ban to notify the authorities of his intention to travel through France to Spain.
Kentucky police on Thursday won a travel ban after submitting evidence to the court of verdicts against Glitter in connection with sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, whose real name was Paul Gadd, was not involved in the trial of the Ashford Magistrates in Kenya, but was represented by the lawyers of Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: "On Thursday, September 25, the Kenyan police filed an application to the Ashford Magistrates Court for preventing Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain scheduled for March 25.
"Paul Gadd did not appear personally."
The 64-year-old Glitter has notified the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because it is obliged to do so by the law on persons in the register of sexual offences.
You must notify the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
It is also obliged to notify the police at least seven days before the planned departure.
If he does not notify the authorities, they may be sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.
The Kentucky police said they don't want to talk about the individual cases inside Glitter County and where it's possible.
A spokesman for the Kenyan police said: "The Kenyan police will do everything in their power to protect children both in the country and abroad.
“In our opinion, it’s easier to check someone if they don’t leave the UK because we have a comprehensive system at our disposal so that we can manage potential risks more effectively.
"The most important task of the Kent police is to protect the Kent population. Through close cooperation, we are continuously monitoring the behaviour of persons in the registers of the perpetrators of sexual offences and their indigenous populations in the county."
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10- and 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he had to take a flight to London.
However, he claimed that he was feeling unwell and was not willing to fly to London.
The authorities in the countryside did not allow the passport examination, so he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities were also not allowed to enter the country, so he returned to Bangkok, where officials from the Land Police and the Immigration Office insisted he would return to the UK.
Finally, on August 22, he arrived at Terminal 3 of Heathrow Airport, and remained there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to the West London Court, uxbridge, because he was subject to a court order by Scotland Yard, in accordance with his request.
Glitter spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom in 1999 for possessing photographs depicting child rape.
According to a source from the Interior Ministry, Jacqui Smith, the interior secretary of state, reassured and welcomed that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
“I don’t take pictures on stage because I want to present the artist personally.” – Günther Bauer
There are no decorations, no hairstyles, no dancing shoes.
From the body of the great masters of flamenco, without the excitement of the performance: to get to know the ordinary faces of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the ordinary man.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in moments of intimacy, away from the audience, when we can otherwise take one or another personal movement, we can capture the depths of a captured view, or we can be amazed at the appearance of a non-scene, non-scene-scene object.
In the German photo series Günther Bauer's Flamenco-people, the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists is combined with this lesser-known everyday page of masters.
Through the photos, he presents his particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Photography Month, "reflects the growing international importance of flamenco day by day" - the creator believes, adding that the Flamenco people could be anyone's "player, because in the view of the images, the observers are not inclined to touch this tip
These people on the street are artists who are able to bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and to drown the audience.
At the same time, stage photography is not suitable for capturing their personality.
Their personality and character resides in the depths of their being.
“I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to inherit the personality of the great flamenco with the help of the camera.”
The Cante de las Minas Festival was inspired by Bauer’s long journey in 1997, during which he made portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a disc camera.
This portrait, thanks to its camera and theme selection, cite classical photography.
The use of various stylistic tools, however, interrupts with traditional image representation and suggests modernity. The following idea faithfully reflects Bauer's idea of flamenco: "It's a music with traditional roots, but it's changing day by day."
Not the dance, not even the song or the music itself, but rather the personality of the artist, his character enchants the audience.
These days, the master motif of the works in the El Fotómata gallery is the search for an encounter with the essence, the art magic, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and display.
The famous figures of flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, metallize this collection of photographs featuring sixty artists.
The project has also become a flamenco anthology, which will soon release an album featuring portraits presented at the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraits has been rooted in the idea of repeating it two years ago with the “SportARTproject” series “Portrait of Veterans Athletes”.
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is slightly different from this, the photographer adds: "I love photographing people, getting to know them, and getting into their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, photography is the most difficult genre of portrait.
You meet people, you meet people, you come together with personalities that you sometimes don’t even know, or who only spend a few minutes taking photos.
But in spite of these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.
The exhibition, selected from the contemporary flamenco portraits, with the title Flamenco-people, can be seen in the El Fotómata Gallery, under the number 20, in parallel with Alameda de Hércules, until October 16.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he is working on is "complete blindness"
The scene and the action are unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also struggling to write his new novel. The main character of the novel is an Irish nationalist, Roger Caseman, who has lived in the Congo and the Amazon for 20 years.
The literary Nobel Prize-winning writer also admitted at the Hay Festival Segovia yesterday that his current work was "completely blind" and "every sign that the novel should not be written".
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I'll do it, and I hope I'll someday be able to make a point" - with these words, his final presentation at the festival of the exchange of ideas, thoughts and opinions, which was hosted in the city of Aqueduct for four days, hosted by new writers and writers.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the celebration of literature, and he also changed his aspirations.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival award voted by the participants, an old edition of Dickens' novel "Our Common Friend". His presentation was filled with the Juan Bravo Theatre.
After Felix Romeo's greeting, he received a dedication from the audience, and soon the hour came to an end, during which the Peruvian writer told him with a wonderful memory and a great amount of humor how his passion for reading developed; his passion for reading, his passion for writing, his passion for writing, his passion for writing, and his desire to live and his passion for writing.
The Latin American novelist acknowledged that it is impossible to determine or prove whether books change our lives, but added, "I don't think that literature is a mere experience of fun or a life of blooming," because it has an effect on people's beliefs, aspirations, and aspirations.
Due to the weather in Mostoha, the farewell to Pozoblanco will be shorter, and the horse bike rides will be missed.
Traditionally, a horse-drawn bike ride was cancelled from the show yesterday morning as the final time of the Pozoblanco holidays, after the prospective horse-drawn towers found the arena unsuitable for the ride.
As a result, the committee decided, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, to stay on the road.
The meteorological inconsistencies have profoundly distorted the series of celebrations, as two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the second bullfight was left because of the rain.
The upcoming protagonists, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista Castilblanco would have fought with the bulls.
So it was only on Friday that they had a bullfight.
The winner, Daniel Luque, took three ears home as a trophy and was raised to the shoulder after a sophisticated and aesthetic struggle.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante won many awards and a trophy for his two bulls, but he could not thank the audience, rather than his own performance.
However, after that came El Juli, who contributed little to aging the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable walk with the second bull, a large part of the audience managed to get out of the soda.
In fact, a two-ton heavy-duty truck tried to escape the road control
Four o'clock in the morning, fifty minutes.
The Basque Regional Police is conducting traffic controls in the administrative area of Armin<0xC3><0xB2>n (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The authorities are stopping a van in which two people are travelling, and the passengers are trying to escape the measure.
The freight, more than two tons of hassis, at the same time was not surprising.
Investigators were chasing the passengers, arresting one, a 28-year-old man, and identifying him as A. A. J., the Interior Department of the Basque government said.
The arrested man is charged with drug trafficking and document fraud.
The incident took place in the administrative area of Armin<0xC3><0xBD>n, where employees of the <0xC3><0x81>lava Traffic Authority carried out traffic controls on the N-1 motorway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas, and then left the checkpoint.
The investigators chased him, and the vehicle stopped a few miles back on the stop, and his passengers fled from the highway to a forested area.
The Basque Regional Police finally captured one of them, and after reviewing the Iveco Daily truck, they booked its shipment, which weighed 2,178 kilograms.
The harnesses filling the rear of the vehicle were transported by the police to undergo a more thorough investigation and take the drug.
In addition, it was demonstrated during the inspection that the vehicle’s counterfeit ID card does not match the data on the truck’s papers, and therefore proceedings are initiated for counterfeiting of public documents against the detainee.
The Basque Regional Police is investigating the arrest of the other suspect, who, as mentioned above, escaped from the highway and the origin of the drug seized, on the one hand.
The 28-year-old accused, A. A. J., was sent to the police to carry out the necessary interrogations, and within a few hours, judicial measures began.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested over the weekend by police in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness said he tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange manoeuvres, a spokesman for California’s traffic surveillance magazine told People.
According to the witness, Locklear "pressed the gas to the floor at about 4:30 p.m., pushed the engine upwards, tried to leave the parking lot and went back and forth again with his sunglasses."
Not long later, the witness, who for the first time probably did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby highway and getting out of the car.
He also notified the police that he was "concerned about Locklear's life."
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially blocked the traffic on the highway.
"It seemed like a savage," so the police took him to a drug and alcohol test center specializing in this.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was a collaborator and alcohol consumption was almost immediately excluded. The spokesman also said that based on the first impression of officers, they thought Locklear was under the influence of the drug.
Lockleart was arrested and suspected of driving under the influence of an unidentified drug. He was transported to the local prison around 19:00, where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of an Arizona sanatorium two months ago, where he was treated for anxiety and depression.
Callazares calls on the Andalusian federation of the IU (United Left) to take action in the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the Secretary-General of the IU and the representative of the United Left, said today that the regional federation of the formula will make a decision in the case of the former Youth and Sports Council of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva.
"In these matters, I am far from a federalist, and this is certainly the responsibility of the Andalusian organization," Callazares pointed to the procedure that the party should apply against a former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that in detecting any irregularities committed by Silva, "transparency" should be borne in mind: "The IU has always been on the surface in order for such cases to be as transparent as possible."
He added that part of the training "is also a strict code of ethics for public employees."
"The Damned Blood", the epic creation of Garci
Benito Pérez Galdós was inspired by José Luis Garcit, who cited the famous anti-French uprising of the Spanish in the May Blood, which, with a budget of almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 million, is the largest production of his filmography.
Accordingly, in his well-known novelist work, the director has always tried to illustrate the admired human history and social analysis by him. All this was said today at the film’s presentation with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría.
The two-and-a-half hours of Blood will be featured in the movies on Friday, and will later be broadcast as a miniseries of Telemadrid for more than four hours.
The great admirer of the literature of José Luis Garci, Galdós, made his childhood dream come true with this film. All this is thanks to Aguirre of Esperanza, who entrusted him three years ago to his 200 pages from the Province of Madrid, to make a memorial film with the May 2nd.
The <0x24>15 million budget was fully funded by the Autonomous Province of Madrid, and it was a special opportunity for Garci: with an age-old decoration and signage, he was able to showcase "the confused Spaniards who, by mistake, were at the side of a bad ruler, who were at the side of a bad ruler, who fought for independence."
The director, however, expressed his regret that he could not count on the budget of the ghosts of Alatriste or Goya, who were more than doubled in Mayo's blood, so he was forced to miss a few scenes from the script, which - like many other times - Horatcio Valcàryeel.
So the director of the New Arrivals went to his usual way of working, taking up the scenes with the actors he started the trials with before the filming. Casting was not because Garci considers it to be a "mechanic," and because, as he said, we're in the movies, he's in the movies, and he's in the movies, and he's in the movies.
Several May Blood actors, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not appear on camera for the first time.
Garci, who has four Oscar nominations and can be proud of an Oscar, believes that this year's candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood, namely the May Blood, the Seven French Billiards and the final selection of the "Big Sun" should not be "one of the best-selling figures in the world."
Garci doesn't count on awards with this movie.
“At first you think you’re working for the future, then you realize that happiness is the only thing that counts, and in the end you’re happy that you’re making another movie,” Garci says with a 30-year professional career behind his back.
Isabel Bayón inquires about the life and art of the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer in Seville also commemorates a dancer in Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valencia), was born in the Triana neighborhood and moved to London with her parents at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in Eastern dances.
During his life as a pioneer, he fought for women's equality, whether Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and he fought against wearing dresses that blocked women's freedom of movement.
A dance and aesthetic revolution erupted in Europe during the war, and her life shocked Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gambia, she recommended Tortola to my attention, whose personality was really impressed.”
The flamenco dancer said: "It is not our goal to tell the story of her life, but to capture her soul.
I remember the titles of his dances with flamenco styles.
For example, from the "mystic dance" to the guaji, or from the "flying dance" to the tango.
“Sensually danced, and according to others, my style also characterizes it,” she says.
The performance is highlighted by two exceptional contributors: Miguel Poveda is now singing again after the Open Door at Isabel’s performance; and Matilde Coral, who in this case was exceptionally willing to work with an ex-student.
"Matilde shapes the older Tortola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you said yes to the request, it's very honourable that you're acting in my parts."
In addition, Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga music directors and guitarists, Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón singers; El Pájaro stunning brother, Rafa El Viola, as well as actor Juanfra Juárez, who "is always in love with the real diva."
The play also largely depicts the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe and arrives in landscapes that were still distant at the time, including India, the United States or Italy.
“I wanted to remind him because his personality had a big impact on his age, but at the same time he is no longer known and less valued by his work,” Bayon says.
The performance starts tonight at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium will also appear the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet"
The first illustrated edition of the diary of A Freshly Married Poet will be presented at the St. Stephen's Church in New York, where in May 1916 Juan Ramón Jiménez was married to Zenobia. The presentation is part of the program Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium, and the title is Culture.
In this way, Zenobia's and Juan Ramón Triennium's closing reissues of the work, the International Congress held in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize-winning poet's memorial, and the exhibition "The Provision of Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Opening of the Luminous Summer Tree" are held in New York.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government has collected a total of eight hundred copies from the diary of a newly married poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most diverse Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America is not so attractive.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that.”
The quote comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with Newman in the film Victims of Sensation, and reflects the shock and powerlessness caused by Newman's death in American cinema and throughout America.
How hard it was to get an Oscar.
He retired in 2007,
He was well-knownly ill,
But even so, his death has plagued everyone.
"Sometimes inability melts our feelings into words, and I've just lost a good friend," said Robert Redford, "with tears, it has made my life and this country better."
No one is afraid of being ridiculous or over-reacting.
One of the heroes of cinema and home went through a particularly dark period that was shackled by fear of terrorism and market conditions, a desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When such difficult times go by and many easily lose their virtues and very few people are left to look up to, you don’t have to be Luis Cernud to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of men, he embodied in reality the idea of beauty and justice in Plato.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and defender of lost and won cases, from the anti-drug foundation created in memory of his firstborn son who died in drug overdose to the creation of his home-made bio-food brand.
It was a real gift for a country that was hard to get past its suicidal food culture.
The staggering wave of admiration entered all of Hollywood, regardless of nationalities and origins.
The last James Bond, according to the Englishman Daniel Craig, was not a man, but an era of death with him.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, stated that his work with Newman was clearly the culmination of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy Newman from Australia, was named by him as his greatest inspiration.
"It's made the leash very high for all of us," said George Clooney, who is perhaps one of the few people who today are trying to follow Paul Newman's lifestyle: demanding honesty and serious and privacy away from cameras.
It’s not always easy if it’s possible in the middle of today’s media jungle.
Still, there are those who try, and Paul Newman's example.
She was divorced once, but then lived faithfully married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, and there would certainly have been many occasions of infidelity.
"Why do I eat hamburgers elsewhere when the fried meat is waiting at home?" he jokes.
In heaven, you can be proud that your daughters on earth are also fans, which is not so common in America.
"None of all the transformations was as proud as the role of a faithful husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather, and a dedicated human friend," he said.
The Road to the Olympics in Madrid
Indeed, many of us dream of a Madrid Olympics, and after the 2012 failed, it may be 2016.
But, I ask myself, are we really ready for it?
'Cause if we get out of yesterday's race, I don't think at all.
It was called the perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst of many I've ever been.
The clues of nonsense were characterised by, and if it were to be evaluated once, and I would be the investigator, the result would clearly be detrimental.
Well, let's move on and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began with the adoption of the fate number, because it had to be arrived earlier.
This is not a problem in itself yet, but if you go earlier, you should at least get everything at once (the chip includes, avoiding posture in the later row).
Well, that's not what happened.
At first only the number was passed on (first nonsense, just so go there earlier) and (after the usual row) what a surprise, it was only an S-shirt (second nonsense, since I have a point XL size)!
What kind of world do we live in?
Or because of the crisis, have they decided to save on material and only buy cheaper, small t-shirts?
But no matter what, these things are still blurred compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the horrifying early pickup of the chip, the row position took 15 minutes from the arrival, and even the backpack had to be handed down.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in a race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't given up the backpack yet, and when it finally did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made the more pleasant wait of more than 40 minutes, which was held by populist and stand-attack attempts.
I think we're going to get about 500 lung infections tomorrow, and some, including myself, we're not going to get our placement in real time, because I assume my chip has incorrectly recorded the start.
If I were to be asked about the perfect racing race, of course it wouldn’t happen to me.
So I think we can continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Searching for Microsoft (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Conference on Emerging Technologies, Microsoft presented the development of a new image-recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence, not too intelligent, which, however, is able to perform some basic tasks on a baseline basis.
This "receptionist" with a camera and a form and facial recognition system is able to recognize how many people are in the room, who they - in fact, notes what kind of clothes they wear - and hears and understands the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, you can group attendees based on conversations.
In the video, the lady of reception identifies a third party, but knows that she is not a member of the company talking to her and not an employee of the company.
He asks if you came to a visitor and ensures that you are in a hurry to help him.
All of this without the blue screen.
Impressive.
This is, of course, the music of the future.
At the moment, the company also has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, many have been told that Microsoft has changed its strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and includes fewer add-ons.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were to run only the necessary programs instead of the commercial eye, the machines would be five times faster – bravo, Steve, that’s something.
They invented the Spanish version, considering that Microsoft has so far attached more features and extras to Windows in every new version.
The change of direction will come back.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly in need of a background, and the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I also joined the theory that Google took the first step in competing with Windows.
Many have correctly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is an essential element for hardware and software dialogue.
She plays the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to her aunt.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but must be counted on the "death" of the operating system, not absolute, but in a relative sense.
Ballmer's statement this week supports this idea.
People are paying less attention to the operating system and more and more to the web browser.
We only turn on the computer to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and spend more time browsing than we spend in the windows world.
What is the benefit of most of the applications that come with the system?
Less is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complicated.
Microsoft’s goal is to better integrate its services online, and to finally present an alternative to Google.
Everything they need, I’ll give you an example of why.
I took this photo at the beginning of the month in a meeting room designed for a Microsoft employee in Redmond.
The refrigerator will call them a poster, and they'll use your company's browser. "Your browser. Our future."
In 2006, an independent survey found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the web.
Last week, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of 2010.
Microsoft is likely to be trying to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
After all, your mobile phone is increasingly functioning as a computer.
But the slide, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely ruin their business.
The Fabulous Marcel
This was worn by Pablo Picasso in the Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick's Blood diamond, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's Cross, and is also one of the underwear of the winning gay community.
And if we're already on the list of specialties, we can even raise the peaceful figure of the poor weightlifter of the wandering circus.
But what are we talking about? It's nothing more than the - typically narrow and fingerless - male cotton jersey.
I mean, the "tank", as the Anglo-Saxons call it, but a competitor like Le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles can't compete.
First of all, because of its elegant name - although among friends it is only referred to as "Marcel", which may be due to the sport, according to legend, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel’s excellent cotton fabric, Unisex customization, special emblem and the small ( barely recognizable) Belgian flag are among his competitors. The latter is worn by the most characteristic models hidden in the neck of the shirt.
But the Belgian company does not only make tank tops.
Sports tops, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, wool shorts, sea jerseys, baby clothes, mini-sorts - and we could even list - are all part of the company's products.
And they all fall into the category of comfortable underwear,
It’s also unfortunate that they need to be worn as underwear.
They're too good for that.
“I would like to be a young mother; no matter who the father is.”
He is very similar to his brother, but at the same time he has succeeded in realizing himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.
Currently, the Cruz sisters want to take a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling means far more than a few pretty and beautiful girls give their name to something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango’s new headquarters in Paris, as well as the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
Hearing warmth and mildness flows from it.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We will present Mango’s new Autumn-Tel collection, which we designed with my brother Penélope, and we will also take part in the second edition of the ‘Mango Fashion Awards’ and the gala dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
It's a pretty dense day, it's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth session at Mango. Where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the movies of the 50s and 60s; we have taken a lot from it.
And then, often I just walk around the city and pay attention to women, how they dress, how they vary and choose their clothes - this is one of my favorite time.
You work as a dancer, as an actress and as a fashion designer.
I think so too, but in the end, these three things are related, because they have a lot in common.
When I was a kid, I was interested in dresses, and I could hardly wait to go to my grandmother's dressing room and get turkey in my grandmother's closet.
Well, you were in Canaan, almost with a pair of joys.
And then as a dancer, I've always tried to pay attention to my dressing.
You know, we dancers like to figure out our own style for classes and trials to make us feel good when we look in the mirror.
And in the role of an actress, you really identify with your role when you get the badge.
You see, it's all about everything, and all my respect for the designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday, didn't you get into lethargy?
Oh, no!
I feel better than ever, I love the 30s.
I think women really get to that point, they’ve already experienced enough and make fewer mistakes in life.
The biological clock doesn’t matter.
I've been doing what I like since I was a kid, and it's filled with great inner happiness.
Do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because I was born for this, and I actually want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss that at all.
As for the future dad, it doesn't matter who he is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and with great love.
Let's just say a few words about the movie, and last year you made several movies that you haven't shown yet.
Yes, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started in the theater, am very impatient and restless, I want everything right away, but of course I know it’s impossible.
I can't wait to show you the Last Hour and the search for the tomb of Christ.
I'm curious what you say to them...
I know you made your debut on the runway with Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
Well, no, that's not true...
I didn't go out on the runway as a model.
I have known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she just invited me to a charity fashion show in London, which she organized for her own organization, Women for a better world. I chose two of my own Mango collections. The clothes presented were auctioned to her. They put her on the table and put her hands on the table.
People don't even know how kind Naomi is.
There's so much they're bringing together about it, well, I know, and I can assure you, half of it's not true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of your activity.
He asked for a noble cause for the fashion show, but if he wanted me to stand up, I'd do it.
If the fate of women living in the third world is betting, I do not know the impossible.
Drunk drivers will be obliged to install the "Alcolock"
After three drunk driving violations, the Ministry of the Interior would oblige the car to install a structure that would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver is drunk or does not inflate the structure.
The proposal was submitted in June and is currently being dealt with by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, according to which the pilot project will last for one year.
Since the project is aimed at re-introduction, the car will also have to take part in a repeated course on traffic education.
In addition to the Public Prosecutor General’s Office for Traffic Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic Safety (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Automotive Safety Technology (FITSA) participate in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of drivers who have been arrested several times for drunk driving are back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, as the system connected to the vehicle determines the level of alcohol in the inflated air. If it is higher than allowed, or if the driver does not inflate the device at all, the system will not let the car start.
The cost of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 would be a burden for the offender.
A 2007 study in the U.S. found that vehicles equipped with such equipment could reduce the number of violations by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that this rule could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure focuses on infringements for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent them from being criminalised.
On the other hand, it is easier to introduce, as the implementation of the legal reform takes place in the usual way, while the necessary criminal reform would require a constitutional amendment.
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although some industrial and public service vehicles have already been fitted in experimental mode.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which, in French terms, calls for the installation of the system in school buses.
In Mexico, In Closed Shoes
At the time announced in the program, at 17:40 a.m., the airliner of the Spanish Air Force's Asturias Herzegovina Party landed at the Presidential Hangar of the airport of Benito Juárez in Mexico City.
The sun was already setting, but it was still so hot that we could only see the royal party coming out of the plane using our hands as an eye-opener.
At the foot of the staircase stood the Spanish ambassador and other rankable figures.
A few hours before, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew if the Spanish Duchess couple were coming to visit the city.
- Well, it's not going to be an airport shuttle for a long time today...
- No, no sir, the lady is Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or something.
But the Mexican press knows everything about the Duke of Asturias and the importance of their visit.
Many are waiting on the red carpet of the airport hall, on the cordon made by the 27 Marines, who sell the protection of the dignitys.
The Prince appears, smiling, in a blue robe, and then the Princess, in the long hair of the wind, in a backdrop of clothing, but not in the usual footwear, may have been warned that Mexico City is threatened by a storm.
They stop for a moment and smile at the cameras and then enter the room where the official reception follows.
At the gate of their hotel - one of the city's four largest hotels - a reporter from one of the hundreds of television stations in Mexico is waiting for them.
The Most Valuable Fashion Award
A fashion award is undoubtedly the most suitable place in the world in Paris, and the most sophisticated and most elegant of today’s live fashion designers is undoubtedly Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second contest of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to showcase the talent of young fashion professionals internationally.
The main prize is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first bid, saw her own design clothes in the mango at 54 Haussmann Boulevard in Paris, and was saddened by her power.
By the way, it is the company’s second-largest business in Europe and recently opened at 1335 square meters.
The largest store is located in London.
In the midst of the celebrations, as well as the celebrations of Valentine's Day - which are for the presidency of the Jury - we finally met at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most acclaimed Chagalok, the presidential table made by Mango’s Gala Dinner is even more spectacular.
Nati, who had recently passed away with a heavy heart and sadness because of the death of his brother, wore a piece of the Company and some breathtaking beauty of the ELAH. Nearly two metres tall, accompanied by a son named Luis.
Andi, the owner and host of the Mango, had a lot of fun with the guests. They were so cavalry-like with Baron Rotchil that they ended up without a suit, as they were both given to one lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store with her own design pants and jeans, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. During her night opera visit to Gaya Toledo, she was so enthralled in the ballet room that her grand-fashioned old-fashioned rags and her rags were on a roll.
Inés Sastre did not take part in the palace visit, but showed her some photos of her son on his cell phone.
The next morning Oliver Martinez was able to enjoy us - he will walk two meters tall and on a motorcycle - and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental hotel in Paris. He also brought his own towels and towels, and he said well in advance that the room had no clothes.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the stress-resolved number
It's not 1000, it's 1000 and there's a way to turn off the chaotic and ugly everyday.
The good news is that we can find them all in a single book that will arrive in the bookstores on September 30 to bring you peace.
It’s almost awkward to watch at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to think about how fast-paced the world is forcing you to live every day.
The name of the office is tension, and the computer is back pain.
Stress is a popular disease of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two ways to overcome daily exhaustion and to overcome workplace problems.
No, that number is exactly equal to 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book, so that everyone can find a solution that can be tailored to their favorite and free moments.
The stress-relieving work is titled the 1001 relaxation method, and the calm flowing from it comes from the publisher of the Pearson Alhambra y DK.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the workplace or from the world of personal relationships, this handbook will certainly be stunning in your faith.
In addition, it also serves other ideas that both help to relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to prepare 100% natural foods.
If you’re already too low to refresh your adrenaline levels and become a central problem in your stress life, it’s time to sit back in your chair, relax and focus on reading.
Those who speak in their dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I don’t think of those who wake up and who are fully awake to tell what happened to them that day, but of those who talk while asleep.
The phenomenon may seem frightening at first, but it is actually completely harmless.
This is called sleep deprivation, somniloquism.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure they've told others that he was talking overnight.
In terms of its frequency, it can be completely rapszodic (for example, it occurs only once in a disease with a high fever), or more systematic (daily, weekly or monthly), and usually the next day the child does not remember anything.
Its appearance cannot be traced back to a single trigger.
Often it is associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, nighttime awakening, nighttime sleep apnea (enuresis nocturna) or sleep apnea, but this is not legal.
As mentioned above, it can be accompanied by a state of high fever, or even a stressful state or an increased state of excitement.
So far, little has been studied.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It may be loud, calm, it may consist of unrelated words, whispering, but, contrary to all of this, it may also occur in the form of screaming, crying, or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to look at the child and the specialist. The examination can reveal whether there is a problem that is causing great anxiety in the background and thereby can offer a solution.
As mentioned above, it is a benign phenomenon, consequently there is no cure unless it is accompanied by some other treatable form of sleep disorder (e.g., insomnia or stress).
However, there are a few things we can do, here’s a bunch of preventive measures:
Make sure that the child stays calm before going to bed.
We choose reassuring toys and avoid the child watching scarier or more aggressive TV shows or series.
For children who are prone to nervousness or who are more relaxed, we will teach some relaxing methods to help them find inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep more calmly.
If we start talking while we sleep, we try to keep our peace.
Remember, this is harmless to the child, and the next day they will not remember anything.
Useful Advice
Don't wake the child up.
It would be unnecessary, because the child is not conscious, but it would squeeze out of sleep.
Even though he speaks, he actually sleeps and rests.
Remember, if the phenomenon is repeatedly accompanied by severe anxiety, it is advisable to contact a specialist or discover what causes the child to become a high-level anxiety.
If you speak clearly (this is the rarest case), don’t start asking to learn anything from him.
It would be unnecessary, because while you are asleep, you are not conscious enough to gather your thoughts.
On the other hand, you only listen to the speech, but do not see the dream pictures associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of what you have heard and the possible conclusions.
Never tell your child that you can ask him about his secrets at night.
It's not even a joke.
This caused a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it’s only a few minutes of your harmless episode.
Eventually the Illhaeusern
After a long deep flight, the Illhaeusern team finally gained a new impetus and regained victory on the home run.
Although there was no damned match, the yellow-black players were put in a position several times, from which they were able to finally win one.
The pace of the game was not too tight, as the attackers were hard to feel at the right pace.
The first goal shot was attempted by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the away ball was only touching the top corner of the goal. Then the Illhaeusern came to the top of the goal, and the shots were followed by a shot: Fonderflick was shot with a shot from a distance.
On the other side, the players were protected in the middle of the block, and only the moving Riahi was in a shooting position.
The beginning of the second half was of crucial importance: Riahi and Temporale were first placed on the Dannemarie side. Immediately after that, the first goal was born: The first goal: the ball that was drawn after the first shot of the illhaeuserni Marais.
The goalkeeper of Illhausern, however, was not able to enjoy the glory for long: twelve minutes later he was forced to leave the course, so his teammates had to continue the fight in defiance of man.
The Dannemarie, on the other hand, was unable to take advantage of the advantage: they did not cause much trouble to the home team, who were just a little retreated backwards to strengthen their defenses. Only the last few seconds of the woods had some excitement.
Sarkozy meets with angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a trip to Brittany.
On Monday, a demonstration held by fishermen sparked traffic in several Breton and Norman ports, so the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère in the morning to meet with the representatives of the demonstrators.
The latter promised to welcome the president "in a constructive spirit" and expressed their abbey hope that Sarkozy would "come with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit coincides with the meeting of the "Committee of the Republic" set up by Breton fishermen with the aim of taking action against the rise in the price of gasoline, as the oil price exceeded the record price of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to President David Martinon, the president's spokesman, "will discuss with fishermen what solutions could help companies regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers."
The fishermen are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, demonstrations were held in the counties of Morbihan and Calvados, triggering roughly 10 km of traffic jams.
The transport of the ferry port of Quiberon was also cancelled, but the roads leading to the Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le were not closed.
On the Quiberon Peninsula, roadblocks were stationed.
On Monday, the sailors had already witnessed their reluctance to light tyres and blades in front of the fuel warehouses of the ports of Brest, while demonstrations took place in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other ports of the Atlantic Coast and La Manche. For example, in Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée counties, fishermen did not board the ship, while in Le Havre about twenty ships blocked the traffic of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique region, cancelled the massive oil refining blockade in Donges.
Boulogne-sur-Mer fishermen, on the other hand, have decided to wait for a meeting in the ministry to be held on Wednesday.
In Le Guilvinec, the "Crisis Committee" will have to decide on Tuesday the next step and take part in a meeting scheduled for the Paris Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the national fisheries committee, as the committee did not support their efforts.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not be allowed to leave their demands" and "will not be willing to travel to Paris", for example, said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen who do not pay tax on petrol are currently paying around 50 cents per litre, but they think that the operation of a ship would only be profitable if the price of gasoline fell below <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.30 per litre.
The Amazing Paul Newman
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid connect her unforgettable title character at home, after her 83-year-old death as a result of a cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also mocked the film legend who died at the age of 83 and committed to his profession, Paul Newman.
Embraer does not change its 2008 delivery plans
Despite the crisis threatening the world economy, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deploy 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is able to maintain its plans, and plans to deploy 215 aircraft in 2008, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, the company’s president.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer counts heavily on the Chinese market, especially in the case of aircraft with a capacity of 30-120.
Embraer has delivered a total of 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
More than 15% of AIG’s assets will be sold
American International Group, an insurance company set up by the U.S. financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets to repay <0x24>85 billion in advance, the Financial Times reported.
Aside from international life insurance and U.S. pension insurance activities, AIG would be spared a large part of almost every other business segment, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the case.
According to the Times, the AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday night to look into sales opportunities.
The AIG did not confirm this information.
The asset holdings that AIG intends to sell include International Lease Financial Corp., Transatlantic Holdings' 59% stake in the reinsurance company, and its real estate portfolio and private investments.
However, according to the newspaper, there is still no final decision on the sale.
AIG needs to get to liquid assets quickly to pay back the <0x24>85 billion loan approved by the U.S. government. With this, it assumes the risk that it will have to take up to 80% of its equity share, and that it will have an appropriate proportion of it.
Study of the Paris Historice on the historic morning meeting of the Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic downturn on Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson’s bailout plan. The Dow Jones index fell 6.98% (which has never seen a nearly 800-point drop) and the Nasdaq fell 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) declined by 777.68 points, closing 10 365.45 points.
The biggest downturn of the index to date (684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, when trade resumed following the September 11 terrorist attack.
The Nasdaq, based mainly on technology papers, was down by 199.61 points by 1,983.73 points, while the Standard & amp; Poor's 500 expanded index fell by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) by 1,106.55 points, according to official closing data.
The Wall Street stock market had already weakened at the opening, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected a banking rescue plan to restore market equilibrium, it began to deepen.
With 228 votes to no, 205 votes to no, the MEPs refused to provide the resources requested by Finance Minister Henry Paulson.
Almost two-thirds of Republicans voted against the plan.
“The market has filtered out bad signals from this because Congress seems unable to approve a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza, an analyst at FTN Financial.
"It also shows how much the market expected for this plan," he added, expressing his concern about the fact that if they accepted such a plan a few days later, it would be "too late."
“If the plan is actually put to death . . . then the Fed and other central banks will have the row to deal with the crisis and the lending conditions will continue to tighten,” Brian Bethune, Global Insight’s chief executive, said in a statement.
To further enhance the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: "every day, more and more new financial institutions go bankrupt" in the United States.
After the Washington Mutual bankruptcy on Friday, the authorities had ensured that Wachovia bank was bought by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, requiring emergency measures to save banks in the UK, the Benelux states, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market is "not only an American, but a global crisis."
The bond market has been significantly revived.
Ten-year-old runamide bond yields fell from 3.827% on Friday night to 3.632% and 30-year-olds fell from 4.357% on the previous day to 4.161%.
Obama wins the first televised duel
The first debate of the two U.S. presidential nominees was followed by another, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would win the race.
Not surprisingly, both Republican and Democratic campaigners have told themselves about the victory in the TV duel, which was watched by one-third of American households.
According to political analyst David Gergen, although John McCain’s actions were respectful, they weren’t “impressive enough” to stop the decline in popularity, according to polls conducted five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic candidate is better in the fight: according to the results of the public opinion poll published on Saturday, Obama is five-pointed ahead of McCain (44% and 49%).
Among the most predictable, still indecisive voters, 39 percent of those polled said Obama would win, while 25 percent believed McCain would win, according to a CBS poll.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his party partner Joseph Biden's promising performance on Thursday, preparing for Biden's first and only public debate with rival Sarah Palin.
Bill Clinton, however, warned this weekend: “It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
They have good feelings."
McCain, who is in his 70s, never fails to prioritize his own, undoubtedly huge foreign policy experience, while stressing his opponent's "naïveness" on the issues that were at the center of their first personal meeting.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." - the attack was repeated several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed for the presidential position,” McCain said.
This is the main attack surface, which is also used by Republican TV ads running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he represents the future.
He did not allow himself to be confused: he put it together and accurately.
He stressed that he is able to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain still doesn’t understand, but Obama already does,” a week-end Democratic announcement cut back to the Republican leader’s eye that he has not yet measured the impact of the crisis on the American “road people”.
"In ninety minutes, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said in an interview with 20,000 people who gathered in North Carolina for the election.
Not even the words "middle-class" or "workers" have been spoken in his mouth. The messy situation in the financial world is undoubtedly favouring Obama, whom the Americans consider to be the most suitable to save the bankruptcy.
"The next seven years could be a turning point," said Charles Schumer, the influential Democratic senator.
Democrat Rahm Emanuel, one of the Clinton government’s veterans, said Obama had “excellent incentives in the field of economy” as Bill Clinton did during the 1998 financial crisis.
The Democratic presidential nominee considers the current crisis to be “a final verdict on the eight-year-long bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain.”
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite the fluctuations in the stock market, it will be able to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans. He added that his primary goals include the creation of a possible energy independence of the country as a whole.
McCain plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates carefully avoided the issues that concern the <0x24>700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) bank bailout plan: the extremely unpopular plan was adopted by Congress last night.
Minszk: "Did you notice that there was an election?"
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday evening in the Belarusian capital to reject the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in Minsk’s headquarters after the closure of polling stations to protest the falsification of the election results.
Although no results have yet been published, many young people have protested against President Alexander Lukashenko with the following words: "Mr. Dictator, quit!"
Some admit that they didn’t even go to vote: “Why should I have gone? They do with my vote what they want!” says a young man.
The protesters do not believe that the regime, which sought to show itself in good colour in front of foreign observers in order to build relations with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic regime change.
If the elections were to be deemed clean by observers, they would be able to dissolve sanctions against the country, in which 40 Belarusian drivers were denied their visas and a few bank accounts were frozen.
According to the opposition, however, the elections did not take place clearly.
"We were kept away from the election committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote counting," said Yuri Potyemkin, a spokesman for the United Democratic Forces coalition from the twelve parties.
"The changes were only nominal," emphasizes Aleksandr Milinkievich, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "The essence is who counts the votes, and in this case this executive power.
If members of the opposition come to parliament, it means they have been appointed, not elected.
But their access to parliament allows them to have a seat on television, to sit in the regions of the country, and to submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore take the lead in political life, because "the dialogue with the European Union must be initiated".
In fact, if our heavily indebted economy falls into crisis with Russia and we are unable to renew it, we risk falling under Russia's authority.
But we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the results of the vote will be accepted as valid by the European Security and Cooperation Organization (OSCE), which monitors the election process.
They emphasize that the participation rate seems too high, and the wide-ranging organisation of the preliminary vote (of which 26% of the voters participated in Minsk) gave the opportunity to any manipulation.
"Did you notice that an election has taken place here?" asks Social Democrat leader Aleksandr Kozulin, who was released from prison in August this year with his second sentence, where he was held as a political prisoner.
There was no one in the polling stations.
There will be no more than five opposition delegates in the parliament, namely those who are most suited to the leadership.
In October, the silence of the night is again boiling.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission are pleased.
Blood is safe again.
The 10th anniversary of the founding of Héma-Québec was a good reason for the celebration, as Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood donors in the world today.
Most importantly, it was able to regain the trust of people, which was severely damaged by the blood-infected scandals of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the Canadian Red Cross blood supply service managed national blood reserves were infected with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general upheaval, in February 1994, the Government of Canada, led by Judge Horace Krever, initiated an official investigation to shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to make proposals for events.
While submitting Judge Krever's delayed report, some provinces set up their own committee to design a new blood treatment system for Canada.
In Québec, the Gélineau Committee has carried out this task.
The Gêlineau and Krever reports have created two blood-supply services in Canada: one is Héma-Québec, serving Quebec, and the other is the Canadian Blood-supply Company responsible for the supply of all other provinces and territories.
“When Héma-Québec started its operations in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in the Quebec blood supply system,” recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was despairing.
"In the years to come, however, we have been able to regain people's trust as a result of improving the safety of blood preparations and our work in the area." Décary proudly announces that in early 2008, nearly 94% of the population in Quebec already considered the Québec reliable.
Dr. Décary, however, does not forget that "trust is an extremely fragile thing".
Hema-Québec has been applying the precautionary principle since its founding on 28 September 1998.
During this period, a number of cases have been detected in Europe when the new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease infected people, says the doctor, who has been in charge of the company since its founding in 1998.
"We had no idea if this disease was spread through blood.
Therefore, we relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gêlineau reports. Accordingly, if we are unsure about this and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, we need to take precautionary measures. In this case, it is necessary to take precautionary measures.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not receive blood from people who have spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
A few years ago, however, all doubts were found that the disease also spreads through the bloodstream.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that allows for a much more sensitive diagnosis of the HIV virus. This is a nucleic acid test (NAT), which is able to directly detect the virus in the blood of donors, rather than antibodies that form against the virus.
Using the NAT test, we can shorten the window period, which lasts from infection until we can detect the virus in the blood using our technical tools.
This period was able to be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk of blood donors being able to infect the blood vessel was significantly reduced, as well as that it could not be detected.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of spreading AIDS through blood transfusions.
Nowadays, the risk of someone getting HIV-infected blood is 12 million for one.
"In other words, this means that we should distribute 12 million blood products while someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood preparations each year, it would take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and someone to get infected with the HIV virus through a blood preparation.
I think anyone can take it easy today, or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore health,” says the leader of Héma-Québec.
“The challenge for the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what new pathogen is being introduced into the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus, similar to the West Nile virus, appeared on the island of Reunion.
Therefore, we need to be constantly alert," said Dr. Décary, who then stressed that Héma-Québec should have sufficient permanent reserves in addition to emergency reserves.
“As the population ages, demands are also growing.
As anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the stock of blood donors, as the number of people on the network who are eligible for blood donation accounts for only 3% of the population in Quebec.
However, every healthy person at least 18 years of age who meets the fitness requirements can give blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been to a country where malaria kills are not eligible for blood donation for a year.
“With this 3%, we have enough reserves to meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare to get out of stock.
However, we need to increase the number of blood donors to the extent that the existing ones are getting older, because they can no longer donate blood after a while.
But it’s very difficult to convince people to donate blood, but it’s even harder to keep them and get them to become regular blood donors.
In today’s running world, there is hardly an hour for a man to go and donate blood.” – Francine Décary
With an annual budget of <0x24>297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood preparations but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart transplants, eyeballs and skin tissues, which are used almost exclusively in the case of individuals.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen, and then placed at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public stem bank in Quebec.
The hair is only treated as a medical waste, it is possible to obtain blood that is rich in stem cells, so it is also possible to treat serious diseases (such as leukemia).
“We celebrated a few weeks ago that the 1000th Kilduksinor blood sample was deposited in our bank, and we plan to take over a thousand new samples every year.
We are likely to start offering these for organ transplants at the beginning of next year," said Dr. Décary, who believes the cochlear implantation program is very popular nowadays.
"Many mothers are saddened that they don't have the opportunity to do this" - it is true that Hema-Québec is not able to make this complex and costly program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Football - the predecessor of the Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated the Seattle Sounders in the USL-1 scoring at 3:1 yesterday, and entered the predecessor with a total of 4:3. This was the second quarter-final and the crucial match in terms of matches.
The final goal was scored by Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half ended without a goal, in the second, the Montreal team's two midfielders, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, also scored in their opponent's net.
Roger Levesque alone from the Sounders team managed to play Matt Jordan.
Remember that on Friday's first game, Impact suffered a 2:1 defeat from the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, Seattle.
Impact plays with the Vancouver Whitecaps in the preliminary round.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, who pulled out of the Whitecaps for the first game for 3:1, won 4:3, but the Whitecaps got to the preliminary goal with a total result of 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet with the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches are still being clarified today.
Dióhey - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadians’ favorite trias are ready for the new season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostisyn led three great attacks, and finally the Canadians won against the Florida Panthers in a 3:2 penalty shootout last night at the Centre Bell.
Kostisyn, the number one star of the match, scored a goal. Plekanec two, and Kovalev closed the match with a goal, which was the fourth victory from the team's six preparatory matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who won the only goal of the shootout.
"I'm not ready yet," warns the Russian player.
"Kell another game to make me feel in good shape."
"He tried too much to get out of himself in the first third," said Guy Carbonneau.
“But I think the final result of the game is crazy.
He got a huge ovation."
Charest's Northern Strengths
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will begin this year.
When the Liberal Party meeting ended, Jean Charest had already travelled to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left) will take the lead in the midterm election today.
"To restore our last great northern border": this is an ambitious long-term goal set by Jean Charest at yesterday's meeting of the Liberal Party of Québec in Lévis. The speech was also enriched with visual elements, but at the same time, the President sought to concentrate.
During his performance, behind his back, similar pictures were taken of "Moulin à images".
The three giant publishers followed each other with stunning footage: the barriers of water plants, mining, Quebec on "Google Maps", maps...
Such spectacular tools are used in the course of election periods.
The prime minister, by the way, at the press conference, was not willing to guarantee that the election would not begin again this autumn, although he added that the timing of the election was very tight.
The "Serbia Plan" is the fourth pillar of the "vision" of Québec's future in a "new economic zone" - a labour agreement to be concluded with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and several agreements with Ontario.
Recently, the opening to the North (i.e., the north area starting at latitude 49) has often been featured in the Prime Minister's speeches, but he has never given a lecture on the subject.
However, the head of state insisted on explaining why he considered the North to be a "giant treasure" but did not talk about the time factor, the investment amounts, or the specific order of importance for future projects.
Only a few development opportunities have been identified: primarily hydropower, forestry and, in particular, mining, which is further stimulated by the growth of countries in crisis and the reconstruction of state infrastructure.
It is located in the north "with nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds," Charest said.
This is an area that is "two times the size of France", "our territory, the territory of Québec."
It’s not just in us, it’s in us,” the head of state reiterated, stressing that a national founder wants to create a myth.
He stressed that Quebec's development was largely determined by its relationship with the North: the goldfish in Abitibi, the Quebec design work, the James Bay...
"This is ours, our future!" he added, after taking a stage break and looking at the huge map behind his back.
The Northern Territory, which covers 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded for itself, the prime minister said in a press conference.
"This is our historic resolution, which has been confirmed by all governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if there is a chance, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government," he said.
On the other hand, "in the light of climate change, we need to reconsider our viewpoint on the North", the prime minister said, speaking of the northwest passage that opens every year as a result of the melting of the Arctic ice.
In the opinion of the Prime Minister, occupying the territory in this new geopolitical environment is an important task.
And what about the indigenous people of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government will pay special attention to them and that the plan will bring many benefits, especially for young people.
The two ministers of the various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was a Hungarian envoy from the Parti Québécois) have already begun negotiations with some thirty local communities.
It was also chaired by Benoît Pelletier, an inter-ministerial committee in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) played an important role.
The prime minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, “not necessarily a summit,” where they “create a common vision”.
The development of the North would, by the way, be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Nordic Plan will be coordinated, integrated and at the same time environmentally friendly," the Prime Minister said.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as consistent with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from the challenges.”
This was, by the way, one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s election as president.
One of the resolutions adopted suggests that the Beauharnois power plant be renamed by the Adelard-Godbout barrier.
"The politicians of our party, including Godbout, the founder of Hydro-Québec, Lesage, who carried out the silent revolution and the nationwide distribution of water power plants, or Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, were all aware of how to shape the future."
The press conference also cited another work, true, conservative, namely John Diefenbaker's 1957-1963 Prime Minister's program "Roads to the North".
With regard to the design of the blockade of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric power plant, President Charest stressed that the commissioning is planned for 2012.
"That stays between us, but I plan to be there," he told his followers, and his statement received a loud hurricane.
In fact, the prime minister, who even said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote to be held this fall, which the law also allows for.
However, he stressed that the agenda is now full, as he has taken on tasks at the Chinese Federal Council meeting and the Quebec-New York summit.
The party meeting held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to express nationalist resolutions, which were almost unthinkable. This is mainly about the "constitutional aspirations": the liberal party is particularly specific to the character of "Quebec".
I would also like Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and these members would have the right to veto decisions made in Quebec.
The opposition, on the other hand, was skeptical about the main points of the Northern Plan.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Paulina Marois, re-introduced the Northern Quebec development policy, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government that came to power in 2003 refused to apply this policy.
If they hadn't done it, "we'll be far ahead now," said Mrs Marois in agreement with Françoise Mercure, who was initiated as a candidate in the vote to be held in Jean-Talon today.
The ADQ supports the opposition party for the government to accept the Northern Plan.
"But we want it not to be a mere play," said party leader Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who is returning from his freedom today.
Letters - A Lost Country
Vic Toews, Harper's cabinet minister (pronounced "justice minister"), took the courage last summer to call Louise Arbour "the shame" of Canada.
To humiliate a woman who has fought for the truth all the time and deserves all our admiration - it tells a lot about the people around the Prime Minister and about himself as well as Stephen Harper.
This is our government, which, in one-quarter of the Western countries concerned, did not bring home its own citizen from the Guantánamo concentration camp.
This is a government that absolutely does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager at the time of the crimes he committed.
This is the only government that, despite Canada’s signing of the Geneva Convention, has denied its word and allowed a child’s law to run under inhumane circumstances.
The only government that makes a doll theater out of the court while investigating a defendant's crime.
Just remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International, and the Canadian Lawyers’ Association are also demanding the return of Omar Khadr to Canada for a fair trial.
And our government looks at the torture: it doesn’t matter if a young adult has already been completely destroyed spiritually, and the many years of torture have probably sealed his fate for a lifetime.
Although we are not aware of this yet, at the moment our rights, freedoms and democracy are being unduly destroyed. "Democracy": Harper constantly utters this word, which from his mouth sounds like nothing but an empty word.
The time has come when morality no longer exists: you can arbitrarily beat, torture, and imprison any Canadian citizen in the comfort of the head of a government that has been in a minority so far (and what will come after October 14th?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found by a party that glorifies the dignity, the law, and the order. They do not see that this government is representing the values to which our country has been given good news and dignity.
Dear Mr. Toews, it's a shame that you'd rather not look elsewhere.
Review - The Barrick Gold Orwelli Dictionary
In the September 17th issue of Le Devoir, a letter was issued from Patrick J. Garver, the deputy president and chief executive officer of the Canadian Barrick Gold mine.
According to Orwelli’s statement, Garver said the world’s largest gold-producing company had initiated a <0x24>6 million bribe against three authors and a small-money publishing company in order to initiate a so-called “public debate”.
While judges are independent and impartial, their decision - especially in the case of bullying - is not based on the truth, but on the law.
Not surprisingly, Garver listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
Is it really the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate to ruin anyone whose position is contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada must spend significant amounts to defend and fight in an unequal fight, where on the other hand, the army of lawyers supported by the almost inexhaustible resources of the mining industry is a state.
In such an unequal struggle, by the way, the tactics are often applied to destroy the alperes and the friendly agreement, which not only silences the opposing, but also frightens those who would try to deal with it again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views before public opinion.
While in many other countries where Barrick Gold is active, this happens differently, in Canada, the parties to the dispute usually don’t beat each other with boots, but rather share their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have had enough to open its books and records, and to prepare for a real debate in a press, media, publications, paying for independent research teams that could have shed light on the question.
But Barrick Gold doesn’t seem to trust public opinion, and with one move he misrepresents claims and letters written to protect the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can initiate a "public" debate if at the same time he takes away the opinion of this public?
In the Vice-President's mind, this word probably only refers to taxpayers, not to the whole of Canada: the meaning of the term is thus well-defined.
In a democratic state, freedom of speech is even a matter of concern to others.
Barrick Gold, on the other hand, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that Noir Canada's authors and publishers are primarily supporting the public because it condemns the mining's rough procedure.
The public is ready to listen to Barrick and make a judgment, but it would do so on the basis of civilized arguments rather than by a means of silence for many. (The term "public debate" is used, by the way, in the words of Barrick Gold, which was recently used in Canada.
Beyond Garver’s surreal scrutiny, Barrick Gold’s process launches an open attack against the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of every democratic society.
Throughout the process, he denies the right to cite credible sources, to argue about facts and their interpretation, which form the basis of spiritual activities.
If, in a country like Canada, you can study and discuss topics that do not like the wealthy companies of today’s world, who will take the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it could do so according to the scientific standards employed by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to respond.
We have been able to deal with controversies, differences of opinion and conflicts in our university environment for a long time.
Barrick Gold’s reckless procedure shows well that, contrary to his claim, there is no favour in continuing an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the public debate institution in Canada, and it is time for governments to finally put in place measures to limit legal proceedings initiated for such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue Action - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The leaders of the Bush administration and the Republican and Democratic Congress finally reached an agreement yesterday on the economic rescue action, which is the largest tailor-made plan of this kind since the Great World Economic Crisis of the 1930s.
The <0x24>700 billion plan, which aims to curb the financial crisis that has been going on in Wall Street for months, still needs to be approved by the two houses of Congress.
The main points of the plan are: more effective monitoring of implementation by the representatives; new mechanisms for ensuring the reimbursement of public funds; new provisions for keeping the number of houses occupied due to the absence of payments; access to the assistance received.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Nancy Pelosi, President of the U.S. House of Representatives, and Judd Gregg, a Republican deputy attending the hearing, announced the good news a few minutes before midnight after the two-day marathon round ended.
"We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets," said Henry Paulson, a Bush administration spokesman.
"We have done everything in our power to save the real economy and the American citizens from the current crisis that hit Wall Street," he said.
“The most important aspect is that if we don’t do this, there will be huge shocks, chaos and disturbances in Americans’ daily lives,” Republican representative Judd Gregg said in a statement.
The hearing has been accelerated over the past few hours, fearing that another failure would have a detrimental effect on the mood of investors.
The agreement was set up by the stock exchange until the opening of this morning.
The two candidates who had joined the negotiations too late were ready to reach an agreement, but they said they were not happy that the situation had improved to the very end.
Democratic senator Barack Obama has attributed himself the extension of the agreement to elements such as provisions relating to the preservation of home ownership or the payment of heads of state-held companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps because of the irresponsibility of other people, it’s not very happy.
These steps, on the other hand, are necessary," he noted on an American television show.
And when his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another channel about whether he would vote on the proposed plan, he replied, "I'd like to know the details, but I hope so."
“What I have read in large lines is already evident from the fact that it is something that we all need to digest and that we can move on.
The possibility of not doing anything is simply unacceptable,” he said.
According to the 700-billion-dollar plan, taxpayers would buy dubious claims from U.S. financial institutions, risk-exposed, unsold assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis, which was triggered by the collapse of the real estate loan. This first led to the collapse of the risky real estate loans (secondary mortgages), then spread over other loans, loans overvalued, loans overrided and traded (forfeited).
The first draft of the agreement was drafted by a group of Republican MPs last week.
It seems that we have managed to get out of this loophole since the Democrats have agreed that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficult situations are provided by the government rather than by the government.
In order for all members of Congress to be satisfied, a provision was also included in the plan, which stipulated that if the government had to bear the losses under the program for five years, it could issue new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a <0x24>250 billion detail would be paid for the first time, followed by an additional <0x24>100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The remaining <0x24>350 billion should be approved by Congress by a further vote.
In exchange for help, Washington is gaining a share in the subsidized companies, by which it receives a dividend from the profits, and which it can sell after the crisis is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the acquisition of properties to cover the mortgage loans covered by the plan. It can also limit the maximum value of the salary and final relief to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
I would like the drafters of the plan to have the plan voted on today by the House of Representatives and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, they are still not sure whether the plan will be approved.
Yesterday, anti-plan statements were repeated among both Republicans and Democrats.
"It is clear that Washington will not hear your voice," said Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee.
“Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no one that favors taxpayers.”
Brad Sherman, a Democrat who leads a small congressional group called the "skeptical faction", presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred excellent economists, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to ask Congress not to fail, and to thoroughly examine which path he chooses,” Sherman said.
In Europe at the same time, it was understood once again that this is a global crisis.
After a crisis summit, the three Benelux states announced that they would nationalize part of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion (US<0x24>16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy its rival on the brink of bankruptcy after losing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 million (2.9 billion US dollars) to the United States.
With 85,000 employees, Fortis is one of the 20 largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"It's not a waste of money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
“In exchange, we have the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly something that depositors and households now appreciate so much that the situation is promising to be uncertain.”
On the other side of La Manche, the British government seems to be preparing to state another bank, which has been devastated by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over the total amount of Bradford and Bringley bank loans, of which property loans amount to <0xC2><0xA3>41 billion (US<0x24>75.5 billion).
Spain's Santander Bank announced yesterday that it will acquire its subsidiaries and customer holdings in the UK.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalized by the British government since the crisis began.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Bye bye bye bye
The eyes of beautiful azure-blue were, according to some, the main punch card, and, according to others, the main weakness.
Have you ever been rid of a narcissistic mirror by a charming, smiling American actor?
Yeah, and no.
His shyness, his sensitivity and his innate talent also kept away from him the sleek style, which is the very existence of the great monsters of the art world.
But what a great path he has taken!
Paul Newman, 83, died of lung cancer on Friday in Connecticut, one of the last icons of the American cinema flower age.
He had less monumental personality than Brando, whom he compared, and who for a long time regarded as his accomplice in the filming. He was more depressed and undoubtedly more vulnerable in his works, but he also proclaimed freedom and the destruction of the dramatic conventions.
Often, the mixture of blood comes from exceptional children.
Newman was born in Ohio in 1925 as a child of a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
The European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic forms of the American dream.
He didn't think too much about himself, which only enhanced his worth.
The idea of a "self-made man" and the ideal of a warrior broke in the Pacific war was embodied in it. In the early 1950s, at the Yale University drama hall, and then in the movie world, in the New York City Actor's Studio, he went to the studio and studied more than before.
In addition to being a civil rights champion, he finished second in the Le Mans 24-hour race in 1979, and was considered a sex symbol, although he had been married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we can never know what the shadows of the life of this mysterious, enclosed, dedicated actor who hated the spark of show-business were. It remains a mystery forever.
He was an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s death at the end of the week shocked movie fans: in his big roles, we can only see it on the black screen of memories.
Throughout our lives, the seventh American art, cinema, has been in constant change for more than fifty years.
In our memory, the charming cowboy "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) are intertwined with the role of a young man in their 19th Tennessee Williams film "The Cat on the Hot Booth".
Recently (1990) we can recall in the image of the delicate Mr. Bridge, who faced old age with the fact that his marriage did not change his hopes.
In addition, we have seen many other faces of Paul Newman in his films.
In Robert Wise's film "Somebody's Got Away" he gave an unforgettable twist in the role of the stormy-life criminal boxer, Rocky Graziano. This was originally intended for James Dean - and he took over after his death - as a role in his actor's career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant work "The Great Left", which won an Oscar for best film in 1973.
In Robert Rossen's genius film "The swindler" (1961), he played a thrilling, vengeful billiards player, and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's film "The Color of Money".
Changing times, but always the same face: it was him.
It's always been like that.
The period of his career was marked by a change in eras.
The youngest are known mainly from George Roy Hill's 1977 cult film "Ice Breakers", where Reggie Dunlop, a team of ice hockey teams, is a trainer who works with less conventional methods.
His fans saw him in "The Great Jump" noted by the Coen brothers in 1994.
Sam Mendes' film "The Road to Damage" was released in 2003 and last appeared in the role of an Irish mafia boss.
Unlike many movie legends who left the film fairly soon, Newman remained in reflective light for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with its glowing, brightening, and hypocritical.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier did not view it as "the living chaos of underplaying" without all humour: he thought his play was too powerful.
The profession, however, was not always kind to the beautiful Paul Newman, who for a long time had just fallen into the hands of film roles.
Yet he rarely played young and successful characters: rather he formed figures living on the outskirts of society - a nervous, alcoholic, malnourished or hopeless - who were perfectly able to give back their friction and rebellion.
As a director, Newman showed a lesser-known face: a truly eye-catching and sensitive person in the depths of his soul.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (adaptation of Margaret Laurence's Canadian novel), Joanne Woodward drew a fine portrait of a melancholy woman in the lead role.
The 1984 film "Harry and his Son" is a tribute to Scott, his son who died in drug overdose with depression and sadness.
Yesterday, a number of Newman's admirers remembered the actor. His close friend and old warrior, Robert Redford (with whom they played together in "The Big Left" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids"), said of his grief and his life better.
Generosity and the joy of being: this was the secret of the vibrant personality of this great actor we have just lost.
In addition to his legendary career, he has become discouraged by his remarks about civil rights, the environment, the struggle for independent filmmaking and the dismissal of Hollywood.
We often saw her picture smiling on the packaging of sauces, sauces, cookies and other foods. She did it with a pretty bad mouthwash, though at first it was still funny.
However, revenue from such sales has always been transferred to the foundation created for children suffering from the disease.
Newman never sat on his beards: he remained committed to the profession until now.
In a letter to his five daughters, he wrote the following: "Your father has always and ever been unbelievably grateful for the lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here.”
It is also a privilege for us to have been able to accompany the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What were produced in Zuschlag & Tsai counting factory?
Soon, on October 8, the criminal proceedings against Mr. Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his comrades are charged with fraud and other crimes, including document fraud, which cause particularly significant harm to a criminal organization, consistently and commercially.
According to the prosecution, the winning bid money was used for its own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often confirmed with false accounts.
The state and municipal funds – a total of about 65 million forints – were partly transferred to the Young Left’s cash register, partly to the pockets of some people.
The method also described by the investigative authority was that the prize money obtained was collected on the basis of cost accounts that were not actually executed and the associations never fulfilled the commitment they had undertaken.
The charge says most of the bills were fake.
For these, the invoices were acquired in the market in Jozsefváros, and the circulators were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to which companies the invoice production was to take place, it fell, among other things, on the roundabout of the Balaton region to which Zuschlag János sent Lados István.
He said he had to look like a guesthouse and a restaurant.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, which was then sampled by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Social and Labour portfolio, and the Municipality of the Capital.
Most of these were noted by Lados István with his colleague, <0xC5><0x90>ri András, who, according to our information, wrote the most reports necessary for obtaining the grants.
One of Lados's "study" was a brewery.
According to two accounts issued by Zuschlagék in 2003, the guest venue provided food for the nineteen groups of the Pont Association.
However, that, according to the company manager, would not have been able to enter the guesthouse at the same time.
Similarly, the Bill for a Better Future (later Together with the Foundation for the Third Millennium) issued in the summer of 2002 was plagued by formal and content errors.
There were only three rooms in a guesthouse, more than ten people were unable to sleep in one night, and the account was about a hundred and thirty guests.
But the fanciful form-fillers were too much, even when they named Pigal Kft., which also deals with hospitality, whose accounting - according to the information given to the prosecution - was not included in the document for the Better Future and the name of Hoppá.
The head of the company, Farkas Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> told hvg.hu that when the prosecution was called and bills were shown to him, he immediately knew that it was fake documents.
“The name of our company and our tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp.”
He added that the fact that hundreds of people were accommodated in the county was also not clear beyond the formal reasons, since there were a total of eleven rooms that did not have that much access.
In addition, the bill also called for meals, while their restaurant has been out of operation for a long time.
The busy invoices were also not followed by the fact that the Budapest travel agency they looked for was organising only foreign trips, so botorul Hungary travel was designated as a service on the cash payment account, which also did not agree with the company’s invoice issuance practice.
In addition, as the investigation showed, the document also included VAT, although travel to countries outside the European Union was tax-free.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was incorrect in four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for a better future, because the company's services are not charged by the indicated VAT of 25, but 15 per cent, and the staff of the hotel only had a machine invoice.
In addition, the "suppliers" have depreciated the bill by designating a company for road freight as an activity carried out through the prosecution procedure, which the original investment advisory company did not carry out.
In addition, due to the inadequate account format, the fact that the accounts of the Third Millennium Foundation, the 21st Century Cultural Association and the Commissioner's Point are fake has also been cancelled.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Konfekhterói Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that the bills had been issued by them.
For example, the counterfeiters did not pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft. was in liquidation at the time (2001), when the Young City Association group ate there, and that is why the company was in charge of the liquidation - we knew that - we knew that
They consciously asserted
The other group of invoice issuers is made up of those who were aware that they needed to issue a fictional invoice.
The Budapest Opportunity Foundation has issued an invoice for the Third Millennium Foundation, at the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists, for about four million forints.
The head of Collab Kft. - according to the accusation - was hired by one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, to issue the fictitious account.
Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation, has also cooperated with Zuschlagé, which in 2003 sold the Foundation for a Better Future, the Association of Atlas and the Association of Red Bulls, with a gross invoice of which was not issued for 5 million HUF.
There is no movement of money, because the completed accounts have been distorted after, but the organizations have already forgotten to include this in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing the invoice is those that can be linked to the defendants.
Thus, the delivery officer of Delta Trió Ltd., the Ukrainian director of the fuel and automotive trade in Budapest, was Ivan Kubatov.
The company also issued several invoices for the sale of computing assets in October, November and December 2005, worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data of the investigation, these invoices have been purchased by the Kiskunhalasi Cash Investment Ltd., which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The company was headed by a Romanian man, to whom Iván Kubatov had also transmitted documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We know that during the investigation Kubatov acknowledged that he had issued an invoice on behalf of the company to Atlas, Hoppa and the Third Millennium Foundation together, and he took up their counterparts.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian stone farmers founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of the companies worked, which the defendant said was the reason for not getting a job.
However, he took advantage of the companies, because his defendant, the lawyer who also produced the company’s founding papers, issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov has given the organizations a total of 15 accounts worth 14.2 million forints.
The prosecution believed 10 percent of the amounts on the bills and the VAT hit the Kubatov mark.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictional invoices, which were manufactured for the application of Securities Point.
The Y-Generation and the Association submitted an application for Modern Hungary in January 2006 for the public-profit organization of the Socialist Party, the Táncsics Mihály Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500,000 to 500,000 forints, but the amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To avoid this, five fictional accounts received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These bills were found, by the way, during a home search in Kemetsei <0xC3><0x81>rpád’s office at the educational wallet.
At the trial, some of the defendants, as did the prosecutor's office, are likely to report the proceeding of the invoice.
Most interestingly, if you are the first-rate defendant, Zuschlag János decides to appeal to the court.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is for this purpose that the Socialists have made a deal with him, after a large part of the damage, for fifty million forints in return, and Zusi takes the plunder.
By the way, even today, he may have been hurt, as his requests for alleviation of the circumstances of his detention, i.e. for his placement in domestic detention, were constantly deaf to the ears.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes which cause much more harm and do not cause it, may walk freely, or at least wait in their own home for the end of the proceedings against them, he has no opportunity to do so.
The Psychology of Overlying: Why We Spend More Money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overvalue the goods.
The neuro-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior have been able to be discovered by neuroscientists and economists at the University of New York.
According to a study published in the journal Science, people don’t want to be in a competition like eBay’s auction, so they’re paying too high a price.
The research attempted to map the nervous system schema of this "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers lottered, the other group participated in the auction of players, while the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method examined the active brain regions of the subjects.
Participants were able to earn money in both games, but during the auction game - in which an essential element is the overindulgence of the other party - the complex called the striatum, under the cervical cortex, went into intensive operation at the time of loss of the game.
This area of the brain plays a role in the "self-supporting" mechanism of the nervous system among several other functions.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the increase in price can be explained by avoiding the heavy reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the members of the research group of economists also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this case, three groups have auctioned against a partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product in question, and they made their bets.
In addition, another group was promised that if they were eliminated from the game, they would receive another <0x24>15 in rewards.
The third group, on the other hand, received <0x24>15 just before the auction, but in the event of a losing auction, the members of the group also lost that money.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, only that one of them emphasized the winning and the other the loss.
Proving the neurologists’ hypothesis, however, members of the team playing against losses were willing to bet higher than the control and the winning group.
“These results cannot be derived from any theory of the economy that existed in the past.
In fact, so far, they have explained only with the joy of winning and the avoidance of risk the phenomena experienced at the auction.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories by coming to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of death.
The number of people with hepatitis at home can be set to one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is the reason: patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the collection name of infectious liver pathways caused by various viruses.
Their lungs have many similarities, characteristic of hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms, depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the feeding channel (for example, with food, water infected), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body moisture (poison, vaginal discharge).
Travelers should definitely be protected against A and B viruses, there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, usually accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal complaint, nausea.
After these, yellowing on the skin and white of the eyes develops, the stool becomes clear, the urine becomes dark, and healing can take two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people worldwide die of the most severe type of the disease, hepatitis B-induced liver cancer and liver fat.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten people who are infected will receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to liver constriction and liver cancers.
Most infected people don’t even know about their disease, because the pathogen subcutaneously destroys the cells of the liver, in many cases the first symptoms appear only after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prematurely prevent and to carry out regular screening tests.
In three groups, such diseases are far more than the average: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users, and tattooists.
The number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is currently 200 million.
Since the disease can already be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is worth consulting a pharmacist if any symptoms of unknown origin are detected.
With the recognition of time, the disease can be cured, the virus can be removed from the body, thus eliminating the infectious ability and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients around the world.
It aims to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Who believes in God hurts less?
According to a recent study, religious faith acts as a kind of painkiller, which has already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how God-believing influences people’s sense of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of the rather bizarre study, 12 Catholics and the same atheists were given electrosocs, while all of them studied a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholics were able to exclude much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of detecting the human brain, it also turned out that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain that is responsible for regulating the pain.
The study is the first in a research series in which academics, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university also participate.
The test was carried out precisely by a sparkling device reinforced to the left hand of the experimental subject who provided the electroshock.
The researchers asked participants to look closely at two paintings, the 17th-century painting of the Virgin Mary by Sassoferrato and the 15th-century painting of Leonardo da Vinci by Mrs. Hermelin.
The authors of the study hoped that the vision of the Virgin Mary would give rise to a sort of religious state among believers, while the da Vinci image was chosen because it was not too different from the other and was thought to have a soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner machine, during which time they received 20 electrochokes in four consecutive parts, while watching either a religious theme or a general picture.
The Catholics reported that during the vision of the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" as if they were "consoled" and "dismayed, filled with peace".
While viewing the religious-themed image, they reported 12 percent less pain than when they saw Leonardo’s creation before them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, even among atheists, only the right photo should be found.
“We should find an image that feels very positive about, like a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
The Bishop of England, Tom Wright, welcomed the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should, and in many cases, change our personality,” Wright added.
After the great results, the only question is, if Leonardo, or a painter of a similar caliber, showed the image of a widow to believers, what effect would it have on their pain regulation?
Would the quality of the Virgin Mary’s vision be even better?
You are what you share about yourself
On your 10th birthday, Google can tell you: it’s in people’s pockets at least as much as it’s in the sky; you know where they’ve been on vacation, what sorts they’re going to do, and what they’re interested in.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s chief executives.
As for the skeptics who are paralleling the orwellian image, they do not see the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about its users, and that's necessary to keep them to the original purpose of Google founders' information, which was summarized in their system.
According to a spokesman for Google, even after ten years of world-renowned work, the company is only at the beginning to be able to handle all the information.
To the question of what will happen in five years, Schmidt answered: he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would really be right for me?" - but until then, the software wouldn't be able to answer, they wouldn't dare to say that.
Not all Internet users are aware of the fact that search terms are precisely recorded during internet searches, which IP address they were searched for and which page the interested parties went to after the search.
With our Personalized Search started two years ago, users can store their own browsing background history, get back to what they were looking for, click on what they were clicking on, and through it, they will find our products in the long term, and they will be able to generate more personalized results from our products.
What if my data is being used against me, if they look at what I'm dealing with? - ask users who are worried about seeing the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, the degree of potential power represented by the company can be scary, not your guilt, fear of punishment, a desire for freedom, and then a rebellion against power triggers the counter-reactions in Internet users.
However, the fact that all the sought expressions are not only recorded, but can be transferred to a third party if justified, in such legal cases nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
Perhaps the most recent example of this was a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information about the pedophiles from the Orkut community website, which it held.
In May, however, Internet users concerned about personal rights were able to sneak up when the company successfully proved to be true in court with the EFF against the FBI, saying that Google is not going to be forced to make a lawsuit against the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought out about 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it won with a reference to enforcing the Child Protection Act, which had been adopted years earlier, but it would not have been able to obtain a full list of them, and would not have been able to obtain them.
So Google’s opinion is quite contradictory: those who hold back from entering their personal data are being distracted because they feel their privacy and privacy are swirling by starting to use Google’s services and being exposed to multi-companies that appear in their conservative imagery.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiasm for computer fans, activists, and users is squeezing into the next generation of big corporations, all for being a "meaningful corporation" in them, as opposed to being a rival to the world of Windows.
This may be because Google doesn’t ask for user identification code in a different way than Microsoft, it doesn’t ask for money for its applications, the open, free, constantly updated source code and program package is much more accessible, younger, cooler than the age.
However, it can also happen because the Geeks are accurately exploring the very problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which is one of the most widely spoken keywords in recent years, Web 2.0 is pulling after itself.
In fact, web 2.0 is nothing but collaboration, about intentionally leaving traces of ourselves and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal, and while the extent of these changes individually, the essence is the same: we show ourselves.
An average young person can also have profiles on multiple social sites from Facebook to Xangai, link them to other services such as Twitter, or with last.fm listing their music habits, and then insert them into any tracking systems that can be used to track them down, such as “FriendFeed” or “FriendFeed”.
While we can read a number of examples of cases that reveal: the girlfriend easily realizes by seeing the morning photo pairing of a common circle of friends that her cheating friend has spent the night with her, or she can fire an employee of a company for one reason only because her blog is hers.
The person who lives online is made up of what he shows from himself, with which we can describe the basics behind the behavior of today’s young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something, or at least want to avoid the Google monopoly, can do so (e.g., starting with Scroogle, who is using Google’s search engine, but at the same time deliberately left no mark).
For example, the number of people who don’t intend to register on social pages to prevent them from appearing, Google’s online applications from text editors to image managers and advertisers can be replaced with alternative versions that don’t link to your profiles.
Public opinion isn’t so secretly waiting for Google to show off tooth protein.
The company is currently worth more than <0x24>156 billion worth of timber than IBM (<0x24>140 billion), Intel (<0x24>124 billion) or Coca-Cola (<0x24>110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms, and ad revenues from other advertising agencies.
In 2006, however, the critical viewers found that Google found all the opposing points to their concerns: for example, the top management completely rejected the objections of its employees, having doubled the amount of the company’s fee, found it too expensive, and the company found it too expensive.
One of the company’s internal rules is that they should not advertise a new service in advance, only when it is already available, but the problems that we can see in the months and years to come can move the world to a new point: some people think that it’s going to be a project, a book and a magazine.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database can also provide a good foundation for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the popular novel by Cory Doctorow, Scroogled point orwell describes the future in which a person can only be alarmed by Google’s data.
Two teenage boys helped the ozdi double killer in the crackdown
Two youths have been interrogated by the police in the case of the double murder in Ozdi and are believed to have been helping to eradicate traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod county police chief said on Tuesday.
The young people have been recognized for their crimes, and they are currently being accused of committing crimes.
The two young men - two girls according to the MTI - defend themselves freely.
Criminal separation can also be punishable by a loss of liberty of up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
Pre-planned, for profit, suspected of a crime of murder of several people.
The investigation found that the 23-year-old belonged to a larger sum than a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off his debt, so he cheated on his creditor at an odd estate last Wednesday, where he ended up with him and the man's 9-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the young man was prepared in advance to commit the crime, which is a sign that he committed the murder with a gun thrown on the spot.
The circumstances of the weapon and its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers to Accept the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros – about five billion Czech crowns – were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the acquisition of the 100 percent shareholding package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer, which was made by the Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously excluded by the Czechs from potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in state hands.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60% of the papers in a few months’ time.
The Czech economic daily E15 knows that the Polish offer is the highest amount that the interested parties have so far offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Varsovia Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner among the interested parties, and did not rule out that this could lead to the end of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated at 5-10 billion kroner by market experts.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, about 90 percent of the securities could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with approximately 25 per cent share, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 per cent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
From the perspective of the European Journals on the Financial Crisis
In their comments on Tuesday's deepening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers are already referring to "Second September 11".
The global financial disaster can be attributed to the U.S. president - accused by the Roman La Repubblica - the president has not yet been able to uproot his own party in his wound, a draft law that has been put together in the back of a questionable situation.
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it’s worth talking about September 11th.
A part of the Madrid press is also seeing the culprit in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has put the world economy on the brink of collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is increasing, and then the whole world will suffer from it.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, the congressional vote threatens Washington not to offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air – just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, according to the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Today, some states are still able to provide bailouts to supporting financial institutions, and with taxpayers’ money they can save them from bankruptcy.
But if even more banks merge like dominoes, then neither the funds nor new instants will be enough.
In the long run, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their own national ego and to centralise control over the fragmented money markets.
The financial institutions received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion on Monday alone, according to the Vienna Der Standard, which says concerns are becoming more and more realistic that European taxpayers, like the Americans, need to get deep into their pockets in order to become wealthy.
The EU has so far not taken seriously the crisis, which as a tsunami has continued throughout the old continent.
Rescuers don't have to borrow hundreds of billions of euros soon, but it would be good if they did: in which case it would be reasonable to use taxpayers' money to prevent major damage.
The flight of the dong is imitated by the smart car
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid collisions if it weren’t for imitation of obstacle sensors in the natural world?
Bees, for example.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the dong bees gave Nissan engineers a strategic starting point in how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C, a two-wheeled car robotic control system, a robotic mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate purpose of designing a system that will help to prevent it from developing.
During flight, each bee forms its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety protective bucket - explained Kazuhhiro Doi, Technology PR and R&D Brand Director at the exhibition.
The role of the complex eye of the uterus is important, which can be seen at a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions.
To copy the complex function of the eye, the engineers came up with the idea of laser telemetry.
This detects obstacles within a distance of 2 meters before 180 degrees before the BR23C, calculates their distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns into a collision avoidance operation.
During the fraction of a second, the obstacle is detected, and then the car robot, following the movements of the uterus, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to avoid collision.
In any way that is different from the current system, this avoidance maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If it weren’t, the car robot wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, the head of the car robot project at the Mobility Laboratory.
It must react in a stimulating manner and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner layer of the safety shields, a layer within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does in order to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in a single click of an eye.
But, unlike bees, the deviation cannot be directed upwards, downwards, or transversely, it can be only two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the wheels’ reversibility.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibility available to bees to escape other bees, only rotary motion and acceleration, as well as the slowdown, were applied as an option available to the car robot.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have higher energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion variables.
According to Andoh, an instinctive intelligent response is an important, not the ability to process data, even less the ability to store it.
This structure needs to process only a few incoming signals every second and respond to them.
There’s no need to preserve them and respond with intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres, so you’re constantly using only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There is no need for gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of a technology for immediate avoidance, which Nissan estimates could be involved in series-produced cars within ten years.
It may be possible to integrate the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to drive the car to the specified destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
It is also a name for a poisonous child.
A written version of the <0x24>700 billion economic bailout law aimed at the purchase of banks’ bad loans has been prepared in more detail.
First of all, half of the money is spent.
According to the East Coast time, more talks between Saturday and midnight have reached the congressional leaders’ headlines in a debate over the <0x24>700 billion bailout package, which has been going on for days.
"We have made a lot of progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the president of the U.S. House of Representatives, a Democrat, who said the deal had only been put on paper.
The compromise from the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said on the outcome of the compromise: the programme will work and be effective, but there is a need for further action. Pelosi believes that this is not about saving Wall Street, it is about reversing the slope of the economy.
The written version of the package was made public before the opening of the Asian markets in Washington on Sunday night at 8 p.m. (i.e. at 2 a.m. on Monday) but did not cause a spectacular burst on the stock market.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the draft law on the 2008 Economic Deterioration Stabilisation Act, which will take place in the House of Representatives, and then the row will be in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our monetary markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program, by the way, differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal that the <0x24>700 billion would have been spent simultaneously on the purchase of poor-quality, loan-backed securities.
In the first place, up to half of the amount of 700 billion can be spent using 250 billion immediately after Congress is expected to vote on the case on Monday, from which the Ministry of Finance will re-purchase up to 100-million-dollar securities with a bad rating credit.
The program will be supervised by a separate body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The cost of the other <0x24>700 billion depends on a further resolution of Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: you can buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage securities at the same time, as well as other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase can be made within the framework of auctions and directly - the Ministry's officials said.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to take part in an insurance scheme where the financial portfolio guarantees the means that cause concern, for which companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the necessary assets to reach up to <0x24>700 billion to the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether for the purchase of a broad range of bad assets, whether for the insurance of their own, or for the insurance of their own funds.
“We will take the necessary steps to be ready for the law as soon as it is signed,” he added.
Heads of state-held banks who are in trouble and awaiting state aid, however, can expect the government to limit their exit money – which the overseas slang simply calls a golden umbrella.
The limitation of payments is only in certain cases, and the limitations depend on the way in which the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
In essence, the restriction means that if you buy from the Ministry at auction, you will be charged an extra fee to the gold parachute unless you send it to a pension for the levied bank note.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the management’s money is not exaggerated.
The image includes that the existing gold umbrella contracts do not change, the restriction applies only to new ones to encourage participation in the program in this way.
This is the first time in U.S. history that there will be legal restrictions on the remuneration of CEOs, said Barney Frank, chairman of the House's Financial Services Committee.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the state acquires the right to acquire shares, so that the risk of taxpayers is reduced, as they can ultimately win on the transaction as soon as the economy and the saved bank are settled together.
The bill states that over the next five years, the president will have to submit a proposal to Congress that will provide how taxpayers can be reimbursed the expected losses from the financial sector.
There were, of course, people on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
“This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, that is, it does not protect the dollars of taxpayers,” said California Republican Darrell Issa.
Mary Kaptur, a Democrat in Ohio, said the measures were called for by the same people who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise.
In August 2008, the industry’s domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month, up by 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007, according to KSH news.
The prices of industrial export sales were 1,1 per cent higher than in July 2008 and decreased by 3,9 per cent compared to a year earlier.
As a result of the domestic and export price changes, industrial producer prices were 0.7 per cent higher than in the previous month and 3.2 per cent higher than a year earlier.
The industry's domestic sales prices have only increased slightly compared to the previous month, up 0.1 per cent.
The domestic sales prices of the manufacturing sectors also rose slightly, up by 0.1 per cent from July.
In August 2008, the largest shadow growth occurred in the leather products and footwear industry (2.8 per cent), mainly in the production of handbags, strips, and footwear, respectively, 4.6 per cent.
The increase in the price of plastics and chemical raw materials resulted in a monthly increase in the prices of chemicals and products in the manufacturing sector (1.6%).
Prices decreased in oil processing (1.4 per cent), electrical machinery, instrument manufacturing (0.9 per cent), and - to a minimum - wood processing (0.1 per cent) sectors.
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the rest of the manufacturing industry, we measured a price increase between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In August, prices in the electricity, gas, gas and water sectors, representing a significant weight in the domestic sales of the industry, increased by 0.3%, mainly as a result of the delayed impact of the government’s increase in gas from 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison - in terms of the domestic sales of the processing industries - the oil-processing industry has seen the highest increase in prices (32.4 per cent).
The production of metal-processing products in the industry was 13.2 per cent, with a price increase of 11 per cent in the food, beverage and tobacco industry.
Prices decreased in textiles, textiles (2.5%) and electrical machinery and instruments (0.3%) sectors.
In the rest of the manufacturing industry, the rate of price increases ranged from 0.6 per cent to 9.1 per cent.
The entire manufacturing industry has increased prices by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water sectors were 18.7 per cent higher than a year earlier.
In August, the largest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was seen in the domestic sales of the targeted groups of sectors in the investment goods-producing sectors.
Consumption-producing sectors increased by 0.3%, while energy-producing and further-use sectors remained unchanged compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the highest price increases were observed in the energy and further consumption sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, we have seen a 6.8 per cent increase in prices and a 1.4 per cent drop in investment goods.
The export prices of the industry in forints increased by 1.1 per cent compared to the previous month in August, a decrease of 3.9 per cent compared to 12 months.
Our domestic payment instrument declined by 1.7 per cent against the euro in one month, 7.1 per cent against the dollar, compared to 7.5 per cent against the euro in August 2007, and 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Do I need a visa for the United States next year?
Göncz Kinga sees a good chance that around January 12 the U.S.-Hungarian visa-free agreement will come into force - the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago before the local Hungarian leaders.
In his opinion, "it all depends on whether the electronic input and control system is being developed overseas in time."
At the same time, he pointed out that the new system will not have an entry permit, but tourists will have to register themselves before they leave.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy is now negotiating in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom the Central Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary will hand over the Star Award and hold discussions with the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are on the sidelines of the bank bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two major U.S. presidential candidates, secured on Sunday the government’s <0x24>700 billion bailout package, but there is a politician who is demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
After marathon talks that have been held since the days of Congress and administration, they announced on Sunday morning that they had signed a principle agreement on the bank bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis and the bankruptcy of the frozen credit market have become a central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain also pointed out that they are better suited to pushing the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, by evading economic issues, Obama once again gained some advantage, dissolving McCain’s advantage, which he gained after the Republican convention with the appointment of Vice President Sarah Palin.
At a Detroit campaign meeting on Sunday, Obama expressed his hopes that the 700 billion package bill will be passed by Congress quickly.
He stressed that the proposal includes those consumer protection passports, which he also supported.
"Now we have to act responsibly (...) threatening your position, your savings, your entire industries, the stability of the economy as a whole," he said.
He did not neglect to call McCain’s economic ideas past.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We will all find it difficult to swallow it (...) but doing nothing is simply not a path."
The Republican senator said the proposal included the establishment of the Finance Minister’s Supervisory Committee and the limitation of the ultimate relief of top leaders, he insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a decent role in the negotiations, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill on Monday.
Map of the German-speaking area
The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp the voters became more self-aware - so Der Spiegel analyzes the CSU’s weak role in Bavaria.
Haiderek is ready for the Austrian government to prevent the Red-Black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German left-wing newspaper Franz Walter, the Bavarian Revolution reveals the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in an article entitled “Fathers and Parents”.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
The Christian Socialists have re-established Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The era change is a Christian democracy as a whole, and so is Angela Merkel’s problem.
The failure was not quite surprising for the CSU, but it ended Sunday with a process that was almost exactly ten years ago likely: the undisputed hegemony of a couple of states disappeared.
For ten years, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time in its fifty years below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag election, which was even mentioned in the Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the continuously implemented modernization by the CSU in the province, which will discourage its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have made a lot of mistakes at the pace. However, it could not have been without the loyalty of the voters to the CSU, the secularization of education results and the entry of the East and North Germans into the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this can also be seen.
The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp, the voters became more self-aware, more critical, more self-centered.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, the classical civil groups have been mostly away from the CSU; they are freelance workers, industrialists, graduates and graduates.
The CSU’s support has been reduced to less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The article in the conservative Vienna newspaper, "Who, with whom? The presidents of the parties in the retracted coalition issues" deals with the confusing internal political situation that emerged after the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its interiors.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens do not yet want to negotiate the coalition.
The election took place, now it all revolves around the coalition; in a public-service television debate, the party leaders barely allowed an insight into their cards.
Werner Faymann, SP<0xC3><0x96> President, confirmed his intention to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that it is possible for the two parties to cooperate - in some areas and in the social partnership.
The question of whether you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - with the current <0xC3><0x96>VP president as well as with Chancellor - was left open by Faymann.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer course has been cancelled anyway.
There is no question of repeating this trend.
Molterer responded cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, co-operation will certainly not be effective if Faymann attempts to intervene within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether a party elects the opposition or joins the coalition, which is currently fully open in the party, the issues must be discussed within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
President Jörg Haider BZ<0xC3><0x96> once again appeared open in all directions.
“To prevent the Red-Black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibility,” Haider said.
It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
The European Summit on Equality of Opportunities, which this year is hosted by France, the European Union's leading presidency, has begun today in Paris.
Járóka Lívia, a representative of the European People’s Party, called attention to the education segregation in her message to the plenary as one of the main speakers of the professional consultations, because it is one of the most serious violations of the law against Roma children.
The high-level conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - was opened by Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The consultation included representatives of governments, European social partners and the most prominent European legal defenders and civil organisations in the area of equality of opportunity.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz EP representatives - warned that, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, Roma are primarily forced out of the labour market due to their low schooling.
"The overwhelming majority of Roma youth do not have a secondary education, and as a result of poor basic education, only a small proportion of them can obtain a higher education."
He also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education plays a key role in enforcing other human rights.
Investing in early education of Roma children can strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
The honourable Member believes that it is necessary to raise awareness of these connections in the broadest sense, including between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the sooner a Roma student starts school, the more likely they are to become productive members of the labour market; they contribute to the national budget through taxes paid after income and consumption.
"Romanians must ensure their right to quality education by the right of their EU citizenship and guarantee the abolition of their low-quality and segregated education," said Járóka Lívia.
The rapporteur believes it is necessary to combine the European Union's objective and action-oriented approach to accelerate the school disaggregation processes immediately, and to this end it is essential to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly observed.
"While it is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, Roma children must be given the opportunities given to the democratic space to contribute as a full-fledged citizen to the future of Europe," Jaróka said.
The European Equal Opportunity Summit, held annually since last year’s meeting in Berlin, aims to provide a unique forum for the achievement of equality and equality of opportunity at European and national level.
CSU: Mercy for a Transitional Time
At the end of October, the duo of Huber-Beckstein will decide
Despite the sweeping fall of the election, the heads have not yet died, and the discussion of personal issues has been delayed at the summits of the CSU in Bavaria.
Erwin Huber and Günther Beckstein, the provincial head of government, can still remain in his place, the question of how long will grace last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffers a catastrophic loss of 17%, will be decided by an extraordinary party congress last weekend in October.
In any case, the members of the highly condemned couple felt that they did not stick with all their strength to their chair.
In this way, they tried to discourage angry members of the faction and the base who, one day after the "best tsunami", demanded personal consent for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, with Edmund Stoiber still at the forefront of his career, the Christian Social Union gained 60.7 percent, but now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, it ran only 43.4 percent of its strength.
For 46 years, the CSU has been a "separate party" in Bavaria, which accounts for 18 per cent of German GDP.
While the conservatives continue to count on high in the key southern region of Hungary, they will certainly be forced to coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of a reorganization within the party, the Vice President and Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer, who expects Huber’s possible successor, will also receive a place in the narrow exploration team, which is part of the liberal FDP and part of the Wátní <0xC5><0x81>ód<0xC5><0xBA> <0xC5><0x81>ód<0xC5><0xBA>.
The curious fate is that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein couple as a chance for a coup, was put on the list of Free Electors, and then he was reluctantly overthrown by the self-governing political party.
The CSU leaders are now turning all their energy into stabilizing Beckstein in some way.
In the transition, Stoiber, who has so far woven the threads from the background, will play an active role, calling September 28 the worst day of the political career of the former head of state and former CSU president.
Huber on Monday added some skeptic remarks to the CDU, saying they would have deserved much more support from the brotherhood.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the September 2009 Bundestag election, Merkel will not be a chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the country in 2005, is somehow re-established as a joint force.
Merkel, who is very disappointed by the failure, said the CSU’s land loss would not have a negative impact on the Berlin coalition.
What is relative, of course, is that the injured CSU will not be easier to handle, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
The SPD achieved its weakest score in Bavaria with 18.6 percent since 1946.
Lukasenko opposition: 110-0
None of the opposition members entered the Belarusian parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this is due to the well-being and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the European Security and Cooperation Organization (ESCB), the irregularities committed during the counting of votes.
The ESCB, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the 10-million-member legislation has been lacking in the opposition for many decades, the United Democratic Forces (U.S.S.S.) unified opposition in the run-up to yesterday's elections has been seriously hoped that the parliamentary amendment will be "refused" in response to the 2006 constitutional amendment.
In this way, the ODSZ has also stopped the boycott previously considered.
Against the backdrop of opposition expectations, Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, has become more and more dependent on Russia - which has borrowed from Russia's constantly expensive natural gas imports to moderate and contributed to the EU's policy of gas pipelines and gas pipelines, and has also been the owner of the Beltran.
He noted in advance that when assessing the election campaign, the EESC placed emphasis on positive movements rather than on shortcomings - for example, banning a third of the opposition candidates from starting.
However, the OSCE’s early report on Monday already objected to the campaign – during which opposition nominees were essentially not allowed to appear in the press – and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the counting of the votes.
At the same time, the opposition believes that there is a significant improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to face a smaller confrontation with Moscow, still denying the recognition of an area of South Ossetia and Abkhazia that is separating from Georgia.
"We have taken two steps forward, one backwards, but the most important thing is that dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Mr Milinkevic told the newspaper.
The opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election said it would be desirable to keep this going, despite the fact that “the power was afraid of letting even one opposition enter the weightless parliament.”
In view of the results, the opposition is not planning protests, but rather trying to deliver a message about the need for economic reforms to the voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print the opposition sheets in Russia, there are obstacles to the spread by the local authorities, but I also see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly," Milinkevich said, referring to his age.
“The country’s debt, the increase in the trade deficit, is a matter of time for the breakdown of social security that is “causing the graveyard’s silence,” Milinkevic said.
Against the opposition politician, the Russian observers described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebegyev, head of the Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novoszty: "People believe not in words, but in actions", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than the maturity of the Belarusian electorate.
Brunetta: "Breakfast only before work hours"
In the history of the Chigi Palace, rotary doors have been installed in a unique way for workers to get out and enter.
This new measure comes into force today against prosecutors, to filter out those who block and then go for a coffee during work hours.
Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Prime Minister’s Office, presented the news today.
"The turning point," said Brunetta, "is to do better and more efficient work, reduce shortages and increase services."
"A new, more responsible and more transparent period is coming.
This is a real reform," Brunetta said.
The Chigi Palace will complete the renovation of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
According to Masi, "the installation of the rotary gate is also important from a symbolic point of view".
We did not experience any resistance on the part of the employees - the Secretary-General confirmed: "The workers put the measure in place, everyone cooperated."
In other words, the morning lighting is over, there is no more coffee and spices.
Brunetta smiled and advised: "A good little cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning, it can do wonders."
the Roman Faculty of Public Administration
The minister said: “In three months, the shortage of workers in the public sector has decreased by 50 per cent due to disease, which means more than 60,000 workers in one year.”
At the same time, he added that the Italian administration should be made more efficient.
“The salary dynamics, according to the minister, have been twice as high in the last 8-10 years as in the private sector, and well above the inflation rate.”
At the same time, thousands of public servants gathered together, joining an intervention supported by the Italian Environmental and Consumer Protection Associations to object to the provisions of the Brunetta Regulation.
"While the administration minister is proud of data supporting the reduction of shortcomings due to the disease, the war of 'unfathomable sunspots' is steadily growing," the Consumer Protection Association writes.
"Italy has gathered thousands of honest and hard-working public officials across the country to send war on the illegal regulations of the regulation."
The Regional Administrative Court, among other things, appeals to the abolition of the supplementary allowance for illnesses due to serviceable reasons, the extension of the period of residence of the sick leave workers at home, which may include a period of more than one year and a period of more than one year.
Workplace accidents: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything
Every day in Italy, 2,500 workplace accidents result in 3 deaths and 27 permanent disabilities.
According to the workplace accident insurance, in 2007 there were nearly 1,200 deaths in the workplace.
The numbers show the severity of a phenomenon, which is still one of the most common causes of death today, and requires almost twice as many victims as murder.
Today, for the 58th time, Anmil organizes the Day of the Victims of Work Accidents in all the regions of Italy, traditionally held on the second Sunday of October, to draw the attention of institutions, social organizations and mass communication to this dramatic problem.
“The worrying data released by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, support the fact that prevention plays an extremely important role in workplace accidents,” said Giorgio Napolitano, President of the Republic, Pietro Mercandelli, in a press release.
The head of state sincerely commended "the unity's persistent commitment to the prevention of work at work, the protection of the interests of workers suffering from accidents, the assistance of the families of the victims and the acceptance of public opinion".
“There are natural and sincerely shared outrages inflicted by tragedies of this nature, from their dimensions, which also arouse the interest of the media and the public, but in reality we are faced with dramatic, repeated and repeated cases every day.”
Napolitano openly admits: “We are undoubtedly struggling with resource deficits, the financing of education and information is crucial.
Initiatives within the school are of particular importance aimed at direct clarification of young people who are on the brink of entry into the world of work.
It is our duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to let attention be drawn to the social importance of the issue, and we need more effective legislation, which needs to be enforced.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the House of Commons, stressed that "the seriousness of the workplace accidents that result in death is socially important for all of us, and the institutions are required to do so as soon as possible".
“The data on workplace accidents show a slight improvement, but the number of such deaths is still incredibly high,” said Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
“We don’t want this declining tendency to be paired with declining attention, because it’s when the biggest tragedies happen.”
“We believe that, at a general level, we are still not doing everything we can to overcome the phenomenon that could be solved through a complex action programme.
In our view, stricter supervision and control would be needed, Mercandelli stressed, as well as more significant intervention in the field of workforce training, starting from school education."
"There is also a need for further efforts to inform and make the public aware," he added.
What is needed most, however, is a more responsible employer environment in the face of a phenomenon that is a social problem.”
Afterwards, Mercandelli condemned "the gradual deterioration of the protective network for the victims of occupational accidents" as well as "the direction of assistance towards which the system has drifted in recent years."
“The goal is to give workers back the security provided by the insurance, because the fate of those affected by the accident cannot depend on where the lawmakers are arbitrary and where the distributor’s actions.”
Hearing losses can be caused by MP3 players
Increasing hearing loss can be caused by hearing loss on portable players for longer periods of time and listening at high volume, such as MP3 devices -
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the Scientific Committee on New and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) made a public opinion today.
“The expert’s opinion shows that 5-10 percent of those who listen to their portable music player at a high volume for more than an hour a day for five years may suffer from persistent hearing impairment,” the statement reads.
"It is worrying that young people who use mass and frequent high-volume portable music players and mobile phones are unaware that they can irreversibly damage their hearing," said Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific surveys indicate an undeniable risk, to which we must respond urgently," the EU Commissioner added.
The most important task is to inform consumers and to disseminate the information in this regard widely.
In the light of the above-mentioned expert opinion, we must also review existing control systems so that they can operate efficiently and keep up to date with the latest technologies."
In Brussels, he called on the Independent Scientific Committee to investigate the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise they cause.
"The researchers confirm our concern, and the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine what possible measures could be introduced in order to ensure that portable players and similar devices are connected to them," he said.
The current European safety regulation sets at 100 dB the maximum level of noise emitted by portable music players, however, increasing concern is accompanied by data damage caused by the excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as a reduction in the level and duration of noise, through which these hearing losses can be significantly reduced.
According to an expert opinion of the EU Scientific Committee, for those who listen to music with a high volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week, noise levels exceed the maximum level of noise in the workplace.
If a person listens to music for a longer period of time under similar conditions, there is a risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This portable device affects about 5-10 percent of users, which could account for 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno sets up committee responsible for the future of the capital
It starts today, until March, and the results are expected in June.
This schedule was set out by the City Council for the operation of a committee called "The Future of the City of Rome", which met this morning at the new headquarters behind the Caracalla baths.
In the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the Rome directives.
After the end of March, the study and plans will be evaluated in the General Assembly and in the Municipal Committee to be submitted in June by the Municipality and by the Mayor of the City, Gianni Alemanno.
"It is a fully independent committee in which all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas are represented," stresses Alemanno, "and the task is to develop proposals for the ideas of the Rome Development Committee, which may be the basis for the political decision-makers and the decision-makers.
There is no conflict of interest, we just wanted a platform where great plans could be born for the benefit of Rome.
In March, after completing its work, the committee will be split because it has a fixed term of office.
In June, we will present a strategic plan based on the work of the committee entitled "The future of the capital of Rome", the mayor said.
To those who consider the Commission's work unnecessary, referring to the fact that the expert opinion it has drawn up is not binding, Alemanno answers: "It all depends on what work the Commission will do and on the quality of the proposals it will make.
If the quality proves to be satisfactory, as in the case of the Attali Committee in France, which I am sure of in the case of Rome, the contribution it makes will play an important role.
The power of policy is often intertwined in the day-to-day management of cases and in the management of emergency cases from time to time.
We, on the other hand, look farther in terms of distance, plan the long-term and work hard for the development and future of Rome."
The mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is not considered to be a useless 'water head', as it is completely free, it will not cost a single euro to the citizens of Rome, but it will serve as an incentive to think and aim to attract the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "there is a need for an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that will allow our city to jump in the level it would need so much, thinking about its future in a unified spirit."
About the future, which the Mayor of Rome stresses: "Not only will it be limited to the current governmental framework, but it will look farther away", we see not only the future metropolitan and the capital status, but also what it means to be a mediterranean city, what it means and what it means."
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known, self-declared American politician wrote about this: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
“The first Jimmy Carter to break the American economy with his decisions and maintain close ties (as he does today as a person) with the enemy Islam.”
As the election draws nearer, the attacks against Obama are intensifying.
A Miami lady wrote on the internet: “This man is full of ambitions.
“Obama thinks he can win the highest public dignity of a nation with a total of two governors and five senators so far.”
These attacks are in fact nothing to say; of course they are racist, but they don’t answer the voters to the question of whether they will be a good president. Then here’s the public opinion research: it indicates that Obama will win, even with a significant boost.
In this case, there is someone who listens to his emotions and not his ears.
Inside the Southern States, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in its headline article: We know well that the true American homeowner is voting in the voting booth.
A side of American thinking appears here, which remained hidden until the last minute.
"Just talk what you want, and we'll know where we're going to put our money, Obama or McCain."
There are those who swear that if Obama wins, they will leave the United States.
Such words have never been heard until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all these clevernesses, the winning weapon of the Democrats is George Bush himself.
1,500 people were asked what mistakes were made during Bush’s tenure? 89 percent answered that Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation has lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and has been knocked into the air as it flew to its homeland.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans did not have to pack.
The majority still thinks that Iraq was Bush’s weakness.
It's a huge challenge for someone to take the place of George W.
USA: the economic collapse is already felt by journalists, the time has come for the editorials to be tightened. Many are accused of the Internet because of the "death" of the print press.
The PEW Research Institute asked five hundred American journalists how they felt about the future status of their profession and its intellectual power.
Well, at the moment, almost every journalist is a pessimist about his own future.
However, they did not make it clear that their concerns in terms of credibility would have decreased.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money.
They believe the 2008 crisis is a bankruptcy of a weak economic model.
There is another serious problem with the newsroom, i.e. restrictions on the editorial boards that make the newspaper.
If we don’t want traditional journalism, in the sense that the general public understands it, to minimize it, this problem needs to be solved,” the journalists said.
Today, pessimism and complexity are characteristic of American journalism.
Sixty percent of journalists and top executives working in the printed press are convinced that national criminalism is going the wrong way.
At the local level, 65 percent of journalists are in the top leadership position.
Printed against electronic press.
It doesn’t make it difficult for press workers to see where the global network is going.
The biggest publishers are paving the way for the Internet, which many consider to be the “killer” of the printed press.
The "economic pressure" perceived by journalists has increased to 79 percent.
The 500 interviewed journalists acknowledged that he was voting for technology in the hope that it might be in the interest of jurilistism.
Today, in the American press season, there is a gap between editors, i.e. directors, and the reporters working for them.
At the national level, 56 percent of managers are confident that their reporters will share their information with others, while at the local level, this ratio can only be reached at 23 percent.
Some people have this to do with a certain job.
At the national level, 47 percent of managers fear that they will lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this rate is 30 percent.
In America, the issue of "secure work" at the team level (for our editors, editors) is constantly on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists have a contract.
In a huge nation like the 300 million-populated United States, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and Internet service providers operate, employers usually offer as much as they want, so the thing works on a "should or shouldn't" basis.
Directors are usually paid high, and editors can earn <0x24>10,000 a month in addition to the pension and health insurance fees.
Freedom, on the other hand, operates on a rather complex principle: in the first year x day, in the third also until after a certain period it reaches a maximum of 15 days.
But American journalists, according to their own confession, often “sick” during the year.
It all depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: ROMEI BIROS<0xC3><0x81>G: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATABAN MARAD
Carmelo Rinaudo, the president of the Second Chamber of the Court of Rome, rejected the request of Danilo Coppola, a real estate agent, who wanted to move from his place of residence, Grottaferrata, to a Roman apartment.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of an investigation into the Unipol-BNL stock exchange agreement.
Last week, in the proceedings initiated against him, the domestic detention was disbanded and turned into a settlement ban for Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, have requested that the property owner move from the rural town to his apartment in the capital.
However, the court considers that these encroachments (for which the prosecutor made a refusal proposal) would allow it to influence the company’s affairs and have access to the evidence against it.
The Elite at Risk
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote for the <0x24>700 billion bailout package filed by the White House: a significant proportion of Americans were more interested, and still interested, in punishing Wall Street as rich.
This is also supported by yesterday’s New York Times, which reports that the current crisis has brought about a breakdown within the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided between traditional, depressed, new federal institutions, and federal and eastern governments.
This directive was published critically during the vote in the House of Representatives referred to in the introductory paragraph.
However, the event above is only one of the major changes that the economic reorganization that is still taking place, or lets it be seen, and not only in the United States, but in the entire Western world, and perhaps beyond.
It seems that the crisis, both in the US and in Europe, is only accelerating the long-standing phenomena that are solidified in this new atmosphere and are finally brought to light.
The first such phenomenon is the return to public awareness of the dual category of state sovereignty, the re-actualization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis affects banking and financial institutions that, although they have a close relationship with the outside world, yet, above all, and quite broadly, they are killing people and families who live in one country, in one state.
This, on the other hand, is a direct political challenge for those in government: how to respond to the difficulties and objections of people who are also voters.
So the crisis seems to be global in an economic sense, but almost exclusively national in a political sense.
It seems that political internationalism essentially lies outside the coastline: a clear proof of this is the European Union, which is unable to set a uniform political line between different interests and different national strategies.
Thus, everyone expects from the individual national governments to intervene, the bailout package, the revival and the new rules, but above all, the opening of monetary bases: since in the necessary situation, only individual states have economic resources, they can have financial resources, and they can have financial resources.
They also have the means and the power to use them: under certain circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that no other market and no international organization will likely ever have to that extent.
On the other hand, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on the national state is fully in line with the fact that recent economic growth is attributed to an increasingly important factor that is closely linked to this element: the territoriality.
In a paradoxical way, as we were convinced that we had already entered the network, the world of increasingly sophisticated technology has become more and more subtle, and we were convinced that the global financial world is destined to be more powerful than we are, more powerful than we are, more powerful than we are.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to the other, and yet completely bound to a confined place, can be connected to an area.
Thus, those who dominate the area have far more punches than those who, unfortunately, were born in a place where there is no crop, no oil, and no water.
I would also go on to the second novelty, which is a kind of fracture line.
Whoever says that territory, state, government, necessarily says: politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, it appears that the economic crisis is producing two phenomena that are intertwined:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for credible leadership is needed for those who are able to take on the events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, especially the economic leaders, will result in a complete loss of credit, who have proved completely inappropriate and have proved that many are still in front of them.
Together, the two have an even deeper significance and, in a sense, a more restless sense: a sense of loss of credit, impatience, inconvenience and separation, which affects the entire ruling elite in more and more Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that the population is increasingly convinced that the time of the social elite at its peak has expired. It has expired even before their actions, experiences, lifestyles, their cultures, their cultures, in a more complex sense of the word, in a more complex sense.
In other words, the demand for leadership in a burgeoned form is a generalized but powerful delegitimation movement that is fueled by a tendency to oppose the ruling class and the conventional political system. This was not expected by the voters in the "lazon" elections, or in recent times by the voters in the United States and in the United States.
It seems that, with its traditional elite, its parties, its programs, and even its customs, its press and its noble meaning, it seems that it is becoming less and less capable of representing what it is, for a time, more and more of a western society.
In spite of all this, it would be an exaggeration to speak frankly of "the uprising of the masses on the threshold".
Walking with open eyes is no harm at all.
We can walk with super strong glue on the wall
Using a super-powerful glue to defeat gravity and walk on the wall as a Pokémon.
This goal has been launched by several American research centers, and a group of four institutions is approaching the solution.
With just 2.5 square centimeters of adhesive, researchers managed to stick a 100-pound body to a vertical wall and keep it there.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The American journal Science has published the findings of several researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scientists was born from the further development of existing materials with a special structure called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of adhesive operation should be conceived as a package of spaghetti-like tube systems,” says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers came up with the idea of a leg covered with gecko microscopic cracks, which provides perfect adhesion to the animal.
Tests with various materials, such as glass, teflon and scrubbing paper, have proven that the new adhesive is ten times more effective than the soles of the aforementioned shells, at the same time "easily separated from the wall."
- "This material can be useful as a temporary adhesive" - adds Liming Dai.
We can walk on the wall, just like Pokémon? Maybe we do, but the researchers are thinking about a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes conduct heat and electricity well.
You can find more applications in the field of space exploration.
The superheroes are still waiting.
MASKING - The University of Berkeley in California is also conducting experiments with a new adhesive.
According to an article published in the American Chemical Society c., California scientists have introduced a hair-like, microfibre adhesive that goes through self-cleaning during movement on the surface, always providing perfect adhesion.
It's forbidden with fruit juice.
Be careful with grapefruit, orange and apples.
These high-vitamin beverages, especially in the summer, are popular, if they enter the body with certain life-saving drugs, they change their absorption, increasing or decreasing their effect, depending on the case.
The dangers of co-administering boxed or fresh fruit juices and certain medicines were highlighted by David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London. The professor at the American Chemical Society’s 236th annual meeting in Philadelphia, announced the life of a well-behaved and well-behaved man.
Grapefruit juice was already on the bench of the defendants in the past, when it was found to be able to increase the effect of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiety-reducing, heart rhythm-regulating, and neurological drugs to a toxic level.
MEDICINAL PROFESSIONALS - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Pharmaceuticals itself made public in the official announcement of the news, and at the same time warned doctors and patients to take seriously the aforementioned medications or to be taken seriously as a sign of co-consumption,consumption and risk.
GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange and apple juice also contains substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
A long list of active ingredients that are prevented from being absorbed by grapefruit and other fruit juices could be listed.
Michele Carruba, professor of pharmacy at Milan State University, said: “Such discoveries are usually immediately directed towards various national and international pharmacological institutions, who, if necessary, are required to obtain them.
Therefore, you should always read the package leaflet of the medicine you intend to take, and if something is incomprehensible, do not let yourself be influenced, but clearly ask our doctor or pharmacist," the specialist of the Ansa Institute stressed.
Paul Krugman won the Nobel Prize in Economics
Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, for his analysis of commercial models and the territorial contexts of economic activity.
The 55-year-old Neokeynesian Krugman teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the worst critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy measures.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in a headline article published in the New York Times that the latter event was even more decisive for the history of the United States than it would have consequences.
This prediction has not stirred up much debate, it has been put in the eyes of the economist in several ways, but today we know that it was accurate.
"I'm surprised and a little shocked at how quickly the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom has surpassed public interest," Krugman said in late 2002.
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, said Krugman was a "simplely valuable economist" but at the same time "aggressively spreads his criticism of the Bush administration's over-liberalism."
Open Office, the third edition of the "Microsoft vs. Microsoft" package
Today, OpenOffice.org’s 3.0 personal productivity-enhancing open-source application package aims to target ever-wider layers as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, from freelance to public administration.
After almost a year of work done by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office has been supervised by developers for almost a year, and has brought more innovations to the general public: a new version of Apple’s welcome screen and a new version of the new operating system.
They focused on compatibility with Office 2007 so that Open Office can also open Microsoft documents with the new extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Another interesting feature of some module specifics, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending files by email. Another feature supports the import of PDF files into the graphics module, with the page layout.
We can also create "hybrid PDF" documents on this interface, which combines the typical Adobe format with the table manager or text editor elements.
The sharing within the applications has also gone through a number of developments: the table manager supports the sharing of workbooks, but prevents the overwriting of each other’s work. Each employee’s comments are marked in a different color, which can help in the control of their workbooks.
Some companies are already working on making some of OpenOffice’s features available over the Internet (on the cloud, in the cloud), so the final version is likely to be unveiled in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, which has been available in English since Friday on the mirror pages, can be downloaded from the following address: http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
The program package is also available for Linux in addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
We can take the installation CD at our home or at our workplace on request.
In terms of the spread of home apps, free access is probably the biggest attraction, but the Open Office program package is now trying to kick the ball in the business sector as it can also count on a number of administration and school projects.
There is no shortage of ideal education, consulting and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business gaps.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, Word-suited text editor; Calc, Excel replacing table manager; Impress, PowerPoint presentations; Dbase is similar to the most popular, Access database manager; and finally Draw the graphical module.
The 2008 goal is to reach 5 million downloads. But considering that with the release of the new version we are already at over 3,600,000, this number is likely to be higher than expected.
Kohl’s result is also positive, this is the fourth doping case
In the last stage of the Tour de France, a positive pattern was again produced by one of the participants, the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, who competed in the colours of the Gerolsteiner team, who also won the best mountaineering shirt besides my bronzer.
The news was seen on the Internet newspaper Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer after Italian Ricco and Leonardo Piepol, and German Gerolsteiner-competitor Stefan Schumacher, who produced a positive result for the third-generation version of the EPO.
Kohl's blood sample, like the tests carried out in recent weeks, was tested in lausanne and chatenay-malabry laboratories.
If the control tests also confirm the positive Cera score, the Austrians will lose their third place and will be banned from the competition for two years according to the regulations.
The news about the positive result of Kohl’s third-generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, the head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and the Associated Press news agency said that the positive result was reported by the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrians managed to stand behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans as well as win the best mountaineering shirt.
NEW YORK TIMES RELATED TO QUESTION, ITALY IS RESSENTIAL?
Italy’s immigrant country has only recently become one of the most popular destinations for retreated immigrants.
This is the question raised by the New York Times, based on the case of young Burkina Faso Abdul William Guibre - who was murdered in Milan last month for stealing a box of cookies from a racist wrapper - a long piece of paper
The case is well-characterized by what the New York Times calls the "paradox of the ready": in the northern regions the "stronger integration and the highest employment" at the same time the "anti-immigration and support of the Northern League" are also the strongest countries.
To support the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also cited cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws required by the League, which would tighten the law on immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, have also been introduced as an example of a change of mood in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic also pointed out this trend: "Giorgio Napolitano XVI met Benedict in the Quirinale Palace and called for the state and the Church to work together to defeat racism".
Students suffer from expensive rental fees, up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>900 can cost a room
The market for hotels offered to university students is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by the Syndicate of Renters of Sunia, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomena has already taken up amazing sizes, which - due to the massive total costs for families - also shuts students from the possibility of learning," explains Laura Mariani, the head of the study department of the Sunia district, who has been involved in these cities.
In most cases, the property offers also include a number of irregularities: unregistered contracts that do not contain rent-limits, with linked rentals.
In the opinion of Sunia, an extraordinary measure would be needed to create an opportunity to maximise prices through the revision of the tax system.
The details of the survey show that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, a bed is also requested for 450 euros; the price of the single room ranges from 650 euros (the area of Bande Nere) to 800 euros on average (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera).
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room of about 700.
In Bologna, where the number of students lives near the university, a bed costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>250/280 if it is double, and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>370-500 if it is a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are requested for a single bed and 450 for a double room.
With something cheaper (550 euros a single room) the prices are around the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save everything in suburban districts: it costs 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, 300/450 euros are requested for a bed, from 400 to 600 euros for a room. The price range in Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei is the highest.
In the bar you will have to pay <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>250/350 for a bed and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are, in absolute terms, lower, but represent a greater weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students from outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, there is another disorder: the rental fee applied for by foreign students is about 25-30% higher than for Italian tenants.
Goodbye old Cinema Paradiso, the time of the old cinemas sacrificed in the cities
Traditional cinema is closed for the benefit of multiplexes.
“A city where there is no cinema, a blind city is like a face without eyes.”
The pictures by Giuseppe Tornatore show everything that is done in Italian big cities, but also in rural regions.
The reduction of cinema - the appearance of a large, multi-room cinema in the suburbs, and consequently the disintegration of one-room cinemas in the city centres - is a process that seems inevitable and irreversible, but at the same time carries a true cultural character.
When historical and memorable places disappear, "it's like a friend of ours is gone, a friend we've shared our way and a lot of experiences with," says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which took place twenty years ago, was awarded an Oscar, a salary, and was announced at the Festival of Cannes.
The largest association of operators, the data provided by Anec, is clear: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed. The biggest losses have been made in cinemas in major cities: in Bologna, in Bologna, in 6 cinemas in Bologna, in Naples, in Paolo and in Florence.
The most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna, which has lost 82 one-room cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the fact that the multiplexes have disappeared, we have no better evidence than the fact that Italy has the highest number of newly opened multi-room cinemas in these three regions: in the last five years, the number of rooms in Emilia-Romagna and Lombardy has increased by 195 in the last five years.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally," says President Paolo Protti of Anec. "It's okay to build new facilities, but the survival of existing ones should also be ensured, because when a city cinema closes, not all walks of the way will be crowded.
Not to mention the unloaded financial funds for the support of operators: the state’s outstanding debt can be estimated at around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million.
Ethically and morally, it is also shameful that the government fails to comply with the laws in force.
It would take between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 million and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million a year to maintain the market.”
The case of Bologna deserves special attention. It is the first Italian city to decide, with a view to protecting and stimulating the single-room cinema in the outer and downtown area, to remedy the problem through an agreement between the municipality and Anec.
The provisions would include tax discounts for operators and benefits for the public to promote accessibility: viewers can enter restricted areas and park at a discounted rate in certain parking lots.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, including other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
But it is also certain that traditional cinema, in order to be able to take on the battle with the mastery of multiplexes, needs to improve the sound and image quality, because today’s audience is much more demanding.
The protection of traditional cinema has always been an important question for me: the closure of Super Cinema in Bagheria – where I spent my childhood and youth – gave me the spark that made me finally do Cinema Paradiso, even though I have been stuck with it for 10 years.
I’ve been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the Via Nazionale in front of the closed Rialto or Quirinale, not to see posters blackened by dust, I’d rather turn my head.
Firm thread between politics and the 'ndrangheta, Gioia Tauro mayor arrested
"Mayor Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in municipal decisions".
Serious charges were filed against Mayor Gioia Tauro and Vice Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and against Mayor Carlo Martelli, who was detained this morning.
Gioacchino Piromalli, a senior mediator between the clan and the administration, and his nephew, a lawyer with the same name as the boss, who had previously been convicted of participating in a mafia-like crime alliance, were also given <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million.
"The lack of any legal and moral rule, the more it tastes good," the prosecutors write. The two local municipalities expressed their abbey intention to pay a counsel fee to Piromalli's lawyer.
"So the clan would have officially entered the town hall, which would have given an additional opportunity to control and control the administration, which can already be said to be significant.
Agazio Loiero, president of the General Assembly of the region of Calabria, does not hide that there are "numerous interactions between the local institutions and the organized underworld" in the region: There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where the interaction is almost impossible.
Many local politicians, however, are resisting the pressure of ‘ndrangheta,’ they are the heroes who remain clean.”
The arrests this morning are a continuation of the July events, when the police announced that they were able to complete the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were released from their mandate to run the municipality. Gioia Tauro's Municipal Committee was disbanded once in 1991, even due to alleged mergers between organised crime and the local municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian-democratic mayor who reigned during the split, led the right-central coalition in the second round of 2006.
He called for a vote when the House of Commons ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He cited the then Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minnin before the court and accused him of planning everything with a political aim. But the court in a detention order signed this morning stated that the Piromalli clan had dared to stop him and that he was going to join the A3 project.
In a hearing ordered against Dal Torrione, the prosecutors wrote, it was clear that "it was willing to meet the demands of a large group of entrepreneurs who were known to be close to the Piromalli family, the municipality's decisions."
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come
An inexhaustible energy source that makes up 70 percent of the planet’s surface and that is only now being discovered by major international energy companies.
Waves, tenge currents, streams, all of them renewable energy, which giants like Chevron have looked at, who are now trying to put their hands on.
For hundreds of years, research has been underway on how to generate energy from the movements of the sea. In the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research increased.
Around 1980, when the price of crude oil fell, the idea of the use of marine energy was discouraged, but today the rise in demands for environmental protection and the price of crude oil again gives the industry a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) estimates in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by installations that exploit the waves of the seas.
This amount is twice as much as what nuclear power plants are currently producing.
In addition, there would still be currents and currents.
The giants are in a hurry.
Enersis was the first company to commit to marine energy and in 2005 signed an agreement on a power plant to be established in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary move when the signing was announced.
Two years have passed since, and more and more companies are voting for marine energy, including those who have been committed to supporting conventional energy.
“Chevron is studying technologies that exploit the energy of the oceans and is considering the possibility of working with us,” said a spokesman for one of the U.S. oil giant’s affiliated companies, the Wall Street Journal.
The cooperation in question relates to the obtaining of the permit necessary for the initiation of the Alaska project for the use of marine energy issued by the U.S. Energy Committee.
This is not of little importance, especially given the fact that the U.S. is continuing its oil production in Alaska, and President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc., New York, and Ocean Power, New Jersey, are also on the way to sea energy. The amounts invested so far, as much as you can know about the details, are evidence of growing interest.
Technology is awaiting development.
According to experts, it is still an initial technology so far, just because the energy from the sea does not divide the doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing facilities, similar to those of Portugal or Scotland, are all small and therefore do not pose a very large problem in terms of the ecosystem.
In order to be able to produce more energy, however, we need facilities that have a greater environmental impact as well.
There are several options: for example, Ocean Power uses a coil system that is connected to one another.
The pressures generated by the waves and moving the booms are transformed into hydraulic pressure by the pistons and cylinders placed within them.
The pressure rotates a turbine, which feeds a generator.
Electricity comes to land on the cables that run under the sea.
Currently, there are four similar facilities in the planning phase, which are only waiting for the federal permit. Part of the energy generated would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started producing energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six submarine turbines located in New York’s East River coastline.
When the wind blows, the movement of the water rotates the blades of the turbines, and this rotation feeds the generator.
Verdant said he has a long list of partners who are only waiting for permissions to use the energy.
After the waves, there's electricity.
At present, the opportunities that can be exploited through the price path are worth distinguishing attention.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, the current is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the waves, and is therefore considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, spent <0x24>7.5 million in 2008 to exploit the energy provided by the railroad, which is projected to grow to <0x24>35 million in 2009.
