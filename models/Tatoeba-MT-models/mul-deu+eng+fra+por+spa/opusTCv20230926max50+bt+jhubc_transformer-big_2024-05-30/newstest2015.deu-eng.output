Mr. Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the world’s third largest economic nation.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India is also hoping for a Defence Cooperation Treaty between the two nations.
Karratha Police Arrested 20-Year-Old After Fast Motorcycle Hunting
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police reported that the driver then ignored the stop signals and drove further on Burgess Road before taking off to the bushland, where officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponded to the description of the driver were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgariarra.
Karratha police accuse a 20-year-old man of failing to observe a stop sign and of ruthless driving.
He is scheduled to appear in court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster Accused of Hotel Rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is being prosecuted for rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was charged in a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at the Scottish Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, asleep, and could not signal consent."
Webster is also charged with raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date of the trial for the Supreme Court in Edinburgh on November 17.
Reflecting on the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Members of Congress Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as civil rights.
“Just as unions die, middle-class jobs die,” said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud to introduce the Employee Empowerment Act together with civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers equal legal opportunities for discrimination on the grounds of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination – and thus stops anti-syndicalist forces.
Supplementing the National Labour Law to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a trade union representation in order to appeal to a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation or penalties - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative – at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill proposed is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the backlashes that trade unions have faced in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country – Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and uphold labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to unity in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions had a role to play in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers to unification and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism would be replaced by Adolf Hitler by a strong democracy.
Recognizing the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve the working and economic conditions.
Agreements restricting or aiming at reducing this right shall be null and void; measures aimed at it shall be unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added to Roosevelt a right to guarantee, or guarantee, that "everything that was taken over by the United Nations as a global agreement would be done."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union – and that this union should then be allowed to participate in collective bargaining as equal partners with companies and government bodies – should be protected.
After these rights have been violated in America, it is indeed very wise to re-establish the American ideal, as a result of which the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers’ movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but enlarged it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, labor has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and we should do the same.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of representatives of workers - has long been overwhelming.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and set the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily halts law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. judge suspended the enforcement of a law in Louisiana on Sunday, saying lawyers said it would likely lead to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was raised by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and is due to enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors carrying out abortions to have a patient right to hospital admissions within a 30-mile radius to obtain their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors can temporarily continue to perform legal abortions while applying for such a right.
“The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while endeavoring to achieve these rights,” Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing will be held for the judge to make a more permanent decision for the law.
Proponents of abortion welcomed the decision, the most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures, and said that doctors will spend so much more time obtaining hospital admissions rights.
“Today’s decision means that women in Louisiana are escaping from a restraining law that wants to take their health and their rights away from them,” said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which has been held on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the complaint and also applied for the right of induction.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
Key points of a Texas law that would have forced most of the clinics in the state to shut down were halted by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association agree that admission rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Opponents of abortion argue that the measures serve to protect women’s health, although some also welcomed the impact of closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient induction rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to do no more abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation out of fear for his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, representatives of the state of Louisiana said they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions while their applications for patient dismissal rights would still be pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher ovarian cancer death rates in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural areas of Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1,100 Australian women who had ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after the diagnosis.
Researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman’s age at diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing premature diseases, and social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer had already progressed further at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
In spite of the improvement of telemedicine services in order to counteract distances, she proposed, as a possible remedy, a reinforcement of the service of surrogate doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women with closer care in their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said the study, regardless of geographical status, found a poor long-term survival rate in women with ovarian cancer and emphasized the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret the declining number of homeowners
The decline, combined with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under 35, could lead gardening centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today’s young consumers, according to a study by the HTA, reach the “nuclear age group for garden products,” according to the Financial Times.
The report reports that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount people spend with their own home for their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting front gardens for parking purposes, and the declining garden size are other factors threatening the industry, in which an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion is implemented in sales annually.
In the Greater London area, where over a period of 6 years the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent, the smallest expenditure on garden products per household is listed.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that renting homes or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, Chief Gardening Advisor for the RHS, said: "Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail due to the increasing number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improvement in the market situation for this year due to better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and clergyman Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital, Islamabad, around 1,000 protesters stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters back out of PTV buildings.
The transmitter shut down for about 40 minutes, but is now retransmitting.
At the same time, around 3,000 protesters tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometre away, they were given clashes with security forces equipped with sticks and stones.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif’s resignation, but he refused.
The country’s military is warning of a political solution to the conflict, “without wasting time and using violence.”
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday night, the military said: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan, and has already dumped more often.
Opposition politician Imran Khan has accused Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in parliamentary elections in May last year.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to advance to Sharif’s residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey orders U.S. diplomat for espionage reports
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has asked the country’s oldest U.S. diplomats to report on U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. Embassy's businessman and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept reported that those by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a major area of activity for the U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report, saying that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that even Germany’s most important intelligence service had Ankara in sight provided much more outrageous reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: locomotive drivers threaten with consequences for pedestrians
The federal-wide warning strike by the locomotive drivers on Monday night could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The announcement for 18 to 21 hours concerns all transport companies throughout the state, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main direction of the warning strike is freight traffic.

Sven Schmitte, the district chairman of the German Lokomotivführer (GDL), said in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main direction of the warning strike is freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it is difficult to predict the consequences concretely.
Police chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
Prosecutors on Friday presented evidence of extortion by police and employees of the city of Calvià to the Attorney General’s Office of Mallorca.
The chief of the police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested on corruption charges by businessmen and barbers at the famous binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was detained on corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the Attorney General for Anti-Corruption of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are being interrogated together with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the annoyed nightclub owners said the government’s parent economy had a serious impact on their businesses.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Let our basics of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist who executed 24 men during a sauvage tour of Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to stop the abuse of alcoholic vacationers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the famous alcoholic cafe tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the fellation incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organiser Carnage jointly had to pay a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 (<0x24>73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several alcohol-induced accidents, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to the other or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FR<0xC3><0x9C>HLING has provided South Australia with a winter surprise, with heavy thunderstorms and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m. another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen in the night to Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy shears, including a cast, which began just before 20:00 and resulted in almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week had provided an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city again fell to a peak of only 15.8<0xC2><0xB0>C on Monday.
The swinging weather conditions probably led to the delayed landing of a flight of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a squirrel – a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance – and had to start.
At that time, wind blows reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to take off even on a second landing flight and finally set up at about 20.40.
The flight delay subsequently resulted in delays on some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
On Tuesday a maximum temperature of 16<0xC2><0xB0>C is forecast for Adelaide, with possible rainfall.
Matthews says it’s high time for big networking
Given the galoping technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech switching centers, our columnist Bernd Matties comforts himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessories.
As I write this, my gaze falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, "Boah, how retro is that?"
But there’s a thought behind it: if the cable weren’t, all the listeners would fly around the house in no time, and that would be significantly more retro.
Anyway, it applies to the ecletronic (ecletronic?
No, tip error: electronic) sector the rule that today's world novelty is the electric scrap of tomorrow bought - outdated.
And who, for example, still has a TV in the living room today, simply says that he basically refuses television.
Why these considerations?
Because pushing the Ifa at the radio tower this week brings us back to our absolute incompetence in electronics issues.
The Laie, who once blindly mastered the washing machine and CD player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread out with an incomprehensible voice of experts before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press station.
Yeah, it's all right?
What are you going to talk about with people who seem to voluntarily spread such quarks?
Basically, it’s been about 20 years now, and it’s all about connecting our house.
So that the yoghurt itself re-orders, so that the fire detector informs us during the holidays in the Maldives that it burns in the study room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we from the office air conditioning to our soon arrival ...?
Yes, but that requires an air conditioning.
But a dream will surely come true soon: we lift our wristwatch, say to her, "Suck!" - and the vacuum robot goes home.
Wrong.
Everything goes on to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods float", a connoisseur of the industry says, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses do not show us how long the pizza is still in the baking pan.
We also know from the daily practice that if a new fashionable device is really needed urgently, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions as well.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air shelters, while rocket and mortar fire on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, the gangs of the Gaza Strip and the schools were closed.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in southern Israel, which were drawn by rocket launchers, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed before the students arrived grenade splitters from the walls and sliding walls.
“We’re a little scared, but excited,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it felt "a bit funny" to suddenly go back to school.
“These were difficult times, and we didn’t leave the house at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke out last week, thousands of residents of border communities such as Sead remained in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a Gaza border town heavily targeted by Palestinian shootings.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and provide security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire prompted an immediate end to the fighting, but important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas’ demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by Palestinians and the UN.
Israel disproves these data and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip, and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and fights continue, the educational authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will be reopened soon so that we can continue learning, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU visa Strobl challenges NPD ban procedures
In view of the NPD’s loss of vote in Saxony, CDU Federal Visa Officer Thomas Strobl has decided to end the ongoing NPD ban procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
CDU-Bundesvisa Thomas Strobl said the ongoing prosecution proceedings against the NPD should be brought to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is cutting worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU country chief in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a pleasant development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD failed to reach the five-percent threshold at the vote on Sunday.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party was unsuccessful in 2003 because the constitutional protection at the time also had informants at the top of the NPD.
In December 2013, after a long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for New Refugees
In the New Zealand square, refugees are now housed in tents.
The central first-time reception for refugees in Harburg is located from all seams.
Now the internal authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
The district politicians were only briefed in advance - they are little enthusiastic.
“These hauruck actions continue to spur citizens’ reservations and give district politicians no opportunity to contribute constructively to the human accommodation of refugees,” said Britta Herrmann, Greens’ group chairman at the Harburg district assembly.
Her party demands that the district administration of Harburg make available unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the initial recruitment are the storm of seekers of help - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, according to a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homeowners in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the 12-month increase by August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data’s research director, Tim Lawless, said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-part market.
According to RP Data, house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne they increased by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rise by an average of five and six percent.
On the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending, where prices have only increased by 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr Lawless said that with the start of spring, there would now be an increase in the properties for sale that would undergo a "real test" for the market for the next few months.
“Considering the ongoing high rate of auction prices, an overall fast selling rate and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise further in the next three months,” he said.
In a statement to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of CEO Peer Medau and attests to posing "like a fieldman".
The style of the college is not that, it says in the statement.
The Medau family had already been informed orally in mid-June about the views of the university.
The statement that the plans were not announced until July is definitely wrong,” said Pötzl.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans are not "preferences or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle, which is necessary for access, is also less dramatic than feared by the medalists.
There was and is not a nine-metre-wide street.
According to the current state, it is 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before,” explains Pötzl.
The Medau operators’ argument that their free and school-owned parking spaces will then only be used by students of the university in the future, does not want Pötzl to apply.
Trains are not parked at all, because this can now be solved intelligently as with other public parking spaces.
Thinking of the neighbors
The children’s cradle of Bergwichtel, which is located on the site and in front of which the entrance to the park deck would lead, according to the university president, “does not be affected”.
Rather, it is to be borne in mind that this is not only about the children’s crib, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
So it’s much more than the particular interests of Mr Medau,” says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parental council of the children's crib, with which the road would be expanded, is justified to "lost one of the few naturally-occupied spots of Coburg", "the reader himself can decide".
In early October, Pötzl, together with the State Building Office of Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the structural development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new resolution".
Peer Medau had last week informed the parents of the children’s crib about the college’s plans.
Accordingly, the access to the new park deck is intended not to lead over the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße as before, but over the Medau Mountain.
Thus, the narrow road would have to be expanded in two tracks, about a kilometer long.
According to calculations of the medals, traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would increase by tenfold.
There are about 2,000 vehicles per day.
From the sides of the city, we did not want to comment on the project so far.
Glandorf retires from national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga SG Flensburg-Handewitt pointed to health problems for this decision.
I did not like the decision easily, it has matured over several months.
It’s time for me to listen to my body’s signals and end my career in the national team,” the 2007 World Champion said on his Facebook page.
He has a record of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany to retire internationally.
Because he wants to go on goal hunting for the Champions League winner from Flensburg for a few more years, he is no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announced his framework for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf had a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have fascinated me just as much as they will fascinate my longtime colleagues and my successors.
But for my club, I want to be healthy in the coming years too, for which longer regeneration breaks are needed, which does not allow the current double load.
The left hand had to fear the end of his career in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Association (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which had later triggered a severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team careers go unnoticed by no body.
I have some health buildings that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot operations, which took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never got my blood pressure right into the grip.
This includes some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year, I noticed that I control my head, but I can’t fool my body,” Glandorf told Handball Time in an interview.
For a comeback, he would only be available in an absolute emergency.
“When all knitting is ripped, I’m always ready to talk,” the two-time father told the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go straight in at least some way.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League win, he won the 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) EHF Cup.
In 2012 he also secured the European Cup winners with Flensburg.
German economy decreased by 0.2 per cent in the spring
Crises around the world have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 per cent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was communicated by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investments declined.
External trade also slowed down the economic downturn.
Thanks to the strong year-on-year pace, a total GDP increase of 0.8 per cent over the second half of 2013 is achieved.
Horstmar was the starting point and destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which first led through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The castle town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, hosted the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
This is the largest cycling tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1,000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for the organization of this tour of the Münsterland.
Published in various journals, this tour was offered to interested people.
We come from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know Münsterland more closely in this way as well," the cyclists wondered about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration at the association home of the Schützenbrüderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
Further, the route, which was written for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz via the Kreppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Bilderbeck back to Horstmar.
On tracks of 95 kilometres at 1175 kilometres, 120 kilometres at 1475 kilometres and 145 kilometres at 1775 kilometres, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were taken care of on the way to Havixbeck and Bilderbeck.
The main organizer Jos ter Huerne and the Deputy Mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all the participants.
The organization ran without problems and there were no negative incidents", draws Heinz Lölfing a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see you again in 2015 in hopes of good weather on August 30 or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers planned a new edition.
Konstantin Waker's relentless honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which has brought to paper Konstantin Waker, song maker, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, in "Monks and Warriors" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more lyrics for lyrics, the Municher, born on June 1, 1947, wrote down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by an appropriate lyric.
And he’s honest: From the onaniac as a high school student to theft of cargo and drug use, he doesn’t let out human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also embraces abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all that he tries to go to the ground, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment – and also how he was not only influenced by music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter also brought the living man Konstantin Waker closer to the Ascetic monk, who is created "by subtraction", as he says, "by removing everything unnecessary".
Among all the high-minded views, however, there are also short anecdotes about the earth: for example, about slaughterhouses in one of GI’s frequented premises or a crazy car ride, where he frontally annoyed a tree.
He is also relentlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into his arms.
I never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Midlands, in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and his relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: "Stop the crawl.
Leave your sister alone.
Move it! Move it!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who had grown up when I was a child, went to the bar with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket stroke.
I've never had a conversation like this with him.
Much of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a casting shop in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than in his father's days, he gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little lighter now, but they're dark, smoked, deep stygic labyrinths with flames and smoke and a lot of rust.
My father used to just lay in the bathtub and then you could slowly hear him sing because he could wash the caster from himself.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
However, Henry grew up as a child without his parents’ love testimony.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
It was only when my mother got sick at the end of her life that we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me! Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness ding and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it's hard.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry’s career change may be shown in his elegant, short-sleeved bark.
Since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he has been taken by the theatre.
It followed The Comedy of Mistakes, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started at the age of 16 when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was for a fairly long time the only black imitator/comedian on television."
He studied in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow big in the eyes of the public, but I also learned from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke storytelling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage rights at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I somehow wish it had never happened, but I don’t regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this “year-old award-winning lightweight pillar of British television” was also a “great parody of black people.”
By introducing characters that mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked in the 1980s on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s, he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and movie roles marked his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought, "What are you next, Len, because everything feels like you're just taking time out or doing a little bit of the place."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school, and I considered him predominantly a middle-class domain, white in stockings and a coal head in front of him.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Denk said, "You should try it.
Don't do it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary, and he was thrilled.
I felt like I was able to do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head up.
"It's about it, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn’t happen.
Soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
All of a sudden I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
“A small voice told me, ‘You have to bridge for 10 minutes while they’re repairing the computer.’”
Instead, the stage director announced that the idea went on as soon as the problem was solved.
I walked out of the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
This came to pass, too, so it's like a big sign of the gods who say to me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a donor voice.
So I'll stay.
I really love that.
I love being in a test room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has been through humorous outbursts as he repeatedly mimics people.
I have decided not to do stand-up comedy because I think this kind of instant gratification from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you are always looking for it, you drive in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in Apollo when I want to, but overall I don’t have as much as I used to.
I asked him if he would ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to shape a beginning, a middle part, and the end of a journey – I don’t think I ever want to give up again.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that’s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block roads in Yemen’s capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthi have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Huthi party "Ansar Allah" said.
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reports of a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the Yemen Post newspaper, Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for action on Sunday evening.
Huthi, according to the newspaper, threatened to further escalate the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Huthis are fighting for greater independence from Sunni-run Yemen and demanding the resignation of the government.
The Huthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Approximately 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the main access roads of Sanaa.
There are bloody battles with the Yemeni army in the countryside.
Kenya Registers Officials to Detain "Spirit Employees"
Kenya has begun to biometrically register all state officials to delete "spirit employees" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, a government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people still receive salaries even after their farewell from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service at his 2013 post.
A review earlier this year found that at least <0x24>1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) per month was lost in payments for “spirit workers” and other misused financial practices.
The government suspects that wages will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports to the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are included, a government statement said.
Anyone who did not do this without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the statement said.
"This process will contribute significantly to the rationalization of public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also clearing the salary list at both levels of government - that is how the "spirit employees" will be eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the secretary of the cabinet and the secretary of the ministerial center.
The scandal surrounding Art Advisor Helge Achenbach will be negotiated for the first time in court on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, in a civil trial at the Düsseldorfer Landgericht, claim 19.4 million euros for damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings.
This was reported by a court spokeswoman on Monday.
The lawsuit states that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of artworks and vintage watches and Berthold Albrecht calculated higher purchase prices than actually paid.
As a result, the agreed commission is also higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was in school for 44 years, of which 23 were school leaders.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many of Petershausen and Kollbacher's standings from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his desire to see people in the student.
The snow top is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudden Germans were deposed.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a warehouse it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
So the judge went to the Oberfranken-Senkendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week ten kilometres to the next station, take the train to Bamberg, go three kilometres across the city to school and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleeping opportunity in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory.
In 1951 he made the first and after three years of teaching candidates in 1954 he made the second state exam.
As Oberfranken did not have a free teaching position for him, he applied to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Frauen-Zimmer" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he built a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were summarized in Petershausen in today’s city hall.
When the Indersdorf school association was founded, only the primary school remained in place.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, then Rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
However, Petershausen grew up, and as of September 1982, the children and their teachers were able to receive the current construction, which was expanded after Richter's retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who, at the expense of the municipality, built an office space and at the time of the 1997 expansion, although this was not eligible under the school building guidelines.
"Bürger Götz was very school-friendly," the judge recalled gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a lecture on law and justice by a school board: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter enacted what he had heard there as a young teacher.
“You have to give your children two things: roots and wings,” says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn, "It doesn't always work." Whether he's just talking about his pupils or his own six kids, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Judge's actions were sometimes unconventional.
When the students ransacked, they did not get a criminal job from him, nor were they condemned to sit down.
At the expense of the municipality, the judges had bought two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two counterparts face each other, even if there had to be a spark.
As rector, the judge maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the partyless judge after his retirement to run for council in 1996 at least as the last on the CSU list.
However, Judge was elected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 Bicycle riders make stops in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scotland
If cyclists rest on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scotland, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday alone, however, the number of resting people impressed: the 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour along with accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in the Scottish Alteburg Park.
Under the slogan "Ride and celebrate on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and attended a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometres above Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further into Scotland.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started with the bike in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the own business Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring, were welcomed.
For the refreshment of body and mind, all sorts of good things had been prepared: the rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, zwetschen, stew and cheese cakes, which were wonderful for the good riders.
"Such cakes can only be baked by rural women," a participant from Aulendiebach praised, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be made at the drink stand of the Geiß-Nidda tournament.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained visitors with well-known melodies from operas and musicals and aroused enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful atmosphere of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He has earned it, he has finally re-attached skipped bike chains today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the company manager had to work: they were interviewed at the fountain in front of reporter Rainer Janke’s drinking pub and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Tobias Hagen, who has been a tour guide since his first hr4 bike tour in 2004, was also able to navigate briefly, although he had plenty to do with local technology.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees via three phones and a radio device and the police 15-headed motorcycle squad from Hessen, wrote Facebook entries and made reporters, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia are cyclists.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available overnight capacities.
In category I, the participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
From the resort, the cyclists had a good impression when they woke up again after an hour and a half: "Goodbye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they said goodbye.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening, the cyclists were asked in the idyllic Alteburg park.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had a nice festive atmosphere and, of course, had prepared treats, such as flaming cakes with well-cooled feather whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as a board member of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were apparently pleased with the "many operations in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity for swinging outdoors was eagerly used despite the sporty activity on the bike.
Among the guests were more and more citizens, who were treated by the good mood as well as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wachtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trennwalds - were on the program for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of racing, the athletes again entered Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish policemen arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", local media agencies reported.
The police did not make any direct comments.
Among the detainees are 14 senior police officers, Hürriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal association and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister) described her actions as part of the activities led by the Islamic clergyman Fethulla Güllen against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful everywhere in Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people’s front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, head of the school in Slavyansk, who visited Yazenyuk's daughter, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally reign here again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
She meets with a proud slice of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And she has her own frontier experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearson’s media world.
She served as chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when Pearson's parent company's senior position went to a younger male colleague.
His salary was reportedly nearly <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Their political rankings are also solid.
She was recommended by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he sought more private business knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
Already in May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned glass.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inside the first guard of the management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates an almost unsustainable duopoly that calls for comprehensive reform.
But what newly-incoming president would risk taking the plunge on everything and taking on an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps trying to get around his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn’t enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC diminishing – outdated power, money, and status.
As competition draws closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable security, the forthcoming negotiation of license fees for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public is buying into the world’s largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households, each costing only 40 pence a day.
And apparently, the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support them today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone today and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and attentive institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says tweeting was not authorized
A tweet from the official account of Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a defamatory remark about the Democratic District Attorney who is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry's user account, which denies the previous one.
I just sent a tweet from my account that wasn’t authorized by me.
"I don't cheapen the tweet and I deleted it," he said in a statement.
Perry’s staff did not immediately respond to requests for comments.
Although the tweets from Perry's official user account, it was not clear who was actually serving the feed.
In the previous tweet, an unfavorable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013, was taken.
Perry vetoed her office’s financial promotion when she refused to step down, leading to a charge against Perry — who might be a 2016 presidential candidate — before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk with the three-fold permissible alcohol level ... but if I do, I complain to Governor Perry when he applauds it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the management over the Grand Jury's investigation into Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio special prosecutor who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-ranking team of legal occupants applied to the judge concerned with the case to dismiss the charge and argued that the law against the most senior governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutional.
Perry stopped <0x24>7.5 million in government funding to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and is investigating state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto resulted in a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After graduating from the Iowa elections during his 2012 presidential candidacy as fifth, Perry went on to speculate that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself while jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, come on!"
Berkeley declares housing market to be “normal”
One of London’s most prominent builders pointed out that the housing market in southeast England has “returned to normal” levels.
Private homes in the capital were hotly coveted and subject to enormous price increases, which moved the Bank of England due to widespread fear of a credit bubble to set ceilings for mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the high-end construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the 2013 summit,” adding that this is a “stable business environment.”
The London real estate market was well positioned during the slowdown as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the catastrophic authorities, prices in the urban area alone jumped 18.5 percent last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales overall.
Average sales prices for Berkeley’s private, affordable and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year and were <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, in recent months, a stronger pound has made real estate in London less attractive to foreign buyers – some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "will tax" before the general election in May.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which introduced tighter lending regulations, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, also suggesting that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, adjusted its forecast for London’s real estate price hike down to 3 percent in 2015, based on a weakening house price awareness.
The transaction volume in London’s most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now declined by a quarter year over year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Still, the desire to own a home in the capital city of Berkeley is a blessing as the due amounts for future sales amount to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, scheduled sales have also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year by the end of April – almost a third more than the peak in 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings increased by 40 percent annually to <0xC2><0xA3>280 million, revenue by 18 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday ahead of the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that revenues for Berkeley in the current year are expected to meet current market expectations.
Analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley shares stood at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in London trading this afternoon.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence posted by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence performs at the 85th Oscars.
Naked photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of another 100 Starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real and complained to the hacker for "eclectic breach of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will track down all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan were allegedly acquired by a gap in Apple's iCloud online storage system. The alleged "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Olhanna, Kim Kardashian, and Mary Elizabeth.
It is not certain how many of the images are real, though Winstead, star of "Scott Pilgrim vs. the Rest of the World" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who are looking at photos that my husband and I took in the private environment of our house years ago - I hope you're really happy with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickelodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" disagrees, however, that the photos are about pictures of her and tweeted, "These so-called nude images of me are ALL, folks.
Let’s take a look at the beginnings. *Word game intended*
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos from her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They shattered, so that they could best describe it, they loosen up slowly like a cardboard that has been left standing in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, too strenuous, intense, distant, and perhaps a bit scratchy.
Then he shook his hand.
He knew Kratzbürstig.
He was a bit of a joke, like in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stalemate was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising for alleviating the solitude of his life than ever before, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a terribly delicate beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come with an older companion to the south, who considered Kevern to be her aunt, and who had inherited a property in a wet but paradise valley with the proper name Paradise Valley.
For several years no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaky, there were spiders in the bathrooms, bare snails had left their marks on all the windows and believed that they owned it all, and the garden was overgrown with weeds, which looked like giant boiler heads.
It was like the house from a kindergarten, both threatening and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" stands on the Longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn on the broken armchairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, both of whom had joined the service console in an absence of spirit, who had slapped the country with a soothing music, an ankles, and a calming message to her.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on the console.
Not banned - nothing was so properly banned - just not played.
It was successfully obsolete, just as the word obsolete.
The general taste had created what decrees and regulations had never done, and just as people choose from books the from dishwasher to millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and love novels, so they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing in a rough-comic Serenade Ailinn's large feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told me.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it costs you a penny.
It wasn’t a very funny game at the time, and it wasn’t very funny now.
He knew that this was expected from him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of them.
Jazz was not played even if it was not directly banned.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
The mind as well.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without hearing about Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father’s semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn’t have to explain to Ailinn that Fat Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn’t remember a time when pop singers weren’t black.
Again, no laws or coercion.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society agreed gratefully to the principle of group giving – gratefully as those spared by fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temperament and bodybuilding, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were as blessed by nature with electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a working service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levante, whose grandparents had not left the country very quickly when it was pressed, when it was pressed, because of fear of being accused of firefighting, even because of fear that the flames would have consumed them, and they would have consumed them with the next squirrel.
Each according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailin to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just suggested to her could ever be confused.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him a deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge kohl-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father love such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She thought, anyway, that he was something special.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern’s sight.
There was nothing else to see around the world but your uncombed black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say it," she said without persuasion.
But that doesn't explain why you're telling me.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked up again.
Don't your feet that straight.
Maybe your ankle, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverse.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because like his father, he didn’t have the soothing charm needed to embellish the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons got red and got out of her chair, threw the console around and spilled the wine they had drunk.
Holunderblütenwein, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like a palm wedge in a storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly the reason why I feel perversely attracted to you," she said.
Except that I'm not.
She suffered for him, both because of the unnecessary unpleasantness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and sadder than their ancestors were as smugglers and beach smugglers, moved from bar to bar, always willing to raise their hand against a woman who refused or abandoned them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she hadn't been careful!
They just scratch - scratching was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the insatiable love balls from the console - they first scratch and then hit.
In Kevern’s view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the knotting itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign of walking through her body.
He got up from the chair like an old man.
She also felt that she was still, but the swelling of her sorrow surprised her.
This was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She looked at him as he walked away – as if from a room on the upper floor her companion looked at him – a man complaining of something he himself had complained about.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, though some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bent on his back, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit – why was that a sight that she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time that she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
A few years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative body of surveillance for the public mood, was not told in a brief lecture about the continued violence, when he was invested in the lowest and the lowest in the middle of the country, in the most violent, and in the most extreme.
"A lot has already been done, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to mitigate the innate aggressiveness of a people who waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of the human soul has been torn down between the old and the old.
But some properties turn out to be indestructible.
The higher the church tower, the less the passion he continues to awaken.
The population cries when they hear sentimental ballads, is drawn to stories of overcome difficulties and claims to firmly believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only does the former ruthlessness deprive the rural communities, but also supports the new homes, supports the house and maintains the urban sense of feeling.
"They have an unhappy tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme nut tree lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you lesbian?
Esme reiterated its right to privacy and denial of the statement.
Feminist?
Shut up again.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is an unbiased workplace.
We serve a non-judgmental society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, can occasionally distort results, as you have imagined them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call "backward" and "white" could be interpreted by others just as well as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to look around what it is, if it is, as if, if it had happened, it would have happened yesterday, it means taking the country its essential vital force of life.
Esme Nussbaum looked around, while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED script in Flamingosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter century or longer.
Smile her neighbor, appreciate her partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use her phone, speak, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the spoken word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want out of it," Esme Nussbaum replied in a calm voice as she was sure that her supervisor had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not yet as effectively cured as we pretend ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves in the process of repeating the mistakes that lead only to WHAT IS WELL, WHEN IT IS WELL.
But this time it is not the others to whom we omit our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
This means an english patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you refer to actions as "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far if you say that they have omitted their “wut” and their “distrust” of “others.”
It shouldn’t actually be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past, like protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “others”.
There was no “we” and there was no “other”.
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From whom, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to challenge, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what has happened has happened.
That was at the time.
There is nothing more to be said about this - we agree.
And just as no guilt needs to be allocated, so no guilt needs to be forgiven if such an allegation is appropriate and if there is a way to forgive it.
But what does the past do if we don't learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget it.
If I can say something about it--
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I'll consider her report," he said and released her.
The next day, as she went to work as usual, she was overtaken by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, was riding on the trail in a kind of "brutal anger".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Officials of the military in Lesotho agreed to plan a coup d'état to overthrow the government and said they were going against policemen who are being prosecuted for armament of political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country's army had surrounded its official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to neighbouring South Africa after he reported threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no de facto coup but that the military was responding to the threat by “political fanatics” whose armaments were being carried out by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the defense forces of Lesotho acted after he had received several intelligence reports that inside the police some elements were acting that actually wanted to arm some of the political, partisan young fanatics, who were facing America," he said.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a turnaround.
“Even if no one has claimed to have violently torn the government on its own, all reports agree that the activities of the Lesotho Defence Forces so far show signs of a coup,” he said.
Speakers of the Lesotho military said on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating to their barracks and that the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing will take over government leadership during Thaban's absence.
Thabane said he believes he has become the target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there has been great tension since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to clashes in his unified government.
He said his actions would not have untermined the government, in spite of other loud accusations.
Eurozone production at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, according to a closely-observed study.
The final Marketit Shopping Manager Index (PMI) of the manufacturing industry fell to 50.7 in August, after a standing of 51.8 in July.
A statement above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced breakdowns in an era of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will appear before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant euro area recovery and for the imminent deflation at a inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could make further details over the course of this week whether he is considering a quantitative relief for the eurozone, according to those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“While small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more pronounced for manufacturers,” said Rob Dobson, a leading economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economic nation of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as is Italy’s descent from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in key industrial mechanisms in Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer affected is also not reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to spark the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing you can say about the sales management index of the producing industry in the eurozone from August is that the sector continues to grow after that.”
He added: “Producers in the eurozone are apparently finding life quite difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions – especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine – are increasing uncertainty in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and the confidence of consumers, and are likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even canceled, in particular large-scale orders.
He said it would be "more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to launch some sort of QE, "although we suspect this will be limited."
The Decade of Hell of the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrifying siege of the school, as the children involved in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Czech militias at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped from the murder in the classroom.
Just a decade after the horrific siege of Beslan School, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy unites the West and the East into hatred, and then turns surprisingly into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst of misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will chase them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now bringing home Ukraine – and in the children who are dying like them – is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed while trying to climb back into the shooting school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she tried only in her underwear to climb back into the school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Totally confused, Aida was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were deemed dead, but they survived.
“A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My legs were bleeding.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her safely.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she was completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'll have to have surgery again.
Some grenade splitters are still in my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people, as doctors have helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it didn’t break me,” she says.
“That’s what happened to me, and you can’t change that.
Once a year I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory becomes somewhat weaker each year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the picture of myself online as I go back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help make it happen again.
The boy who escaped through the bullet haul thought his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at age 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she might be dead, he ran away and saw a crying little child on the way, grasping it by the hand and fleeing through a bullet hail.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son outside in his arms, said, “Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara was stunned outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, assuming that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flew to London (from the now dissolved News of the World) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror is chasing you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's getting blurry in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard and they didn’t get it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open carriage.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends have suffered.
This horror is chasing you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'm so happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood have been killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
At the time, I understood how people across the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how Damir and I helped.
I remember Damir liked to eat Borschtsch and called her all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shot her with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
It was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They are just like our kids.
I think for many wars is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that’s so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
He does not seek revenge, for example, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes lay on the couch, his face turned away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to my legs, I looked around and saw hell around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember calling him, 'Damir, run, run away', but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Georgi Ilyin, 17
The boy whose horrific image after the siege became a symbol of the horrors of Beslan
Consolation: Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 siege, right a picture of Georgij today
His bloody face was marked by fear as he ran around his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had deferred him for his first day of school before she hurried off to bring her elder son Vladimir to university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not entirely alone, there was an entire family of relatives from us, but they were all killed.
Only Georgia was able to survive.
The closer this date gets, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always follow me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intrusive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was perpetuated as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgie wanted to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij does not like the picture, and it is hidden in the bookshelf at our house.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: “It is important that something like this can never happen again.
“I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never knowing the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused him?
This world becomes something awful.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing in this kind of pain.
It takes us dozens of years to forget about it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school in 2004 and was scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That’s why I always go to the gym when September 1st gets closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I will not have pity.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and attended a medical college in Wladikavkaz.
I'll be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to train in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won’t happen.
Georgi Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived even though he was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgi Faniyev was captured at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gym and sat next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," said Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service agent, but was unable to do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I’m older now and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences – I have to say that’s not true.
“In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the following year - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I've lost consciousness.
I will never go back there again and please don’t ask me to show you where I’ve been sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgiy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is immense and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think or talk about it and they never ask me after school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I couldn’t study at the FSB’s secret service academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical ones, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been there for two years.
He learns how to treat all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, “I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know anything about it and of course they should not suffer from it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the ceremonies to commemorate.
I know Georgia won't go.
It must be even harder for him because he was there and I wasn’t.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that he was given back to me.
It stays in us.
Georgia is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It’s hard to accept that when something like this happens to an unfaithful person.
He’s a boy who likes sports, but he can’t participate because of his knee.
He has been operated on several times, he can run, but does not exercise.
I would say that he has overcome the horror at 50%, but one can never completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and this only aggravated my pain.
I lost a lot of people that I knew well and that were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart weeps for the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who have never remarried.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on even if you don’t want it.
I will never forget how my heart leaped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are now fighting?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more will be killed.
If only we could take all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskayewa, 10
The baby, so grippingly carried by a special operations command in safety
Rescued: Aljona Tskayeva is safed by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelties at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the Beslan siege.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty kept their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, fled, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous pond.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana, which he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown up to be an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
“They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man Accused of Acknowledging Girls on Pedestrian Crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for the passing of a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of attacking a girl on the Pittenween transition in East Neuk.
The charge claims that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, dismisses the charge before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC launched the procedure in January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take photos or videos underwater, there is a choice of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3<0x2B> Silver Edition, both of which are available for about <0x24>300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all available at a price of less than <0x24>350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment two times.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery case and other compartments are tightly sealed.
Also set your camera to the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the dazzling underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is capable of functioning.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many will not fold.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images that action cameras usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see this underwater, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So you make a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a series mode that makes a series of shots with slightly modified exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the more you move away from the surface.
If possible, stay close to the surface when you make footage in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to bring more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the poor light conditions.
This is especially important when working with an action camera: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changed things, even in a giant organization like the NHS.
As a consultant anesthesia doctor, he devoted his career to saving the patient from both the agony of the disease and the suffering of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that diagnosis and disease were important to doctors, while those who were treated were mostly concerned with something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel it," he wrote in May of this year.
I had a hard time getting up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently accusing his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather do everything right away than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusually and unreasonably worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest.
It was only two weeks ago that he was skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray examination were expected.
He suffers from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest skin, that is, the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers have lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers in the past.
Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is a load of asbestos - contact with the fiber builder, which was once considered a "miracle" but was now recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily pledged not to use it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - clamps, construction workers, room workers and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it seems to be scarcely worrying nowadays.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is currently experiencing the height of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more mesothelioma deaths here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the plunder of Mesotheliom is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn, and the shops where we shop.
And so Mesotheliom knows no class constraints, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant shopping malls in London to private schools, are no shelter.
Parliamentary buildings are asbestos-contaminated.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be cured, we have already been the starting point of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a clamp either.
In fact, it was hard for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
“It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy’s Hospital, where I graduated for six years,” he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and doctors - use the tunnel.
You wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital, and who have suffered from mesothelium in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one still alive."
How many of us will still get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will still get sick?”
Professor Julian Peto, the UK’s leading expert on mesothelioma, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is expected to end in the UK, a total of 90,000 people will be affected.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they are going to die like this.

A brief look at the records of the courts, to which the persons concerned often turn for damages claims, shows how widespread the mesothelioma is already.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen was negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which is the flagship store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her M&S business.
Now she has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "asbestos form", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resilient and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is the most common asbestos found in buildings today.
It has been used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still considered by the EU and WHO as a "great health risk" with potential deaths.
However, more dangerous is brown asbestos (amozite) and blue asbestos (crokydolite).
The UK was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."

Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical Mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of the subjects, which shows that "a significant proportion of the mesotheliome without known discontinuation was caused by work or home probably by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can start to be sure.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which investigated Westminster Palace, shows how people, even in the heart of the government, could have been unconsciously exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service sheds and pipelines behind Parliament’s committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be inflamed by something as harmless as “strong air movements”.
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite is happening.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace has received a "clean health certificate", it is now undeniable that <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion of labor has to be spent over several years to renew the Parliament, modernize the electrical installations and re-center all-in-the-wall in 2015, and remove the asbestos in the West.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one knows if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbot suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos cases were positively resolved,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It’s so hard to remember all the places you’ve worked on and the data.
What he remembers exactly is the day in early December 2009, when he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he just had surgery late in the evening.
All of a sudden I had a frost.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt awful.
I didn’t think I could make the ride home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the chest, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
He didn’t go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took X-rays of his chest and used pleurakatheters to extract fluid from his lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after athletic activity and violent breathing.
In 2011, a patient with similar symptoms came into his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott does not associate this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had first felt sick, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cave between the rib and chest.
I am an optimist.
I usually just move on,” he says.
Honestly, I didn’t worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: “You told me it was mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to marry a lawyer.
It was only now that he understood the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who switched from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (such as Andrew Lawson) or eating in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war hospitals were potentially life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students put their broom burners on asbestos mats.
And it’s not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Schools as well.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Across the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, students have put their broom burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is often discussed on websites now.
And in the meantime, such innocent items in our homes as floor panels or shelves contain asbestos by default.
“It’s an industrial gift that’s included in much of our properties,” Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy’s Hospital, said in a statement.
In one case, the only contact to which an affected woman fell was the collapse of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you cut out your garden shelves.
The impact of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
“It takes a while to process that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, yes, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
“It was very difficult to record all that,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How long have I got?’
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
It was then."
Mesothelioma is especially domestical because it is our life-sustaining mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made up of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is stirred up and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the chest skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest skin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac doctor who switched to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The hospital, which Andrew Lawson suspects to have exposed him to asbestos, is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were also likely exposed to asbestos during their hospital training.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed by the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature, it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotly disputed.
Some people think it’s worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the chest," he says.
You don't come around with the knife.
In the meantime, the cancer "doesn't speak very well on chemotherapy," which "shows effect", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live longer, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man support and counseling office for those involved.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he happily introduced himself to calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that lasted four months and were expected to extend his life by only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
“We had an advantage because I didn’t have to be referred, I just called and got an appointment,” Graham admits.
A normal patient should receive a transfer and wait for the approval of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to implement the best available therapies.
But if these treatments ultimately inevitably fail, many affected are of another financial concern - about the future of the families that leave them behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health,” says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was recognized that even a very low load posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually endorsed their case, but it was not what Morgan called a "full compensation" as Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact with Guy's.
However, after an investigation into his death, a spokesman for Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How Asbestos Can Be Removed
In fact, for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation, it is a huge problem to assign asbestos to the deadly contact of a company or workplace – usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, this year, there were clear new legislations that make it easier for those affected by Mesothelioma to seek compensation even if their former employers are no longer available.
The law has set up a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million fund fund fund funded by the insurance industry for all who were diagnosed after July 2012 to prove a contact, but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have agreed to them in a normal damages process – about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan thinks, like so many mesothelioma affected, that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million is a "very good job" of the insurance industry.
“This is an insurer deal for insurers,” he says, indicating that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time hadn’t gone by and mesothelioma patients could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was “not perfect.”
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven deaths daily, rapid action was needed.
“People suffer so much and need help today,” Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect as opposed to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy, with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
“Of course, that’s the most important thing,” says Abbott.
This is seen again and again in patients.
There's something there that keeps you going.
If you give up, you're going to get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Post-care scans showed no signs of the disease.
I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's life-threatening.
Abbott again underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
There is no longer any trace of the tumors.
But the process is physically and mentally very stressful.
You need to think about practical things - about the money when I'm no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler setting works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my daughter that I had a disease that I wouldn’t get old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and unguesty.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma patients, such conversations are not permeated by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as in the end for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong’s right to government elections, protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, despite increasing calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament voted against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 election by the Hong Kong electorate.
This move is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists took the planning and mobilization to the streets within a few hours of the announcement.
The decision of the People’s Congress of China allows communist leaders to reject all non-Peking candidates.
“It’s not unexpected, but it makes us angry,” said Emily Lau, the president of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
People from Hong Kong have lied.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of China's decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the National People's Congress's Standing Committee, said the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom regained control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let its residents vote for the presidency from 2017 onwards.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct right to vote for Hong Kong’s citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership holds the process in hand through a closely controlled Beijing-controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates will be admitted “with love for the country and love for Hong Kong”.
The decision follows a summer in which some of Hong Kong’s biggest and most popular protests took place in several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shoot down the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine general right to vote.
On Sunday night, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong within hours of the announcement.
During the demonstration, the organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online announcement, the organizers announced that the movement "considered the occupation of the Central District only as a last resort, an action that should take place only if all the opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other option.
We are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and security measures were applied on Sunday in front of the government building, including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is heightened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their city.
The draw of people from the mainland increases the competition for products and services.
In addition, there is growing fear that Hong Kong’s values such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to break under Beijing’s growing pressure.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy Central Movement as they jeopardized the business operation - the life of Hong Kong.
“The protests they’re talking about could cause major economic damage depending on how many people are involved and how long they last,” said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to raise fears that Hong Kong will become out of control.
This impression is bad for investments.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported about the Democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the right to vote in which 780,000 people participated – more than one-fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of graduation balls in the U.S. is now being transferred to universities where Freshmen are offered performances by private plane.
We are excited to be able to respond to this demand and offer the UK’s first luxury travel service for today’s students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security party.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to spend their possessions in a dangerously overloaded car across the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesperson said there were no new bookings yet, as the service had just been introduced, but added that “students would book the service in the coming weeks.”
The company also announced that despite the <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 annual tuition fees, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as being dismissed.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education, said: “This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month are exposed to a crisis of living costs, as the available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep pace with the highly increasing bills for the simplest basics of life before they can even think of finding out how to do something like that for thousands of students.
Feminists Criticize Racial Issue and Police Behavior According to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they waited for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender in front of the race when it comes to addressing reproductive law and income inequalities.
However, as tensions in the Midwest rose and attention received throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers of white women turned 100% around the race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shootings, personal essays with titles such as "Thinks of Ferguson from a White Woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, that was an important change.
“I don’t think you can find many people in feminism who are white and talk about privileges in such a high-class way,” she said.
The people felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson raised problems that black Americans are exposed to every day but are not considered "women's topics" in the cultural space.
“I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colorful people in their own country are under siege, the silence is deafening.
“How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship but not about security in public space?” she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the themes clean; they live every day in combined reality.
While white women now combine race and gender issues in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lined up and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came at the point where white women who fought for women’s suffrage, such as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for the right to vote could only be successful for one group:
"They made the decision to endorse women's suffrage, and blacks' suffrage should come later," Hattery said.
When you remember such things, one with power becomes aware of why colorful women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize themselves against the Lynch in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to Ferguson's questions - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "capture" with the problems black women have been dealing with for generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception?” Mitchell asked.
Second-generation feminists, who have built their careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what that means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and posted a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist for the Guardian, in which she demanded more protests from white Americans on the topic of racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about the race that are clearly different in public surveys - will lead to the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for rather intersectional feminism, which addresses race as well as gender issues, some of her comments on the race theme in America are surprising.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on her stand in front of Ferguson
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police’s relationship with the black community is not the only problem that pushes itself into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. Border Police arrested nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country’s southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform also comes to the surface – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-thinking of the issue as an essential issue for women, they only need to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women accompanying them are in a position where they are prone to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a resurgence in women's organizations," she said.
"Pig house" in Ipswich for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
The details included an illustration of the living room of the house - which also included a pig that had laid his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was erroneously published and has now been removed," a spokeswoman for the company said.
In the House Exposé, Connells described the former Assembly House as a "unique single-family house with one bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house was of interest on social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
SW City Harvey Homes New Millionaire After Lotto Winning
A Harvey lottery player is coming this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner earning almost <0x24>1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the first division draw for the second time in five years, after <0x24>1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to sign up.
The store owner Steve Forward said the profits provided talk material in the small town in southwestern Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought that such a profit could come.
Eight WA winners celebrated wins in the first division last month, a deserving completion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a Belmont couple had just a few weeks earlier earned the <0x24>7.5 million mega-win.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said that winning allows them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly <0x24>85 million.
Leonidas in the Gladiator
Not only did the gladiators stand deeply in the match at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who resisted the rainy and autumnal cold and left themselves unrelentingly enthralled by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful array of performances, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance to the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial combat team of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial arts in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert presenter and sent his men in succession to the ring for a heroic duel in various Gladiator stories.
First, the "provocators" were on the line with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short sword and throw plant, as well as an iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who with throw net, Dreizack and Dolch went against the "Secutor", and after a short fight the boys fell to the ground.
There, the swords were metallic, the shields were created, and the jets flew swirling through the arena that a fear and fear could become about the health of the gladiators.
But on it the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, always had an attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era viable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the event "Circle of Friends Roman Channel", the intention behind the show.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became an "Oppidum Romanum" for a day, a Roman city, as deputy mayor Claus Wehage said in his greeting.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest into our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of these were also to be admired on the Roman day, for example, "aqueduct marble" from the 11-metre high and 1400-metre long Roman canal bridge, which stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus company once faced the water and energy supply, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: "We are still taking advantage of the knowledge of the day."
This is also confirmed by diploma measurement engineer Ralph Heiliger of the Rheinbach-Ingenieurteam Zwei, who presented the measurement instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the hot air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Also impressive are the footprints that were left by Wolf and Fuchs two thousand years ago in the footsteps made of tone before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Underground Care had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord commercial park in Rheinbach.
The walls of a commercial building were found with a dart for drying grains and for grinding.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural property, explained archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A series of found pieces from these excavations were presented in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a decorative necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
At her, the children also engaged in the Roman windmill game, similar to today’s mill game, or they wrote their names on waxboards, as the Roman pupils once did.
At the stand of the Roman Thermals Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, build glass mosaics at the stand of the Rheinbach Glass Museum and use a heavy stone wheat mill at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Center to grind the flour for a flat bread or a muesli.
With the original Roman travel car, drawn from two cold blossoms, the visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed by the impressive stand of the City Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also enter the Rhineland-speaking Roman year 2014, which is supposed to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the Home and History Associations, the Wachtberger Wander Association, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, among other things, a thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes will be offered and will commemorate the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary will be told about his work on the current Wachtberg, will present plants as living monuments from Roman times and will offer a funny lesson in understanding between a group of Wachtbergers "Germans" and drawn Romans.
The Adendorfer Primary School is dedicated to the Roman theme within the framework of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg will be re-experienced.
In the Wachtberger Town Hall, a small presentation will commemorate the founding of the Berkumer Matrone Shrine in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemic Is Loading West Africa's Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are gone – and international companies are going away.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is hitting the West African economy.
The harvest is rotten on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are missing - the virus has hardened the region.
Some international companies are already moving away.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one,” said Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is the most affected
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
All that comes to the market is who wants to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola.
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus, with more than 600 people suffering from the virus alone.
Recently, the health authorities declared that the disease was prevalent in every corner of the country.
Also in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, the virus has spread.
In total, more than 1,500 people have already died, thousands more joined.
Foreign firms are withdrawing employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries, companies are deploying their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are relocating their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
Domestic traders and farmers are also reacting: only a few merchants are still leaving their home towns to obtain supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia under quarantine, the cocoa and coffee beans important for export are rotting on the fields.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food will be scarce
“People will travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert on the West African economy.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
Therefore, the population gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food becomes scarce.
In the markets, the supply of basic foods such as rice disappears.
At the same time, the region heavily dependent on international companies is threatened with image damage – with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest risk is that international companies will basically avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of French think tank Iris.
It is crucial to know how far and how long the virus will continue to spread.
Investors may have the impression that “it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest,” Hugon warns.
The disease also burdens the tightened state budgets of the states
The disease also burdens the state budgets of the states concerned, which are anyway tightened.
The rating agency Moody’s fears that their budgets will be severely tightened by the high spending on the health system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with <0x24>60 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 million).
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few cases of Ebola have been diagnosed so far.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta is not affected so far.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home because of fear of infection.
Bookings in hotels also go down a lot.
Protecting her 50th Anniversary
The Protecting Association "Tannenwald" Bergau celebrates its 50th anniversary from September 12th to 14th.
On high-rise tours, the Tannenwald Protective Association prepares for the 50th anniversary of its founding from 12 to 14 September.
On Friday, September 12, a great evening of entertainment with the group "Dorfrocker" is planned.
On Saturday at 6 p.m. is the big shot.
Then in the large party tent is the mood evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzenbuam".
Blaskapelle provides music
Highlights on Sunday are the Feast of the Lord and 9:30 p.m. in the parish church and the great festivities at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon there is also the award distribution of the Federal and Gauss shooting.
A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 party ladies with their dirndln.
The main chapel is the Blaskapelle Bergau.
The patronage was taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schutzgesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when on 21 March the association for "social entertainment by means of exercises in room stud and small calibration" was founded.
The NS regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who on April 30 at Lukas' hostel lifted the "new" protectorate "Tannenwald" Bergau from the baptism.
Karl Marz and Adolf Ried led the club through a difficult starting period, when it was primarily about finding a club premises and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein started in the hostel "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes until the 1st Gauliga.
The club’s records rose annually and the magical limit of 380 rings was first reached in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of active shooters has increased, the number of members has evolved positively.
After the club premises "Leininger" no longer satisfies the demands of a modern protectorate, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future home in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work of 2,700 hours, on May 8, 1988, the parish priest Strasser granted the ecclesiastical blessing for the new shelters.
One of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gauss shooting, associated with the solemn dedication of the new Shield Flag in July 1991.
On April 23 and 24, 1994, the Association of Protectors celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A Böller Group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became the Boeller Referent.
A major challenge for the "Böllers" and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the Bavaria Böller meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association modernized the premises and the shooting facility in the Bernauer Hof last year, bringing it to the latest level of technology.
Eleven teams in round competitions
You can also see the sporting achievements of the club.
In total, eleven teams are currently participating in the rounds: six air gun teams, one air pistol team, one sports gun KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose from the Gauoberliga (highest league in Schützengau ANB) to the district league 1 in the 2013/14 round.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml rose from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting, events such as bowling, cheering and royal ball, club outing and Christmas celebration have a tradition.
With this, the patrons are also at the feasts in the parish and the church.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident when he returns to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre placed in round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
Team boss Chad Johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed, but is now focusing on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
“I wish we had a better deployment and a better result for him,” Johnston said.
We go to Richmond and hope we can make it better there.
Stewart had previously been driving in the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch into a wall and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I got into a good result today with pretty good hopes," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart’s car was loaded into the tractor and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ash racing in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week and either win in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the pursuit.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities said on Friday that the investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made on whether Stewart will have to face a charge.
The three-time champion was welcomed with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start in 12th position, Stewart was in the top 10 shortly thereafter and was temporarily fourth.
After a restart in Round 122, Buschs
Carriage with No. 18 out of control after exiting curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both carriages driving against the wall.
Stewart went on, but fell back to 21st place.
Looking for a happy dancer
Just try it: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to fellow fighters.
Like many other associations, the jazz groups in TV are also making full-time lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now, enhanced offspring is sought for a sport that is healthy and has great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, a former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve years old, six in the group of twelve to 15 years old," the 20-year-old says.
With more assets, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreographies," she says.
If you are interested in dancing, on Thursdays between 5 and 6 p.m. or on Fridays between 5 and 6 p.m. in the dance hall at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, you can enter the training hours without obligation.
"The training begins regularly with a warm-up program," the coach says.
Thereafter, different choreographies are taught.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classics to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, societality is not too short.
"We also go out to eat, watch dance movies and we've already spent the night in the dance room," says Lisa Neutzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
For those who don’t like jazz dance, they can also tap into one of TV Jahn’s other offers.
Children and adolescents can always take part in classes in the areas of children’s dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, videoclip dancing and hip-hop on Wednesdays.
The dancer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Anyone who likes Discofox, Slow Walzer, Viennese Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango can watch and participate.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organised a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a demand list to be discussed with Interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and demanding a return to the previous 24-hour layers.
Despite the meetings between the prison workers’ union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the National Bulgarian Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations continue, the Director General for the Implementation of Penal Measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov told the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union association of employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has given up Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters are still on the move.
After heavy fighting, which allegedly included Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army today abandoned Luhansk Rebellion Airport on Monday.
At the same time, the army announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership, without giving any details.
Pro-Russian separatists shoot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists have again shot down a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the insurgents told Russian agencies on Monday.
Ships of the Coast Guard sank
The insurgents also claimed that for the first time in the Azov Sea two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard had drowned.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships had been fired on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told 112.ua.
Two crew members were deemed missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had placed several villages in the Donetsk region under their control.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
Today, in the Belarusian capital Minsk, the Ukrainian contact group meets.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to make public announcement of their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adhered to the 1997 NATO-Russia Council founding agreement.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a crushed breach" of the agreement.
“Today, we need to take into account the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side show that “they regard us as opponents”.
Strengthening NATO Presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he wants to strengthen NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as necessary," Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute, according to official data.
Negotiations are set for next Saturday, Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
The European Union is still awaiting a decision on whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Because of the gas price dispute, Ukraine has been getting no more fuel from Russia for weeks.
Last week, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supply to Europe.
Europe produces about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel says "Maut" will be "all clear"
Now the Chancellor has made it clear.
But it is not a free letter for all the complicated details.
The CDU's persistent concerns about the car-maut have been overwhelmingly appalled by the CSU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a powerful word from her CDU after persistent resistance to the introduction of a car-murder.
"To be clear, she is in the coalition treaty, and she will come," the party chief said on Monday after meetings of the CDU's summit bodies in Berlin.
However, Merkel did not first look at a detailed model.
In the black-red government program are called "specific parameters".
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has "made a proposal and is now working on it".
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no to a fine on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also working constructively on the negotiations for a bill.
Beyond the topic, he also talked to Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, for example in broadband development.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is testing its own concept to reward highway investors with revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing Maut concepts against the prime minister in the cabinet.
CDU Federal Visa Officer Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
“The coalition treaty never relied on covering all district and federal roads,” the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU chairman said.
So it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to talk again about the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU land associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
Background are fears that a coup affects small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded loyalty from ranks of the CDU coalition because of the criticism.
The Left considers the plans to have failed in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks death is dead," party chief Bernd Riexinger told the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads to start in 2016.
Domestic car owners, however, may not be additionally charged under the Coalition Treaty.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the mortgage via the car tax.
However, according to EU law, the model must not be disadvantaged by foreign drivers due to their nationality.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few more years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She has actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT), a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK said that misdiagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsafe walking and curved toes.
Patients also suffer from deafness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms will get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from peaceful ataxia (FA), a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she was 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same as the others.
I fell down all the time and everything lasted longer with me.
I was never able to ride with the other kids skate or skateboard and was often haunted at school because of my kind of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretching her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA Society,” she said.
When I got the answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would be in the wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in the meantime I would slowly lose all my abilities.
I did all this alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, it became clear to her that her abilities had not decreased as strongly as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair right now."
I think you're a little less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, her CMT was found.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of this disease.
Stafffeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a firefighter since the closure of the former troop training site
For almost a decade, the former troops training ground in Münsingen is no longer being shot.
Nonetheless, deadly ammunition still occurs every month in the heart of the biosphere area of Schwäbische Alb.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be blown up on site.
An ear-deceiving buzz stops in the blasts over the heartpiece of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen troop training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6,500-hectare area is the core of the biosphere area of Schwäbische Alb, which is open on 13 designated trails for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden on business people in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rates for companies in the country rose slightly last year, as economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia combined paid <0x24>27.6 billion to state and local agencies in fiscal year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over 2012 revenues of <0x24>26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of companies rose 4.3 percent last year to <0x24>671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent the previous year, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining modest 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to a study conducted by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from corporations.
Virginia earns the lowest tax revenue from companies with 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is based on a recovery in the property value of companies, the researchers say, leading to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of these profits came from major states such as California, New York and Texas, the run-up seems to apply to the Washington area as well.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over <0x24>10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to <0x24>9.6 billion in 2012 – an increase of 4.2 percent over a year.
But the apparent recovery in property values in Maryland is not as effective as raising state and local tax revenues, as property taxes here amount to just over one-fifth of corporate tax returns.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
“In Maryland, the following is happening: a large part of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that don’t pay property taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to be able to offer the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery in the real estate market
Company revenues also appear to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on state organizations of <0x24>2.3 billion compared to <0x24>2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland collected <0x24>1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is moving in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an under-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income tax rates in all three departments, with 6 percent (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high at 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia demands lower state and local corporate taxes and a better tax climate overall than Maryland.
The district was not investigated in the study.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate by 2017 to 3%.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they therefore pay more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen – a transitional structure according to which most small businesses are organized – in the district, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent last year to <0x24>2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate in the companies.
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxation across the country will likely continue this year, with an increase in general VAT revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Still, the Washington area could be backwards if the federal government’s cut in spending has an impact on the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer has an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, baked in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - this is the urgent desire of officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery settled in our city," said Li Yiwei, the vice-secretary of the Southern Chinese metropolis, this week, during a visit to a SPD delegation in his city.
Over and over again, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China returned to this question of the twelve-million-metropolis.
Guangzhou, also called the canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, warb Li.
Therefore, people also possessed the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would be interviewed in Germany after a possible partner for the project.
"For beer it doesn't take much: good water, grains and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party ober in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiates Mr. Li, he whispered to the host.
Then the official from Guangzhou came up with a shepherd's goblet - but with red wine, which was served for food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brass art.
Tsingtao beer is baked according to the German Purity Order.
More Business Traffic
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Li, deputy party chief.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but in 2012 it was cancelled for economic reasons.
“It would be worth it again,” the communist politician said.
"Business traffic between our two cities is growing ever more".
At the moment, travellers had to take the journey over Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, the capital of which is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The vice governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire at the forefront of his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"That's a very good idea," replied Schäfer-Gumbel - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, agreeing.
Maintained Partnership
The strange vice-chairman of Guangzhou hopes he can visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already in the lead, but not yet in this role.
He only came into office this year after his predecessor was expelled from office on corruption charges.
Local party chief Wan Qinglian had to go, too.
The move against officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is being toughened by President Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Prior to his tenure in Guangzhou, he worked as a senior official in Fujian, where the automaker VW built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially signed more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9,000-kilometre-distanced Guangzhou belongs to those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese Connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Perl River is almost as strong as Hesse with its economic strength.
Next year, it wants to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Joan River's family "presses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days since she was admitted to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter has shown hope today that the 81-year-old comedian is recovering from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We're all pushing our thumbs.
According to sources, her mother was delivered to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency due to a cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sites, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
More stringent environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that come on the market from today onwards.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1 to allow the buyer to detect central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars, sharper nitrogen oxide values apply in the "Euro 6" class of pollutants.
In addition, there is more money for the structure builders: they will receive a uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros nationwide.
Amazon to Buy Twitch for <0x24>1.04 Billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported Monday morning: The online retailer — and video producer, and a variety of other things — is buying video streaming service Twitch for <0x24>1.04 billion (<0x24>970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a acquisition of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service was decided for a cool billion, and the collaboration also appeared natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravo pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which the (mostly older) plays give a touch of secret science theaters, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often referred to when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was recorded somewhat boring, a textbook example of an established tech company buying a potential competitor.
It’s a puzzle why the deal with YouTube didn’t come true, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about it right now is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: “We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster.”
Another secret, to be honest, is Twitch’s incredible success.
For snobs like me who explain that they prefer to watch sports than to watch it, it’s hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching others play instead of taking the control console into their own hands.
It’s one thing to look at a friend over her shoulder at 3:00 a.m. as she goes through Resident Evil, and something completely different to watch a spinner shoot him 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
All of these games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast-paced processes in which the Roger Bannisters complete all the games of our electronic age in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is no game or humor, its Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth-largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch being integrated in Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube Twitch could have swallowed it.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are being promoted as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinkage, not even - swallow - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest on Sunday night.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the strong rainfall on Saturday night, an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-air party in the Burggarten.
The entrance had to be stopped temporarily.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt wedge l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem form the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to radiate brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This happened early in the evening, when the first visitors to the Open Air.
A celebration for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And they succeeded.
Around the grocery stores on the Burggartenwege, salt sections had made themselves comfortable, but also guests from the nearby and further surroundings.
They followed the first live performances, whipped with their feet in the rhythm, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: relaxation pure and enjoyment were fashionable.
And that through the generations.
While one was lapping on decks on the extra-carved white sand at the beach bar, others were lapping on a wine quarter in the wine cellar, the offspring were lapping on the hippburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in the case of children’s makeup, the volunteers, in the truest sense of the word, had all the hands to do full to become the Lord of the Andrang and to enchant imaginative creations into the little faces.
The larger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop directed by the Goodfoot Crew made of salt wedge.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 p.m., he threw himself down on the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
However, the attractiveness of the festival did not interrupt.
“There were more people coming than expected,” said Ron Sem, who spoke of a “success across the line.”
That is why there is nothing against the repetition of the big party in the coming year.
While the content and size of the event still needs to be worked on, Sem made it clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday to the people’s voice.
As annoying, he noted that the entrance had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little force.
The result: some who had already paid for it did not come to the site anymore.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who were tumbling in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The salt-sweetened hip-hop band Blocks`n`Rox disbanded their performance, so it was disingenuous.
The technicians were unable to create a semi-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be constructed because the tents could not be brought to salt springs due to a tyre pan.
“But next year they will be there,” the organizer said.
The Amula Open Air premiere was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will be forgiven the first time, but must be eliminated in the second edition.
Even on the social network Facebook, the organizers have to be critical.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier said on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you took over a little bit," says Elle Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems so closely.
I find it very good that some not only stupidly quatschen, but also really try to put something on their legs.
Hat off!", writes Stephanie Jens to Amula.
Now there is a year left for the organizers to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmarks shrink
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready-made part is waiting to be used in the distinctive structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the creation of the space observation radar TIRA, the shell, the so-called Radom, will be completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller than the old one with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
The size is still a world record.
The last step to complete the new cover is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new envelope is set up.
If the weather is good, the action is expected to go over the stage earlier this week.
Participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge Releases Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from the UK cried so much when her cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This ice bucket challenge went painfully next to it.
A woman was taken to the hospital after she cried so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she broke her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts of the United Kingdom was so circled when her cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did, my jaw just stood," she told The Mirror.
Ice water will be shaken over the age of 20.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn’t work, the jaw was deaf, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw this too and almost got into their pants before laughing, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the United Kingdom was taken to the hospital to get her chin back in after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle associations soon retreat to a strand?
Lastly, there was repeated dispute between the two Wolfratshauser castle associations.
Now the board of directors are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the castle union and the castle-friendly Wolfratshausen.
To date, the views on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and a possible reconstruction seemed quite different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks about a common approach are to be held soon.
Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper confirm this.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could get together one day," Sjöberg said.
In his view, all members of both clubs could in the future pull back on one strand.
Thus, it is easier to record visible successes.
While the castle friends around the sudden deceased Richard Dimbath had until recently contemplated a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, Sjöberg’s castle association is the “opening and enjoying” of the site.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, said he was very pleased with the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has faced the castle friends.
A new chairman is expected to be found in a member assembly in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the club's activities rest out of respect. This "thinking phase" was necessary to "consider how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new president will then go to talks with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also make a current mood within their grouping.
There is no candidate for the presidency at the moment, says Piffl.
"But I'm sure someone will find himself." He doesn't want to run himself because he has his home in Bad Tölz.
The new president should be a tungsten houser.
The Tölzer wants to "but very much like to work on the project".
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He honored Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the rebuilding of the castle.
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
With a high participation of the population and volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was skeptical at the beginning, too.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to drive the project forward." A "only-entertainment feature" could be created for the city of Flößer.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be funded by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I don't want to just throw the idea of reconstruction on board." He hopes that the castle association may be moving at this point.
Their goal of documenting the story first is "important and good".
After that, you can see more.
Clever ways to save on Uni textbooks
As the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than <0x24>1,000 a year, fast-paced second-time student Matt Schroeder thought of a clever savings idea.
He invented a lease system for books by students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book usually costs <0x24>180, but I got it for <0x24>10 for a semester and a chicken-fil-A-Keek," said Schroeder, 19, who attended Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him <0x24>430, he said.
He spent <0x24>120.
The college management said that on average, students spend more than <0x24>1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but there are different cost mitigation options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookshops, said the lease of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in college bookstores were rented last spring semester, Neebo’s vice president Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost only a third of the price they have to have online at the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost <0x24>290, but can be obtained from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for <0x24>239.99.
Buying used
If you don’t care about the notes of other or normal usage tracks, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is for <0x24>93.49 on Chegg.com.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for <0x24>48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors if previous issues were permissible.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest expense.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com by eBay Inc is a popular alternative to used books.
Leasing
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them somewhat well, remember to return them and don’t want to keep the books after the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent “calculus” for the duration of a semester for about <0x24>20.
Please be informed about the terms and conditions of the rental business, including the penalties applicable to the writing of notes, substantiations or traces of use.
Careful tenant: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of conventional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a specific period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about <0x24>61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals, as many classics can be downloaded for free today, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Anyway, look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon attend the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for pricing books, so you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order should be checked, so Gault, whether the book is actually available.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" hasn't become a cashier
Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables 3" recorded less than <0x24>30 million of his <0x24>90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Lady to Kill For" only recorded <0x24>12 million of his <0x24>70 million budget.
The film "Sex Tape" tailored to Cameron Diaz only earned <0x24>14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Dragon Takes Easy 2" also disappointed in revenue.
An article by telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in children’s films could be the reason for the film itself.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films and described "Dragon Counts Easy Made 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, when it comes to films for a slightly older audience, it seems like the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for each summer film launch, which was shown on at least 2,000 screens between American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics and suggest that this year’s film hits are equivalent to last year’s.
Some commentators believe that the development of changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web-streaming services such as Netflix are due.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-to-be-released Jungle Book movie, told Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
Unlike the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently achieved revenues with streaming content of <0x24>1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, with revenues of <0x24>837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comic films and prophecies about a "core melt" of Hollywood.
In light of the current slowdown seen, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy could contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash battles expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
X-Men's producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in cashier earnings as simply "cyclical" and told Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema at all, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
When, a few years ago, the 2nd table tennis district class was removed for the purpose of penalizing the league division, that was a step in the right direction.
Now the Deutsche Tischtennisbund has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the program.
The result: those who have not ascended are descended.
For example, Göttingen’s top-class team Torpedo in the Oberliga relegation has avoided the decline, but only plays fifth-class in the coming season.
Four-class Torpedos ladies remain in the regional league despite their grandiose progress.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony league, just like the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo reserves are joining the new league, in which the Landesliga is no longer represented by Göttinger clubs.
With the ladies, TTV Geismar plays in the league, the Torpedo-second in the national league.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new Southern District Sovereign League.
Here join TSV Seoulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC.
In the district league play as regional representatives of Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The women's district supremacy league starts at least in Sollstärke.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Nor is the SCW's district league staff - Torpedo II is still starting there - complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly established regional league, the two Göttinger Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the West Staffel are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the Eastern Staffel, Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen are among others.
The Women's Circle League consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemelen, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no more women’s teams at the district level.
Noting that none of the six 2nd Circuit Classes reaches the target strength, the innovative and agile Circuit Board will have to think about it.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter-terrorism summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments for us over the weekend and spoke to demonstrators who traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flying out of the Blue Mountains
TWO young bush hikers were taken safely by rope after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govetts Leap in Blackheath for their tour.
Worried relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search call from local police and rescue services broke out and the couple was found near Bridal Veil waterfalls around 23:00.
The girl had been injured on her knee and the man had fallen and had his head smashed.
Rescue personnel stayed with the couple overnight, and they flew out on Monday morning.
They were delivered in stable condition with a ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Anti-government protests escalate in Pakistan
Around 1,000 protesters were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
After about half an hour, the transmitter resumed the broadcast.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged the equipment in the editorial office.
No deaths or injuries have been reported.
The protesters are demanding the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said about a kilometre from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s residence on Monday there were again clashes of around 3,000 demonstrators with security forces.
According to the hospital, a policeman was injured.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured on the weekend when protesters tried to advance to Sharif’s residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and using no violence" after a meeting in the military headquarters on Sunday night.
The statement added: “The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state in its role.”
The escalating violence has raised concerns about a military intervention that has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have been ongoing since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to persevere.
“We will not go back without Sharif being forced to resign,” Khan said.
Qadri said the same thing.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning parliamentary elections in May last year by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are being deployed to protect the government district.
The protesters had initially stood peacefully in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to advance to Sharif’s residence over the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after second season win in third place of the table.
With the 2-0 over Grüdig for Rapid, a bitter week on Sunday has come to an end.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate level with the Aus in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who took the third place with green and white.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to Victory Road Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second season’s victory and is going to the country game with a successful experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said outfielder Thomas Schrammel, who with his glorious sixteenth-minute leadership volley set the marks for victory.
"I thought I'd clean up all the fruit from Thursday and sniff it under the latte," the 26-year-old said with a smile.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesliga party on 13 November 2010, that was still for Ried.
The first championship match in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me, it's something very special, I'm from the rapid growth," Schrammel said.
Due to Mario Pavelic’s short-term pool injury, Schrammel moved from left to right on the defensive side and did his thing very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position mirroring.
The goal he has earned, he has already done some assists," Barisic lobbied.
The team showed Character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after well an hour, which ultimately brought the decision.
The guests would have been able to write before.
"Thank God we've had some luck today," Schrammel also noted, referring to the clash between performance and result over the past weeks: "The results have not voted, but the player's performance has always been good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that he was "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season."
The first three points since July 26 have therefore proved that the team is intact despite the rebounds: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
Not less pleasant for him: “That we finally played to zero again.”
A lot of work during the country game break Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger, several failures are to be regretted, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their debuts, making the victory worthwhile.
"You must not forget that," warned Barisic, who has lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "which have been very stable lately."
The country playoffs must therefore be used to "leak the balls and add a little bit in the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21 pickers in his ranks.
One to whom the break probably comes in a special place is Captain Hofmann.
He's breaking up for the team, he's going through pain.
In this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic said.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his replacement in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who finished his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first match out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admiral).
Hofmann: "Don't think everything's okay now" "We've probably had a bit of luck too, but someday luck has to come back to us too.
It’s time,” Hofmann said.
He freely warned of concentrated further work: “You can’t always see that in black and white.
We haven’t played as badly in the last few weeks as it has been shown.
But we must also not believe that everything is good now.
He could not argue the importance of his role for the team.
It’s a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
At some stages, they stick to me,” Hofmann said.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to do with himself and his team.
He regretted the rapid counter-attack "from the category of magical gate", as well as the regular gate of use in the 40th minute that had been unfairly denied by arbitrator colleagues.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we weren’t concrete enough towards goal in some phases.
We had too few conclusions.
Interior defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started just as badly, but then we found it clean and even made a gate.
In general, there would have been more.
Under this whip there is peace
We showed a powerful tribe at our puzzle issue of the summer series "My piece from the Rhine Happiness" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants are still in the county, the specimen depicted is the "Geisterruhe" above Unterweissbrunn.
A hiking trail leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It passes by clusters, basalt stone clusters and basalt stone seas.
A piece below the stone bridge from Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it extends beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and is reminiscent of an American mammoth tree with a range of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree trunk suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only indications of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bischofsheimer Archives and asked seniors from Unterweissenbrunn to find out what it has to do with the Geißruhe.
The result of his investigations remained the rather naked explanation for the name.
Accordingly, until about 80 years ago, goats were supposed to have driven their animals from Unterweisenbrunn to the weary, stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the animal guards, exhausted by the ascension, should have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because on the meadows, goats are actually grazing again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further found out.
However, you should be careful when entering the stone collections, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place to stay for cruisers.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweissbrunn to the tree, but it is somewhat hidden.
Further routes are marked, ascending towards Hochrhön and inviting you to an extensive hike.
Where is the Wasserburg?
However, a water castle, which is sought for in our next task, is more rarely found at the height.
The mirror in the tomb already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the county, to which the building contour could fit.
Where is our "Piece of the Rhine Happiness"?

After a week of resignation, Italy’s Prime Minister and current EU President Matteo Renzi passed last week on the appointment of its Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as Head of EU Foreign Policy, being succeeded by the British Cather.
Renzi considers, as the near-government newspaper La Repubblica repeats, the appointment of Mogherini, who is also a favorite in the government team, to strengthen the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his “reform package” in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm the left-wing base against him again and again, because Mogherini is assigned to him - albeit rather in a moderate way.
With regard to the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the nominated Polish President-in-Office Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion in Rome will be drawn up to make a political settlement.
The EU’s chief diplomat will simultaneously be the deputy of Commission President Juncker.
The remaining approval of the European Parliament is deemed to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is spreading the optimism that Mogherini, who has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and is known for her ambition, will show itself to be growing the "enormous challenges".
The born Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
She started her political career in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which in 2008 merged with the Catholic Central Party Margherita for the present-day Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the election in 2001 to the Left Democratic Party, she joined the party's top political party, worked in the foreign policy department, which she soon became the head of.
It occupied traditional focuses of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on NATO deployment in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, maintaining contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the House of Representatives, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he referred Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party’s over 40 percent of the votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share of it.
The reservations in Brussels, the new EU Foreign Office has too little diplomatic experience, therefore lack of substance, is being countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini’s mistrustful realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being pursued and defamed as a “Russian-friendly course”.
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas will be transported directly to southern Europe, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi took office as EU President in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hand were taken in Brussels with indignation, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief to a Milan economic summit in October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an Azubi who has already completed another training in the company.
The new employees will be employed in four training professions: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickle and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg in front of the forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgefrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd, and Ferdinand Streunz from Tebl.
The new trainees had previously visited primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, trainees of all ages and trainers travel to Oberammergau for a team training event, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting at the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees in Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees across all courses is 27.
The socialists in France should “keep their mouths shut and put France in order,” said Francois Hollande’s main ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show his "love" for the contested socialist president, whose cabinet reform has hit a disapproval among the vast majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain on his side," he said with great applause.
The Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce demands for a loosening of the regime by Emmanuel Macron, the new economic minister.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his co-socialists to "align themselves" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, squeezed Sand into the gear in which she appeared at a meeting of more reluctant socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking on the French "belief in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the constant digs of the Socialists and said she could not imagine the new Valls government going to last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not survived a summer.
"And the new one will not survive either autumn or winter," Mrs. Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party’s reputation after a dissolution of parliament and said she was confident that she would emerge victorious in the forthcoming elections and be ready for the government.
France’s ruling party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Holland’s term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and record unemployment figures.
“There’s a small window to possibilities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Norwegian Cruise just ahead of a <0x24>3 billion deal with prestige cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NKHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise provider, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about <0x24>3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of <0x24>6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises as well as its wealthy customer while with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp.
A deal could be announced this week, sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to be able to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesperson for Apollo declined a comment.
The Miami-based Norwegian Cruise company operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenue in 2013 was <0x24>2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of <0x24>1.2 billion, an increase of 6% compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals around <0x24>29 billion and is expected for the next few years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise providers for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises filed with U.S. regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a <0x24>850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested <0x24>1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
At the end of June, Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares, and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises jointly account for 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the entry into the stock exchange of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A Beijing loyal group swinged near the Chinese flag.
The National People’s Congress’s Standing Committee on Sunday passed a framework law that allows only two or three candidates to run for leadership in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied by Beijing-owned members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be admitted to the polls, causing pro-democracy activists to realize their threats and looting Hong Kong’s financial square with Occupy Central protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears that the call for democracy will extend to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which outlined China’s dominance over Hong Kong in June, Democrat activists held an unofficial referendum on the election process in the special administration region, in which hundreds of thousands marched in the city’s business district and organised a sit-in there.
Li’s interview is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Connection Office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Permanent Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Office of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be questioned during the day.
Student activists announced that they would meet in the afternoon in front of Hong Kong’s executive branch office.
Until the end of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong, Britain had no democratic elements.
Putin calls on Kiev to hold "state talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media reports on Sunday, demanded that the Ukrainian government stop the fights against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately resume negotiations on the "statehood" of the rebel region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the territory under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that his status towards Ukraine would have to be redefined in order for the Russian-speaking region to have the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin's appeal to the Kiev government to negotiate at eye level with the pro-Russian insurgents corresponds to the strategy apparently pursued by him five months ago since the start of the outbursts: aid for the separatists in the capture of territories, and re-opening of Russia's territory, with Russia's pro-Russsian influence on the Western Ukraine.
In an interview with the state television channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the territories held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow seized the Ukrainian peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossija" or "New Russia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary glossary of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the October 26 election and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the territories held by separatists are hoping for soon peace talks "captured in their illusions".
"We must immediately engage in detailed talks, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state of Southeast Ukraine, in order to protect the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to statehood must be seen in a context with greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership, in order to spread fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights would be compromised.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman for correcting the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's leadership's claim in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, in which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would be much more difficult to annexe the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the pre-conflict period resulted in a broad majority for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy discussed by Russian diplomats at international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, and thus give the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian territory with the Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region of Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and castings, which make important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his inaugural speech on June 7 that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider additions to the constitution, which allow the respective territories to have greater control over their finances and the status of the languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armament and upkeep is being prosecuted by Moscow.
Putin’s last call on Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level followed a further advance by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Asowian Sea.
The separatists backed by Russia took control of Novoasovsk, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations are underway to fortify Mariupol, a steel-industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday, calling for actions to prevent a further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just ahead of a point where there is no backwards," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership called for the draft further sanctions against Russia to come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to retreat from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Forces (NSA) in the city of Kyiv.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers detained by the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers who were captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Naked photo scandal about Australian promise and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Noble did not make a heel about his rage over hackers who allegedly stole nude images of his fiancé Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who the A-Promis from Hollywood.
The film city is excited after a series of unique photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence appear in a hacking scandal over promising online.
The hacker in charge of the hack probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, Star from "The Tribute of Panem" and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Greco from Melbourne have also reportedly released private photos due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 promises on the list.
The noblest, who had been engaged to Greco last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and shared with others.
Greco, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was “horrible” and that the affected people felt “injured”.
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two footage in which she is lying in a pool without.
Palmers' films include "Love is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked images.
A spokesperson for Lawrence told TMZ: "It's a hateful breach of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in a tweet: "Publishing hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing but the sale of lighting."
Legally speaking, the further dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger and Wanderer attended the 8th Rally on the Großer Feldberg yesterday and thereby supported the association "Help for Cancer-Kids".
The tour, for which one was a torture, was an easy training for the other.
But in one thing, they all agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus was riding his bike on the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle cage, especially since his participation in the 8th cycle on the Großen Feldberg in favor of the association "Help for Cancer-Kids" (Frankfurt) also brought him valuable insights in person.
It's a great thing.
"Now I know I can do that - okay!"
Small pauses on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the upper city parliament, many of the 718 participants came to the mountains yesterday in the early afternoon and came close to exhaustion, but happily on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, made it easier to overcome the 11-kilometre route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The all-in-red green politician from the roundabout - red dress, red bike - did something on understatement at the start (“Every lot of professionals, there’s the target!”), but then turned out to be half-professional on the mountain and went through the target after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also went the route in a slip, as did Nina Kuhn, a press spokeswoman for the city of Oberursel, who had joined Frank Grüneisen on the way.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we would love to be with it - a trip we would have made today anyway," said Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to the upper spring in the morning to tighten it back to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swinged into the saddle at 9 a.m. at home, "doing" the Feldberg twice, then rolling home with fun.
He also had fun with "Fritten-Toni".
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk cycling tours over the Feldberg are just one of them.
He had played for 40 minutes on his 6.5-kilo-run bike.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist".
He must have been, because he was on the road with the "Fixie-Bike", which are also race bikes, but without circuit...
Not only did the 20 hikers who climbed above the white wall and the hump to the summit prove that it went up smoothly without a wheel, but also a jogger who pulled a car tyre with weights behind him on a cord.
Bergwacht-Doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with all-wheel-bully and quad, ensured safety, said: "I know" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sliding trail, only that he pulls the sled himself.
The 718 participants – and thus as many as never before – had been sent on the route in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf dem Großen Feldberg", gave the start command and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that he will be able to block the route up to Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
