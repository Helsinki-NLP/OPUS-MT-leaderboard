They play behind the house.
I don't know why I'm still bothered.
I'm not as powerful as I used to be.
Tom's dog had a few blinds.
Don't forget, Tom's blind.
Mary seemed to be getting married.
No dissputing against the taste.
When Tom returned home in the evening, he found that there was no dinner left for him.
He knows them.
I'm sure they're too proud of their daughter.
Tom turned to the right, and Mary went to the other side.
There's one left.
He began to explain what had happened.
Tom's got a cast iron stomach, and he can eat almost anything.
The mother did not know what to do with her son.
He knows wine.
Tom felt like someone knocked on his shoulder.
Do you know who the parents are?
There's no word to express how amazing you are.
I'd like fruit juice.
Will it rain tomorrow?
The Kline font invented by the Sumerians was used in many languages in the ancient Middle East.
I love summer, but I can't stand the heat.
Of course I do!
Mary loves you.
What do you want?
What does TATOEBA mean?
Where have you been all afternoon?
You found a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her dirty hands before eating.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left a high splash on the table.
It's not over a glass of beer after a full day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
So far I am satisfied with my work.
Do you really need help?
Being you, I'll ask him.
Leave it for us.
Here's a map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting even though I was invited.
Hey, are you still here?
I thought you were dating Tom.
I have to get out to the next station.
The dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you've paid a lot for it.
Tom's obviously lying.
So right and then right and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'm still gonna have to call you.
Tom says he wants to win.
Tom's gonna be thirteen tomorrow.
Cut the meat into thin slices.
I can't watch him ruin his life.
Do everything with consideration.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
Yes, you must.
We reached the top of Mount Fuji.
My wife and I want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember what she was like?
That belt's too tight for me.
Playing a fagot is not easy.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom weighed in on the subject.
We drink a lot of beer here.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it to Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
The old habits are dying out quickly today.
Tom's still got a lot of work to do.
You'd better leave right now.
Tom is childless.
I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I don't like to interrupt you, I just came here to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because there was a fallen tree on the tracks.
What did Tom yell at the crowd?
He's the perfect husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a party in costumes from the seventeenth century.
Are you satisfied with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I used to admire Tom.
He climbed a tree with great effort.
Translating the Czech text is very difficult.
Tom's probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom stood up, too.
We already know that, Tom.
I'm glad you warned me about it.
I missed breakfast.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skills qualified him for this job.
The circles are falling.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't hesitate to tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They're not helping.
I like that tie.
We didn't behave as well as we would have liked.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you argue with Joana?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The sky is covered with black clouds.
I need it more than you do.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll stay here forever.
Tom's got a slippery slope.
What should I do in this situation?
Are you going to school by train?
Tom's not going to school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who is Tom visiting?
It's Tom's fault, not Mary.
Why don't you invite me to a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
She's married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I won't be surprised if that happens.
He's free.
People don't normally say that.
Ask your mother.
Tom washed his feet very carefully.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was as happy as a blister when she got her recording contract.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time at his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you'd help us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He's visiting his uncle.
They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary did.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in a place like this?
It's been going on for two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Have you ever sang in French before?
I'm used to this cold weather.
The Americans surprised the Germans.
There are not enough chairs in the conference room.
Tom hasn't recovered.
I told Tom he was a fake friend and he was offended.
Peru laundry.
This bridge was a billed bridge.
He was talking to her.
I'm late for school this morning.
I participated in the search.
I went straight to bed.
We shot on the lawn by the river.
Tom never drank hard alcohol.
Tom doesn't like to work.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know which one.
Tom took Mary by the hand.
I'm quite happy myself.
You did what you had to.
We need to understand that we are still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played tennis with Mary last night.
What's your father's name?
There was a half-brown wall.
I spoke English to him and found out I could make a deal.
Tom had to run.
I see the book.
Did any of you ever talk to Tom?
You should apologise.
The fence is freshly coated.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You're fat.
We're supposed to win.
All answers must be written according to the instructions.
Answer me the questions you're asking.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and didn't come back.
Did you bring the book?
I dare not open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother is from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting divorced from her.
I bought one of my bags.
Do you know where your father comes from?
What are you?
Did you do that, huh?
There were no doubts at all.
This letter is personal, I don't want anyone else to read it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Stand up there and you'll see it better.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we got a stroke of laughter.
Tom's wrong, right?
Better to be dead than to live red.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you did it for me.
Tom knows what he wants to say.
The wedding took place last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse's roasting.
I borrowed Tom a cliff.
I'm bored.
I'm writing my will.
I'm no longer that sticky.
You won't believe what Tom just told me.
Mary has no one to talk to, but she doesn't feel lonely.
If it's not raining tomorrow, we'll go to the castle.
Try talking to the police.
You like elephants.
I don't want to change anything.
Barman, I'll get you a drink.
Do you like strawberries?
She was bigger.
I guess he's gone home.
I was in the woods.
Tom was drunk.
He asked me to wait there before he came back.
I made a terrible decision.
I'd rather go back inside.
She doesn't have to.
I know she's pretty.
I don't go to school on Sunday.
He has his own house.
I usually don't do it tonight.
Why do you want me to ask them for help when we can handle it ourselves?
I was expecting them to tell the truth.
Put it under the hood.
I'm so glad you're here.
You're gone.
Tom didn't want Mary to lose.
Tom's home.
Throw the ball to Tom.
I'm insulting her.
Was the police involved in this?”
We like children.
I wish I was a better person.
You're stealing, aren't you?
Tom's gotta get his hair done.
You should consult with a lawyer in advance.
You're a good journalist.
Tom is used to it.
I love this book.
The waste is clogged again.
When I got home from work, I found out that someone stole our apartment.
Read this book.
This used to be a bakery.
My father runs a restaurant.
You're really boring.
I like German movies.
This is working.
Let him go.
I'd like to make more money.
I know you're still not happy.
Could the message be true?
It's easy, it's easy.
Do you remember that you've seen me before?
I want to help, but I'm busy right now.
Without her help, I would never pass the exam.
You wouldn't be happier about anything if I told you.
Can you translate from French to English?
A lot of people were waiting for him.
Tom said Mary didn't plan to go swimming with us.
Oh, my God, Tom, what the hell is this?
The promise seemed overlooked.
If you need any further information, please feel free to contact me.
When you get here, I'll be asleep.
I don't know how old Tom is.
I'd like you to come with me.
I told Tom it wasn't over yet.
Judy likes him.
Tom and Mary met John.
Please don't do that.
You'll be happy again.
The baby was walking around four.
Tom doesn't take his medication.
"Didn't you see my phone?" "It's on the table."
Tom went to his closet.
The first jump went wrong.
Well, let's have lunch.
We should give him some gift.
In England, the waiter asked us, "How many beers would you give, half a pint, or the whole?" Since we had no idea how much that might be, we asked him to show us the glasses.
I'll tell Tom to cut your lawn.
I'd rather speak English than music.
I like fish.
They're all yelling.
Tom's parents supported him during his studies.
It lacks a sense of morality.
If you're in any trouble, don't hesitate to come see me.
He's rude and unskilled, and people take him away.
He was killed by Laila himself.
You're a splinter.
He's too self-confident.

He's drunk.
He threatened to kill her if he didn't obey him.
I'd like to be in Paris now.
You remember that?
I live in Turkey.
I don't want to disappoint my friends.
Mary is a very busy woman.
I don't know anything anymore.
Frozen and thirsty, we finally reached the hostess.
It's not important, is it?

You're a good cook, aren't you?
I just wanted to say thank you.
Who's gonna pay for it?
Don't give up hope.

I think you could help me out.
Can you update our programs?
He can't be hungry, he just ate.

Allow me to help you.

It's too early to go to bed.
They let Tom wait a long time.

I don't want to go to school.
Make sure you don't get on the wrong bus.
