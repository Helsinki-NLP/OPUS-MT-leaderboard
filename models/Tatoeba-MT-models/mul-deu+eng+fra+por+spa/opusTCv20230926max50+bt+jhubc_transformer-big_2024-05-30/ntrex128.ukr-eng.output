Members of the Welsh Assembly Worried About “Associating with Mappets”
Some CHA fears the recommendation to change the name of their position to a “member of the Welsh Parliament” (MWP).
This recommendation came from plans to change the name of the assembly to the “Parliament of Wales”.
THE whole political spectrum is concerned that this can cause laughter.
A Labour Party spokesman said that his group was disturbed by the Romans with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "unthinkable" and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
CHA from the Party of Wales said that his group as a whole was "unhappy" and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservatives said his group was "unprecedented" about the name change, but noted that MWP could quickly become a "mappet".
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to change names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be taken by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Self-Government Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public discussion of the proposals, and the rename of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament received widespread support.
As for how to call CHA, the commission proposes to call them “members of the Parliament of Wales”, that is, WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest public support.
Of course, the CA offers alternatives, but attempting to reach an agreement could cause problems to President Elaine Jones, who is due to submit a bill on the change within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes regarding the work of the assembly, including the rules of detachment of the CA and the structure of the committee system.
CHA will hold a final vote on its new name when discussing the legislation.
Macedonians Go to Vote for Referendum on Change of Country Name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The vote was organised with the aim of resolving a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens have long claimed that the name of their northern neighbor is a claim on the territory of Greece, and have repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes holding a referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a price that needs to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silent because the Churches of Harlem are experiencing difficult times
“The old people I’ve been talking to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
Now there is neither one nor the other.”
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
“Today, people are socializing differently.
The bars are no longer the local living room they go to on a regular basis.”
As for churches, Adams fears that money from selling assets will not be as long as leaders hope, and “sooner or later they will be where they started.”
Churches, he added, can be replaced by houses with condominiums, and there will be people living there who will not help the shrines that remain nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white,” Adams explained, “so it will accelerate the day when all these churches close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will become their home.”
Both churches were built by white communities even before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and Saint-Martin — ten years later.
The core white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The Black community, which held the rites nearby, got the right to own the building.
Saint-Martin moved to a black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street. These merchants did not want to hire black people and serve them.
In 1939, the fire severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners wanted to restore it and set up a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert, who played at the Carillion in July, called it differently: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who 18 years ago switched to a larger carillon in the Church of Riverside.
According to Mr. Merriezer, he was not found a replacement in Saint-Martin.
What is happening in Saint-Martin in the last few months is a complex story about architects and contractors. Some of them were attracted by church leaders, others – the episcopal diocese.
The Council – the governing body of the parish, consisting of the leaders of the parish – wrote to the diocese in July that it was concerned that the diocese would “try to pass on expenses” to the council, while the council did not participate in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the parish.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy Who Came Following Lobsters in California
According to officials, on Saturday, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him. The boy ran after the lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season.
The attack took place almost at 7 a.m. near Biconi Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been dancing with friends for about half an hour when he heard that the boy was calling for help, and along with a group of swimmers went to him to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a catch about the caught lobster, but then realized that the boy was yelling, “I tasted it!
I liked it!”
As soon as he reached the boy, he saw that his key was completely broken.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: ‘A shark is in the water!’”
The boy was taken on a screwdriver to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told a news briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the tulle.
For the purposes of investigation and security, the authorities blocked access to the beach for 48 hours from the beach of Ponto in Casablanca to Swami in Ensinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using islands with cosmetics similar to those in the stores. Work on the islands will be qualified sellers.
As part of the enhanced entry into the British market of cosmetics worth 2.8 billion pounds (continues to increase at a time when the volume of sales of clothing and household goods decreases) the islands are increased by other islands with cosmetics, the country will be tested in all 11 stores.
Investments in cosmetics are linked to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space that was previously used for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it will double its range of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range will gain more space: there will be branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also updates the range of Boutique cosmetics: now most of the products presented will not be tested on animals, which is increasingly demanded by young buyers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop is testing its trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, northern London, last week, and the second will open in Selly-Ouck, Birmingham, later.
Online shopping and the transition to buying small volumes of food every day in small stores forces supermarkets to make additional efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said their stores will become more like the universe as a network of supermarkets tries to counter Aldi and Lidl discounters with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's are opening Argos departments in hundreds of its stores, also opened a number of Habitats departments. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claim that this increased the sales of food products, as well as made both networks more available.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to upgrade the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals department ended in failure.
Sainsbury's was tested in collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over how to split income from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business (281 pharmacy) Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We have changed the appearance of our cosmetic islands to make the atmosphere more pleasant to buyers.
We have also invested in specially trained consultants who will be able to give advice.
The range of brands we present is designed to meet any needs, and the pleasant atmosphere and convenient locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is a competition for the old way of buying.”
Peter Jones 'repents' for Holly Willowby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
"The Dragon League" star Peter Jones "reluctantly" because TV presenter Holly Willowby has left the deal with his brand of goods for life (the cost of the deal is <0xC2><0xA3>11 million) to focus on new contracts with Marks & I Spencer
Willowby doesn’t have time for the brand of homewear and accessories Truely.
Business couples were associated with the brand Goop Guinness Peltrow.
The 37-year-old manager of This Morning has announced her entry to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby brought the Dragon League star Peter Jones to the fore when at the last moment she left their lucrative business of goods for life to focus on new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "excused" by the Golden Girl on TV when she confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of the Jones business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new deals were worth more than <0x24>1.5 million.
This business was linked to the Goop Guinness Peltrow brand and was meant to double the Willoughby line, which is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was with True, Jones left the UK to go to one of his vacation homes.
The source said: “Truly, without a doubt, was Holly’s top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to leave the business shocked all the parties interested.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, almost the day before the launch.
The headquarters in Marlowe is full of stuff ready for sale.
Experts believe that the entry of the leading This Morning, which is one of the UK’s highest-paid stars, could cost the firm millions due to large investments in commodities (from pillows and candles to clothes and homewear) and create a cover.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willowby's mother of three children and her husband Dan Bolduin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Kapp for ten years.
Willowby and Capp formed True in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the board in March.
The couple spent the holidays together, with Jones holding 40 percent of the shares of Bolduin, a television production company.
Willowby will become M&S's ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
The source, who approached Johns, said last night: “We will not comment on his case.”
A hard conversation, “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for a comment that someone would consider “non-President” as well as for a very positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump take such great actions?”
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news leader.
I didn’t do any actions.”
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have gone into a deaf corner.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s leading diplomat, Ree Young Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “responsible response” from the United States to its first decommissions.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues sanctions aimed at supporting pressure.
Speaking at his rally, Trump was much more optimistic.
“We have good relations with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have such a wonderful relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of U.S. military personnel.
He also defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this battle-filled stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds dead
In particular, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has been affected, the national disaster has not been declared, and this is a prerequisite for international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it’s a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
Although "Save the Children" gathers a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign staff will be able to work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Reduction Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Given the fact that earthquakes are constantly occurring in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for the anger of nature.
In the province of Aceh, tsunamis are built, but they are not characteristic of other coasts.
The apparent absence of a siren warning about the tsunami in Palla, although the warning was effective, probably contributed to the deaths.
Moving between the many Indonesian islands is not easy even at the best times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A medical ship that was in Lombok for the treatment of the victims of the earthquake is sailing to Palu, but it will be possible to reach the site of a new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Uidodo has made improvements to Indonesia’s infrastructure the basis of his election campaign and has increased costs on roads and railways.
But the funding deficit has created problems for the administration of Mr. Joko, who plans to reopen next year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by the continued interfaith hostility in parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have died, tens of thousands have been evicted from their homes as a result of clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using mosques, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Starridge from Liverpool scores a goal from the depths of the field and equals the bill from Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the Premier League with his 89th-minute goal on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge received a pass from Jordan Shachiri, when he was at a distance of about 27 meters from Chelsea's goal. At this point his team lost with a score of 1-0.
He threw the ball on his left leg and loaded it in the direction of the long rod.
The ball flew high above the penalty in the direction of the upper right corner of the goal.
He flew over the jumping Kepa Arrisabalaga and fell into the gate.
“It was just an attempt to take that position so as not to waste time. Players like Shachiri are always under attack as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Starridge told Liverpool FC.com.
I saw Cante approaching, and I made one touch, I didn't think too much about it and just took the ball.
Chelsea scored 1-0 after the first time, in which Belgian star Eden Azar scored in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the Blues handed the pass back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, rotated in the middle of the field and quickly ran for half of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly played in the wall in the middle of the field.
Then he made a good penetrating pass, which brought Azar to the penalty.
Azar rounded the defense and made a decisive kick with his left leg in the net of the long rod. The ball passed past the goalkeeper "Liverpool" Alison Becker.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at São Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths from earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Indonesian agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people remained trapped in the ruins of buildings destroyed during Friday's 7.5-point earthquake, which caused waves at a height of 6 meters, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a press secretary of the agency, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, was shattered by the demolition of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
The investigation into the murder began after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson-Mouse, John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called for people to respond who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan commented, “The investigation is now in its early stages, but I ask anyone who was near John Street in Burkehead who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have taken something on the video recorder, to contact us as the information on these videos can be very important for our investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the house.
Today in the afternoon, friends who think they know a woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they are currently informing the nearest relatives of the victim.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Muse, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to enter the house and exit it.
When he found out what had happened, he lost his gift of speech.
Now the residents are told that it will take hours before they are allowed to return home.
Someone heard the policeman tell one man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
There was a woman in tears at the scene of the crime.
She repeats, “It’s so horrible.”
At 14:00 two police vans were standing behind the fence, another van in front of the fence.
Several policemen were standing behind the fence and tracking down the multi-apartment house.
Anyone who has information is asked to write a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously call Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and call code 247 and date 30 September.
Cromwell's statue near Parliament becomes a new monument that suffers from "rewriting history"
The removal of the statue would be a payoff for the Taliban-style destruction of many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts, carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Community called Mr. Crick's proposal "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Community, said: “Given the current debate on the removal of statues, the fact that the statue of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace would become a target was inevitable.”
The iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was not carried out either by Cromwell himself or by his command.
It is likely that Cromwell will not deserve to be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The grand statue of Cromwell by sculptor William Hamo Torneycroft is a testament to the mood of the 19th century and part of the historiography of the post, which, in the opinion of many, is still to be respected.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many, probably more at the end of the 19th century than now, consider Cromwell a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether such an idea is quite accurate is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the well-known posts that represents one side of this conflict.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are also worth noting and respecting.”
Pig killer kills Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by the surname Yuan, was found dead in his blood with a broken artery near a pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
In Xinjiang, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig is going to vaccinate pigs in a pig’s nest.
It is reported that on Wednesday he left with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his brother found him dead and saw that the door of the pighouse was open.
The brother noted that there was a large cabin in the pork with blood on his tooth.
Forensic medical examination confirmed that the 249-kilogram cab killed the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were in the blood and distorted,” said a cousin of the victim’s surname Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera footage showed that Yuan went to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Juana or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that when the police collected evidence at the scene of the incident, the pig was locked up to prevent her from attacking people.
It is reported that seven Ioannina and the market administration are discussing compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing a critical injury to her husband.
Ten years before that, a pig weighed 295 kg kept a Welsh farmer pressed to a tractor until the farmer’s wife scared the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs were usually not aggressive, but the taste of the blood could become a “trigger.”
“They’re just playful.
They're like children, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with due respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rose will bring extensive rainfall to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rain with rainfall to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rose had wind speeds of 137 km/h (this is Hurricane Category 1) standing at 5 a.m. east time on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a wetland that moves east to the western coast of the United States begins to form over the Pacific Ocean. When on Monday Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push a strong storm in the U.S.
On Monday, Rosa brought up to 25.4 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next in the coming days, the tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching slope, will create strong precipitation in the southwest.
In this area from 2.54 to 10.2 cm of rain will be caused by dangerous floods, garbage flows and the possibility of shifts in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will lead to an increase in the number of places to 5–7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5–10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in the significant territory of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapid deterioration due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We strongly recommend not to go to the desert on foot, because possible tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can make the canyons stormy rivers, and storms will bring here destructive winds and dust storms.
Approaching the wetlands will cause heavy rainfall in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The number of precipitations can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause unsustainable flows of garbage and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and Monday morning, and in the evening on Monday and Tuesday the rain will become more extensive.
Heavy rain will pass over For Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature drops can be observed throughout the U.S. as it gets colder in the Arctic, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to sharp temperature drops at short distances.
On Sunday, you will see a great example of sharp temperature drops in the central part of the United States.
It is a nearly 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will try to come back and spread again.
It is expected that the U.S. region will be warm by October, and the temperature from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Celsius.
Temperatures in New York could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees Celsius above average temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high likelihood of surpassing average temperatures in the eastern part of the U.S. in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched a hearing in the Brett Kavanaugh case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television networks watched the exciting testimonies of the Supreme Court’s candidates Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blaise Ford, the woman who accused him of rape in 1980.
The political confrontation has continued, channels interrupted scheduled programs to report on Friday’s latest news: an agreement prepared by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake on a one-week FBI investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his emotional testimonials that he was 100 percent sure it wasn’t.
It is quite likely that more than 20.4 million people watched this on Friday, according to research firm Nielsen.
The company counted the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not immediately possible to get the numbers on other networks that also showed the hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems with measuring the number of people watching TV in offices.
For comparison, such an audience in size is similar to an audience that watches a game of the play-off series or an Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose show’s leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was a leader among all channels during the whole day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake became the central post of Friday's drama.
The office of this moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh. Then on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras recorded how protesters were screaming at Flake when he was trying to take the elevator to the hearing.
He stood with his eyes relaxed for a few minutes, during which he was lamented, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I stand right in front of you,” said one woman.
Do you think he is telling the truth?
They said to him, “You have power, and many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had published a statement and, before the elevator closed, added that he would say more at the committee hearings.
All cable and broadband channels aired live hours later, when the Judicial Committee was due to vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination for a full-fledged vote in the Senate.
Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI would consider charges against the candidate next week, which is required by a democratic minority.
Flake was partially convinced of the conversations with his friend, Senator Democrat Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns, and then with several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had an impact because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to nominate Kavanaugh's candidacy without an investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May Accuses Critics of 'Games in Politics' Around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to exit the European Union of “playing politics” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview, which came along with Teresa's interview on the first page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called Brexit Scheckers plan, saying that he was proposing Britain and the EU "to stand up for one."
Who shot Weed Sims: Police Arrested Dayton Simpson for Suspected in the Death of a University of Louisiana Player
Police arrested a suspect in a shooting that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana.
Dyton Simpson, 20, was arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities have posted a video of a dispute between Simpson and Simpson, and police said Simpson had lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the affiliated CBS TV channel WAFB, police removed the glasses from the crime scene and noted that Simpson’s DNA was found on them.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had confessed to shooting Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was awarded a bail of <0x24>350,000.
The office of Colonel East Baton Rouge on Friday released a previous report stating that the cause of the death was a fire in the head and neck.
The Department expresses its gratitude to the special department for the search for fugitives of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
Sports Director of the University of Louisiana, Joe Alleva, thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their “anxiety and aspiration for justice.”
Sammy was 20 years old.
Forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the University of Louisiana.
Last season, his average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 picks.
On Friday morning, University of Louisiana basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "destroyed" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“That’s what bothers you all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes on Mexico
Populus, which ejects the Popocatepetl volcano, reached the southern areas of Mexico's capital.
The National Natural Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday called on Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as activity began in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The center monitored numerous noises and push-ups.
The photo on social media shows thin layers of ash on the windscreen of cars in the surroundings of Mexico, such as Hochimilko.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, following a 7.1-ball earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police met with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of voting for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters, who advocated independence, collided with the special police department. Thousands of people joined the demonstrations of the protesters to mark the first anniversary.
A pro-Separatist group in masks, which were detained by special agents, cast them with eggs and powder paint, which created dark clouds of dust on the streets, on which usually full of tourists.
The clashes took place later that day, the police used sticks to deter the aggression.
A few hours later, a group of supporters of independence, who chanted, “We will not forget, we will not forgive!”, met with supporters of the country’s conservation, who shouted, “Long live Spain!”
According to the local press, fourteen people were assisted in the light injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which is recognized by Madrid as illegal but is celebrated by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region that seeks independence remain high.
Voters mostly voted for independence, but the vote was low, as most of those who voted against the partition boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police attempts to stop voting in polling stations across the region.
Independence groups spent the night in tents on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to go another route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia could gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of joy that they could vote, but now we’ve come into a deaf corner,” he said.
Despite the vital, but very difficult victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan parties, who advocate independence, were unable to maintain the momentum this year, because many of their best-known leaders are in good condition or are in good condition.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a protest in support of police on the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is getting stronger,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in search isolation since the end of last year, announced that he will vote for the European Parliament next year.
“The status of a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we observe from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car Enters House <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after the car entered a home in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place at Ballinagard-Crescent on Thursday at 7:30pm British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Bloomings noted that the gate and the house were damaged.
It is quite possible that at some point the car was shot from the arbaletta.
Mengy's strike secured Liverpool a victory over the Rangers with a score of 1-0
Dolly Menge's first goal in Liverpool became a winner
Upgraded in the Livingstone class stunned the Rangers and brought Steven Gerrard the second defeat from 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menge's strike proved decisive: Gary Holt's team rose to one level with Hibernian in a second.
Gerrard's team won no wins in the Premier League this season and will play with the Harts leaders next Sunday, from which she is eight points behind.
Earlier on Thursday, the Rangers will take "Rapid Vienna" as part of the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues its invincible move to six games in the division, and head coach Holt has not yet suffered a defeat after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
“Livingstone” misses the chances offered by non-smokers.
Holt’s team was supposed to be ahead of them long before they were shot, because their straightforwardness creates the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but made a knock along the gate, then Alan Litgou broke through the gate after squeezing and accepting Craig Halkett's knock along the gate that he made head.
The masters were pleased that they allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, while they knew that they could cause problems for guests from the standard positions.
This is how a decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers missed the free kick, and the Livingstone made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson engaged Meng, who took the ball and shot from the center of the penalty.
Prior to this stage, the Rangers dominated the ball, but the defenders of the field proved impenetrable to them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly did not bother.
This tendency continued in the second tie, although Alfredo Morelos was still able to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's kick was kicked by the leg of the Rangers Allan McGregor. Litgow hit the side of the gate in another standard combination of "Livingstone".
The hangings were constantly invoked by the Livingstone Penalty and were constantly neutralized, and two applications for a penalty — after Halkett’s attack on Glenn Middleton, who was in substitution, and for the hand game — were rejected.
The phenomenon of "Livingstone": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony McCarron Arena Stadium
The phenomenal game and result of "Livingstone".
They all played well together, they continued to surpass expectations on this ascending trail.
Their style of play and composition remained virtually unchanged after returning to the highest level, but should be credited to Holt for how he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played grandiosely, organized the defense very well, and Meng forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to be constantly on guard.
The Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
In the past, they played very well under the leadership of Gerrard, but now they do not reach those standards significantly.
They didn't have the last ball - only once they broke the defense of the field owners - and it was something like a wake-up call for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was unambiguously accepted in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, there was a smile and a blue sky.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
Among them, there have been some controversy on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters of the president still showed up nearby to see him.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — have also made themselves heard. They condemn Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests show the ambiguity of the guest, which some German Turks called a hero, and others a dictator.
Road accident in Depford: a cyclist died in collision with a car
The cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Beestudd Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the Deptford area in the southeast of the city at about 10:15 a.m. British Standard Time.
The driver stopped, and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died after the driver escaped from the scene of the adventure on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the Saturday accident.
London police said they were working on identifying the man's face to inform his closest relatives.
Travel is prohibited and bus routes have been changed, motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Injured in Disorder
Six prison workers were injured as a result of riots in a men's prison of a strict regime, the prison administration said.
The riots in Her Majesty’s Long-Laurent Prison in Wustershire began around 9:30 a.m. British standard time on Sunday and are still ongoing.
To stop the riots, initiated by eight prisoners and located in one wing, a special unit "Tornado" was called.
The officers were given medical assistance in connection with the minor facial injuries received at the scene of the incident.
A spokesman for the prison service commented: “In order to resolve the incident that lasts in Her Majesty’s Long-Laurent prison, specially trained prison personnel were involved.
Six of the employees received medical attention in connection with the injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and the duration of their stay behind bars can be extended.”
In Her Majesty’s Long-Laurent Prison there are more than 500 prisoners, including the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was sent for stationary treatment after the attack on the prisoner.
In October last year, a special police department was called to the prison to stop serious disturbances, during which inmates were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sailboats (dried territories may benefit)
Tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but it can happen at the beginning of next week, as the remnants of Hurricane Rose flow through the southwest of the desert, creating a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of flooding on Monday and Tuesday on the territory from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, and Flagstaff.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will be raining on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Hurricane Center, in the area of Mogollon-Rome in Arizona is predicted from 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and places up to 15.24 cm of rainfall.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Pool, are likely to receive from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of rainfall, places possibly up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of flooding, the Rose rain can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these floods are likely to be useful as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring center, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought, weather.com reports.
Firstly, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to shifts on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, is still in the grip of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 19.3 km/h.
The storm meets with cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
Thus, it is expected that with the force of a tropical storm in the day or evening, a hurricane on Monday will cause a shift in Mexico.
The number of precipitations in some parts of Mexico can be significant, which creates a significant risk of flooding.
“The total number of precipitations from Lower California to northwestern Sonora is expected to range from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, with locations possibly up to 25.4 cm,” says weather.com.
Next, Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will continue through Arizona and late in the evening on Tuesday to reach southern Utah.
“The main dangers that are expected from Rose or its remains are very heavy rains in Southern California, northwestern Sonora, and southwestern U.S. desert,” reports the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening floods and waste streams in the deserts, as well as shifts in the mountainous area.
Midsomer-Norton Attack: Four Persons Arrested for Attack on Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after they found a 16-year-old boy with knife injuries in Somerset.
The wounded teenager was found in the Exelsior Terrace area of Midsomer-Norton at about 4:00 a.m. British Standard Time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in stable condition.
The 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old men were arrested at night in the Radstock district, police Avon and Somerset said.
Police are asking to respond to anyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh “Passed the Silence and Anger” of the Democratic Party
“The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had “tendered the brilliance and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the expulsion process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, reluctantly and emotionally denying the accusations of Christine Blaise Ford that he had sexually abused her several decades ago when they were adolescent.
Ford also testified at the hearing about the allegations she had filed.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, “the American people saw the brilliance, character and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is the voice for one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, a lawyer with impeccable public service experience,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president fugitively mentioned the expulsion of Kavanaugh, when he spoke of the importance of the Republicans appearing in the medium-term elections.
“In five weeks, there will be one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don’t run, but I really run,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump claimed that the mission of the Democrats is to “refuse and hinder.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, a CNN aide from one of the Republican leaders said.
Hundreds of people died from earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of casualties increases
At least 384 people were killed, many drowned in the ocean when giant waves hit the beach as a result of intense earthquakes and tsunami on Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, the country's authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) in the evening broke down on the shore, killing many and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after the earthquake with a force of 7.5 points.
“When a threat of tsunami occurred yesterday, people were still engaged in their affairs at the beach and did not immediately begin to run away, and they became victims,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian agency for the elimination of the plague.
“It wasn’t just tsunamis, it moved cars, trees, houses, it hit everything that was on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coastline, tsunamis passed through the open sea at high speeds of 800.
To escape the tsunami, some people went to the trees and survived, he added.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
In the air photographs published by the disaster elimination agency, it can be seen that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been reversed and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
The riots in the coastal town continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have contributed to the force of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho called the damage "a large-scale" and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the debris of the destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the casualties and injuries could be more than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastline north of Palu in the area called Donggala, which is closest to the earthquake epicenter.
“The communications lines were completely damaged, and we did not get any information from Donggal,” Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, according to the statement of the Red Cross, and it is also added that its staff and volunteers went to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can become much bigger,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received widespread criticism for not reporting the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time indicated in the warning.
On amateur footage, which people shared on social media, it is seen as a man on the top floor of the house shouts crazy warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, the wall of water crashed into the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious power outage, which disrupted the connection around Palu, which made it difficult to coordinate the rescue actions.
Military personnel began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but evacuated people still very much need food and other essential items.
The city’s airport was opened only for assistance, and it will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths from tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala safely arrived in the city of Palu, where they hid in brass tents installed in the courtyard of their office, but along the way they saw scenes of desolation, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he said.
That's very bad.
Even when aid groups began decisive action to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with extensive experience were not allowed to go to Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian rules, the financing, supply and provision of personnel from abroad can only begin if the place of disaster is declared as a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened.
“It is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Auliya Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we will be able to accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been granted.”
The second night had already landed on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, and the friends and families of those who had not yet been found still hoped that the appearance of their loved ones would be a miracle that would decorate these dark plots of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was taken from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers found a woman lying under the stone for two days with her mother’s body next door.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paraplane team, trained two missing paraplanners to participate in the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paragliders who were trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandaga, were his disciples.
“As an elder in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon says hours after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel, which has spread among a community of paragliders, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to Palu’s rivals who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one grey dot, not double blue dots.
“I think that means that the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole <0x24>26,750 while filling a ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the robbers stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink employee who ran an ATM at Newport on the Levee, the Newport Police Department reported.
The driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was ready to add more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the news.
While he was busy, the other man "runted back to Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money intended for replenishment.
Witnesses noted several suspects who fled the scene of the crime, according to the news, but the police did not indicate the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about these persons should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Canyon West: the rapper changes his name to YES
Reper Canyon West changes its name to YES.
On Saturday, announcing a change on Twitter, he wrote: “Earlier officially known as Canyon West.”
The 41-year-old West has been called There for some time, and he used this abbreviation as the name for his album, released in June.
The change took place on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
On the show, he replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled his participation for “emotional reasons,” the show’s author said.
It is not just an abbreviation of the current professional name, West previously said that the word has a religious content for him.
"I believe that 'it' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am us, I am us.
The canyon, meaning “one,” has been shortened to simply “There is” — it is simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
Canyon is one of the few known rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Deddi, P. Deddi and Grandpa, announced this year that he had chosen the names of the Lion and the Lion Brothers.
A former West colleague, Jay-Zi, also experimented with deficiency and capital letters.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador promises not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use an army against civilians. Soon the country will mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody execution of students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised to “never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military fired a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people. At that time, the left student movements began to be established throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who are studying, and to open more free public universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education lead young people to criminal groups.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China increases its artificial intelligence activity, the U.S. needs to double the amount it spends on research in the field, says KI-Fu Lee, an investor and practicer who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about AI, although there is no formal strategy for AI in the U.S. at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to become the No. 1 in innovation in the field of AI by 2030.
“A double budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all the other countries are far behind the U.S. and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next major achievement in the field of AI will be made in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "States of the SHI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was printed this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Sinovation Ventures Foundation, which has invested in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of the most renowned companies in SHI.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie-Mellon, he worked on the AI system, which defeated the best American player in Otello, and later served as executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee noted previous competitions with technologies conducted by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when the next will be to help identify the next prospective participants.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China taking academic leaders, it’s corporations,” he said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring lights from universities to work on AI in recent years.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. increase efforts in the field of AI.
“I believe that the Green Card should be offered automatically to science candidates in the field of AI,” he said.
The State Council of China published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations spend money to American researchers, while providing the quality of academic robotics.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
As for the National Science Foundation, he is now investing more than <0x24>100 million a year in research into AI.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislature, which sought to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any steps in a few months.
Macedonians Vote in Referendum on Change of Country Name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which will resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim on its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the deal claim that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovak majority in Macedonia.
President Georgie Ivanov said he will not vote in a referendum, and due to the boycott campaign, there are doubts whether the voters will reach a minimum of 50%, which will allow the referendum to be considered valid.
The question in the referendum’s bulletin reads as follows: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries that formed after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay for accession to institutions such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska.
Although the result of the vote does not have legal obligations, enough members of parliament have said that they support it to make it decisive.
To change the name, two-thirds of the votes in Parliament will be required.
The State Election Commission said that no reports of the violation were received until 13:00.
However, the nomination was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their bulletins.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old Ghose Tanevsky in the capital Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumitz, Macedonia, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Dusko voted in a referendum on the name of the country that will open the way to joining NATO and Europe.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and placed chairs in front of tents organized by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud head, not through a service door,” Kavardarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership will bring a lot of necessary investment into Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority of our citizens vote in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He noted that the “yes” result would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies, between 30 and 43% of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required statement.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the referendum must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since the beginning of its work in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes all of Brighton's defense and scores goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling passed the defense of Brighton and brought Manchester City a 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero’s goal in the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the consecutive.
He ran between the three defenders of the Brighton and was in an open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He circumvented one defender, then ran several more on the edge of the penalty "Brighton".
Then he made a pass on the left, seeing Sterling.
The English forward made his first touch on the penalty shootout to give the ball to Aguero, who with his right boot kicked it to the right side of the goal, defeating Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some leg problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed that he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at this point.”
But the initial preference for the blue sky in this Premier League match was provided by Sterling.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the territory of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along the left flank to Leroy Sanne.
Leroy made several touches and continued to pass Sterling in the direction of the long rod.
Forward of the Sky Blues dropped the ball at the goal just before sliding out of the line.
The City will meet Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhine-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to pick glasses in “Roses”
Since the Washington Nationals team came out of the playoffs, there were no significant reasons to wait for another start.
But inclined to rivalry, Sherzer hopes to go to the pitchery gorge on Sunday in the game against "Colorado Rokis" provided that "Rokis" will still have difficulty getting out to the playoffs. Now "Rokis" on one game in the front of theApocalypse
"Roxies" have at least a wildcard for a win with a score of 5-2 over the Nasionals on Friday night, but still strive to consolidate the title of the first division.
“Despite the fact that we’re playing for nothing, at least we’ll be able to leave the ball knowing how the spectators are doing here in Denver, and the other team will probably play at the highest level I’ve seen in all the year.
Why wouldn’t I want to be part of this struggle?
The Nasionals will still announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but it is reported that they are inclined to be the Scherzer.
Shercer, for whom it will be the 34th start, held a pitting session on Thursday and can play on Sunday, his usual weekend.
The Washington Left scored 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's Meetings in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The president fugitively mentioned the situation around his nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the Republican supporters appearing in the medium-term elections.
“Everything we’ve done will be on the map in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lives will take place.
It’s one of the big, big — I’m not running, but I’m really running, so I’m fighting for great candidates wherever I can,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see what’s happening right now.
And they are firmly set to restore power, using any means, you can see subtlety, poverty.
They don’t care who suffers from them, who they have to go through to gain power and control, they want power and control, we’re not going to give them.”
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is “to resist and hinder.”
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “bad and ugly, ugly and liar.”
He recalled the Senate Judicial Committee, calling Senator Democrat Diane Finnstein by the name, which provoked the audience to loud voices of dissatisfaction.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
E-ee, what.
No, eh, no, I'm waiting -- it was really a bad language of the bodyguards -- the worst bodyguards language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinions.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted in favour of condemning me, it was hardly a surprise.
In the end, I am the last of those Members of Parliament who have been told that they are not happy, and all because we are expressing our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated almost the same way because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was convicted for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. These issues are ironically similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a press release on Friday’s Nottingham East Labour Meeting, it was stated: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee for my eight years as a local Member of Parliament from the Labour Party were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, many meetings today have a completely different tone, and the promise of a "more kind, softer" policy has long been forgotten if it has ever been implemented at all.
It is becoming increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not allow different views and each opinion is assessed from the standpoint of whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader. Colleagues with whom, as I thought before, I had similar political views, began to expect that I would turn 180 degrees and take a position with which I would never, at all.
Whenever I speak in public — and it doesn’t matter what I say — this is followed by the tyranny of social media attacks with calls for revocation, the condemnation of the politics of the center, I’m told that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I have been more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because my comments are usually political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the flows of sexist or racist attacks every day, but never refuse.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that the level of abuse has become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a broad church, and with every movement of “disbelief” or change in the rules of party selection, we narrow down.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice. I was urged not to stand up, not to speak so loudly that “everything was good with me.”
But I didn’t come to politics for that.
I joined the Labourers 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because due to the lack of attention from the government, Tetcher my high school class literally collapsed, since then I have sought to improve the quality of public services for those who need them the most.
I have never concealed my politics, including in recent elections.
No one in Nottingham East was bothered by my political views and disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who contributed to the Friday events, I only want to say one thing: in the circumstances when the country is stepping up to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to Lead.
Actually, I have another message, but not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters as members of the Labour Party, and not: I am proud of what I serve you, and I promise you that I am not threatening to revoke me or anyone else.

"Air" 38 - 17 "Melrous": the unstoppable "Air" rises up
The last two attempts may have slightly distorted the final result, but undoubtedly Air deserved a triumph in today’s great entertainment game for Scotland’s Premiership.
Now they are leading the table, this is the only invincible team out of ten.
Ultimately, great defense and improved ability to use the odds gives the owners and coach Peter Merchi the full right to be satisfied.
"So far we have been testing our games, and we are still unstoppable, so I have to be satisfied," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose commented: “I give up the proper Air, they’ve taken better chances than we have.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, implemented by Frasier Climate, pushed "Air" forward, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, issued "Verriors", allowed "Melrouz" to show the numbers, and Jason Baggott
Klimo strengthened the leadership of Air with the penalty and made and implemented a solo test just before the break, which gave a score of 17-5 in favor of Air.
But Melrose started the second time well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Baggot reduced the break to five points.
Then there was a prolonged delay due to the serious injury of Ruarid Knott, which was taken from the field on the carriers, and from the restart "Air" were pushed forward with the help of Stafford McDwell's attempt, which was implemented by Clima.
At the time, Captain Blair McFerson had a yellow card, and again, Melrose forced another player to pay for an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin under the stalled pressure.
The masters returned, but when Struan Hatchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Clima without a ball from the penalty area line, McFerson made a touchdown behind Air.
Clima realised the attempt he made almost every time after the restart, after which Kyle Row received a kick from David Armstrong in the box and sent the flanker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the host team.
It seems that the star of the series "Everything is still a game" set for a new career in the restaurant sector
It seems that the star of the series "Everything is still a game" Ford Kiran set for a new career in the field of hospitality. Such a conclusion can be made after it became known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, a script he writes for and in which he filmes with longtime comedy partner Gregor Hampshire.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last in the series, and Kirnan seems to be planning a life after Craigling.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source in Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan wanted to enter the "blooming restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"Our Sea": Inland Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
The Marines patrol the equipped fleet headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings hang an ocean-blue flag.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: “The sea is right.
We have to bring him back.”
In Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there is still a living memory of the loss of the coastline that left Chile in the bloody 19th century conflict over natural resources, and there is a desire to swim again in the Pacific.
These hopes are now probably the strongest in the last decade, as Bolivia is awaiting an international court ruling on October 1, after five years of trial.
“Bolivia has an impulse, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, it expects a positive result,” said Roberto Kalsadiya, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the announcement of the decision of the ICU on large screens across the country. They hope that the court in The Hague will make a decision in favor of Bolivia, that after a decade of talks, the severity of the conflict. Chile will be forced to talk to
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faced opposition to his re-election next year, also puts great hopes on the decision to be announced Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if this happens, little will change.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to award Chilean territory and noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ICU’s decision was taken only six months after the final arguments were put forward indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
The case of Bolivia has not progressed, the last four years could have contributed to the retreat back.
“The question of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
The warrior rhetoric of Morales exploded the remains of Chilean benevolence, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of divergence with mutual benefit,” he said.
He also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as a political militia.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
This decision is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if it can’t trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ree Yong Ho, said his country would never give up its nuclear weapons first before it could trust Washington.
Rie spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made at the summit in Singapore by the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments appeared when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of re-launching nuclear diplomacy, which went into a deaf corner more than three months after a Singapore summit with Kim Jong-un.
Ri says the belief that the continuation of sanctions and the U.S. declaration of an end to the Korean War will once put North Korea on its knees is an “unrealized dream.”
Washington is afraid to accept a declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps to disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the abandonment of its arsenal, which the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
At the Paris fashion shows presented the latest trend of massive main furnishings, which already directs to the main streets of your city
Whether you want to expand your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you have found what you need.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown demonstrated a series of eccentric oversized headwear from the spring-summer 2019 collection on the podiums of the shiny Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats overwhelming Instagram this summer, and named designers have already sent their stunning creations beyond the podium.
Valentino stood out with an extravagant beige hat with wide feathers decorated fields, which covered the heads of models.
Among other oversized accessories are decorated with gemstones of cabbage, witch hats and even pineapple hats, but they are not meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated the assortment of original masks – very early before Halloween.
Many of these multi-colored masks had covered lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One creature resembled equipment for underwater swimming with tubes and glasses, the other looked like an ice cube that melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you are lucky.
Stylists say that huge hats can go out on the main streets of your city.
Oversize hats came into fashion thanks to "Lea Bombi", a straw hat with fields of sixty centimeters of width, which was seen on everyone: from Rihanna to Emily Ratazhkovsky.
The cult brand, which stands behind a very impractical hat that could be seen everywhere on social media, gave the world another creation: a salmon beach bag of almost the size of a model in the bathtub that wore it.
A bag of yellowish-red rafting with a raccoon and a white leather handle was a central element of the La Riviera spring-summer 2019 collection of the brand Jacquemus at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of the cities, because the influence of the designer is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for an oversize store."
John Edward: Knowledge of Languages Compulsory for the Citizens of the World
Independent Schools of Scotland support high standards of education, and in 2018, great exam results were again obtained, complemented by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other fields.
These schools, where more than 30,000 students are educated throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCSC). They strive to provide the best level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, the careers they choose, as well as to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person in the language that he understands, he understands it by reason.
If you talk to her in her native language, she perceives it with her heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot use English only if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year’s exams, we see that in independent schools, languages lead in the rankings of subjects with the best ratings.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received a higher A score.
The data collected at 74 schools of SHRN showed that 72% of students received a higher A score from Chinese, and another 72% of those who learn German, 69% of those who learn French, and 63% of those who learn Spanish, also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as a subject of choice are now taught in the same way as the subjects of NTIM (science, engineering, engineering and mathematics), within the framework of independent school programs and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17% of employers are unable to close jobs due to lack of linguistic skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more necessary in preparing young people for a future career.
As more and more promising positions require knowledge of languages, these skills are necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if someone has learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, because it is a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who has multiple languages a preference over the competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people (15%).
That’s why investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will give children more chances of finding a full-time job.
In Scotland, each school will learn its own languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important to the UK from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, you will always be able to choose several languages to study them with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools are trying to create an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to achieve success regardless of what the future has prepared for them.
It cannot now be denied that in the international business environment, languages continue to have vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered “skills of international communication.”
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron debuts with Lakers in San Diego
Fans who want to see LeBron James's first start for the Los Angeles Lakers were almost ready.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the first pre-season game against the Denver Naggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is not yet decided.
“It’ll be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers official website.
"Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six games of the pre-season schedule "Lakers".
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump's Meetings in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of pre-election rally from Willing City, West Virginia today.
It is the first of five Trump rallyes scheduled for next week, including rallyes in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the nomination he proposed to the Supreme Court has been postponed, and Trump seeks to form support for future mid-term elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the vote.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight, and how do you view it on the Internet?
Trump’s meeting in Wiling City, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern time today, on Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online below on YouTube live stream.
Trump is likely to mention the tense hearings that took place this week about the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual harassment, and about postponing the vote by the Senate for a week as long as the investigation continues.
But the main purpose of this series of meetings is to help Republicans gain popularity before the November elections.
President Trump’s representatives said the five rallyes next week were aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
"Control over Congress is so critical to its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible as the tense campaign season is approaching," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
At the planned Wesbanko Arena stadium in Wiling City, today’s rally may be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media outlets from Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News reports.
The Saturday visit will be the second in the last month of Trump’s visit to West Virginia, a state in which he won more than 40% of the votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrissey, whose rating is backwards from polling results.
“It’s not good for Morrissey that the president is coming to raise his rating in polls,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Raider Cup 2018: U.S. team set to fight and full of hope on the eve of Sunday singles
After three sessions that ended with a one-sided victory, the Saturday afternoon forsomas could become exactly what was lacking in this Ryder Cup.
Emergency pulse flash is a completely invented sporting concept, in which players really believe, especially in similar competitions.
So when will they say that the pulse works?
“They were six points ahead, and now four, so I think we’re taking it a little bit as an impulse,” said Jordan Spitt as he left.
Europe has an advantage, of course, on four points ahead and another twelve in the game.
Americans, says Spit, feel a bit of wind in their winds, also a lot of what encourages them, not least the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each earned three points out of four.
The sleep with his deadly blows from the site to the grain shows an example.
These screams of celebration became louder as he made a decisive stride in his round and scored in the fourth match after he and Thomas were two points behind.
His patch, which allowed them to win a match on 15 pounds, met with a similar scream, one that tells you that the American team doesn’t seem to be.
"You really just have to work hard and worry about your own game," said Spit.
That’s all the players have left now.
Eighteen months to become known.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flywood, the indisputable history of the Raider Cup.
Unusual, but charming couple from Europe has four out of four and can’t make mistakes.
The "Molywoods" were the only couple who did not make the gods on Saturday afternoon, they also managed to avoid the gods on Saturday morning and after lunch on Friday and on the last nine Mondays on Friday morning.
This run and how their energy seems to flow to this turbulent crowd and backwards makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Flywood or Molinari to consolidate the potential victory of the National Golf over the Europeans.
Preferably both at the same time on different moons.
However, it is still too early to talk about the triumph of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson broke up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning foreballs, when he was in a pair with Alex Noren.
One god and two doves on the first nine moons brought the Spaniards and the Swedes to the moon from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the lounge.
Forballs and forssoms are very interesting to observe closely through the interaction between the participants of the pair, through the tips they give, the tips they do not give, and also interesting to observe how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe is playing better as a team so far and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this session of the force also showed that the U.S. team intends to fight, which some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe leads with a score of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup Europe will have a solid lead, because after Saturday's forebols and forebodings it is ahead of the United States with a score of 10-6.
The inspired duo Tommy Flywood and Francesco Molinari won two wins over the relegated Tiger Woods, and now at Le Golf National they have four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to return the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning forballs with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. made more resistance in the Forskolins and won two matches, but were unable to shorten the gap.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to keep the trophy.
Flywood is the first European innovator to score four points in a row, while he and Mollinary (along with "Mollywood") are only the second pair to score four points in the first four games in a row.
Having knocked Woods and Patrick Reed into forebolds, they united to defeat the inflated Woods and American novice Brian Deshambo with an even more impressive 5th4.
Woods, who pulled out two games on Saturday, showed a random flare of genius, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in forballs and forshocks and seven matches in a row.
Justin Rose, who didn’t take part in the morning forballs, returned to Henry Stanson’s forsook partner to get a 2-to-1 defeat from Justin Johnson and Brooks Coecka, who are first and third in the world rankings.
Europe was not able to do everything in its own way this pleasant fresh day to the south-west of Paris.
The three-time major winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday set the standard for the Americans by their two points.
They won a decisive 2–1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ion Polter in the forebols and later defeated Polter and Rory McLroy with a 4–3 forebols, losing the first two laps.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team returned with a four-point deficit in singles, although the Furic team, to keep the trophy, only needs nothing.
However, after the second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks like it's not up to them.
North Korea says “in no way” will be disarmed unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepened distrust of the United States, and that in such circumstances the country would not be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ree Young Ho said at the annual UN General Assembly that last year North Korea took "substantial goodwill measures" such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test site and decommissioning.
“However, we don’t see the appropriate reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
And while Ree has repeated North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s “stage” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement proved to be an important fact that it did not discourage it.
Ree referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first in history summit between the real U.S. president and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called on the Guardians to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula”, the Pyongyang Peninsula.
North Korea seeks to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should initially give up nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to weaken harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization at first’ and raises pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its goal violently, and even opposes the ‘declaration of an end to the war’,” he said.
To believe that sanctions can put us on our knees is an unfulfilled dream of those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ree didn’t mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to the three meetings of Kim and South Korean leader Moon Zhe In in the last five months, adding: "If a party to this issue of denuclearization would be South Korea, not the United States."
Despite this, the tone of Rie’s speech differed sharply from last year’s, when he told the General Assembly that North Korea’s targeting of missiles on the mainland of the United States was unavoidable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump himself called Kim Jong-un.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said that much more will be needed to be done and sanctions must remain in place.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set a timeframe for this: “It takes two years, three years, or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and unwaveringly until we see a full, final, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to block the financing of Pyongyang’s nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Rie in the corners of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for “gangster demands.”
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim needed "appropriate measures" as security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore, and steps to normalize relations with Washington, according to him.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year has provided all its students with more sleep. This is an attempt to fight the growing culture of cruising learning all night after filling with caffeine.
The teacher found that university students number one in the world are often uninformed when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chassler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigama Women's Hospital, developed a course that he thinks is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
In the end, one girl approached him and said, “Why are they telling me this now, at the last class?”
“She told me that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” a teacher told The Telegraph.
In the course, which was first introduced this year, students are explained the basics of how good sleep habits help achieve academic and sporting results, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's medical services, said the university decided to introduce a course after it was discovered that students were severely deprived of sleep for a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of the room in the dormitory, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, exercisers and books to learn about the influence of caffeine and light, the influence of sleep deficiency on sports indicators, as well as the importance of sleep-related routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
Next, the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the health consequences of smoking cigarettes,” Professor Chasler added.
The culture of pride for “waking up all night” still exists, he added, and also noted that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
Sufficient sleep of good quality should be a student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, even with a set of excess weight, since sleep deprivation transfers the brain to the mode of starvation, causing constant physical hunger.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chasler develop a course after enrolling in one of his other courses last year during his first year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be an appeal to all graduates with a request to pass a similar study program before arriving at a competitive institution.
Professor Chassler recommends students to put a reminder on what to sleep, as well as put a wake-up call and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light", which is emitted by electronic screens and LED lights and can disrupt the circuit board.
"Livingstone" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Mengy's goal upset Gerrard's boys
The Rangers survived another attack of exit sadness: Dolly Menge's strike brought a different team to Steven Gerrard's defeat with a 1-0 score from Livingstone.
The team of Ibrox sought to win their first victory in the exit game after the February triumph over St. John's with a score of 4-1, but the team of Harry Holt scored a second defeat of Jerrard's Seymour's Seychelles as the manager of 18 games.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lacked inspiration, did not look as if they could match the score.
Now the Rangers have gone down to sixth position, and the Livingstone have gone up to third, and by the difference of the balls they are only ahead of the Hibernian.
In addition, the Rangers may encounter another inconvenience, as the lynching man, Kalum Spence, was forced to deal with a head injury after he was thrown from the guest sector by some object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that once missed the Air in the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
And Holt released the same "Leave 11" team, which took one point in the "Harts" last week, and was fascinated by how his manufactured guys pushed opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have been dominant in possession of the ball, but the Livingstone have worked more with the ball.
They were supposed to score in just two minutes of the game when the first pass of Meng in the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit Allan McGregor's goal, but the half-defense missed this great chance by sending the ball through the goal.
A deep free kick by Keagan Jacobs got chipper Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litthou hit the rear bar
The Rangers were really in control, but there was more hope in the last third than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he should get a penalty on the mark a quarter of an hour after the collision with Steven Lowell, but the referee Steven Thompson refused to appeal to the Colombian.
The Rangers managed to make only two knocks on the first tie, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly hit Lassana Kulibali's head and the calm hit Oviedo Edjaria were hardly worried.
And although the goal of Liverpool for 34 minutes may have been in opposition to the game, no one can deny that they deserved it only with their hard work.
"Rangers" again failed to cope with Jacobs' preparations.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Meng for a simple finish.
During the break, Gerrard replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the winger broke into Morelos, but the stunning Kelly sniffed out of his line to block him.
However, Livingstone continued to force guests to play the game they liked when Litgo and Halkett made a long pass after each other.
Holt's team could have improved the result in the final stages, but McGregor had a good deal of resistance to Jacobs before hitting Litgow from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, the replacement for the Rangers, made another late application for a penalty when he met Jacobs, but Thompson looked back.
Almanah: the inventor of Geiger's counter
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and time goes by... in Germany the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that over time evolved into a device known as Geiger's counter.
Since then, countless Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example in the 1950s film "The Bells of the Coronado" with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play questionable.
The man said, “What is this?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter that is used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear how radioactivity in minerals affects atoms.”
Evans: “Well, it’s really cracking right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells and Kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method involves the removal of immune cells in the patient and their change in the laboratory
Then these cells are able to "see" the protein, which is common to many types of cancer. Then these cells are re-introduced to the patient.
The test vaccine demonstrates promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells in a patient, changing them in a laboratory so that these cells can “see” common to many types of protein cancer (HER2), and then re-introducing these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer,” he explained.
A similar approach, which consists in the removal of immune cells in patients and "learning" them to target cancer cells, worked in the treatment of one of the types of leukemia.
After appearing in the studio of the SNL show in the baseball team MAGA Canyon West, he clapped with a sharp speech in support of President Trump,
What Causes a Negative Reaction of the Viewers
Watchers at the SNL show (Subnight's Evening Live) smashed Canyon after his sumburious speech, during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town in a baseball game with the inscription “Give America Back to Former Glory,” he exploded with a tyranny in which he criticized Democrats, and once again declared his support for Trump.
“Often during a conversation, white people ask me, ‘How can you like Trump?
“Well, if racism had bothered me, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with Matt Damon's sketch, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony he had given before the Senate Legal Committee in the case of Christine Blaise Ford's lawsuit for sexual assault.
While West's speech was not broadcast live, the video with his tyranny was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock wanted to laugh at West by posting this post.
The West also complained to the viewers that behind the scenes with him was an unpleasant situation due to the headache.
As reported by the Washington Examiner, West said: “When I was behind bars, I was cruelly treated.
They said to me, “Don’t go out to the spectators in this baseball shirt.”
They were pissed at me!
And then they tell me that I’m in a place where the depressed are silent.”
West continued, "Do you want to see a place where the oppressed are silent? I'll wear my baseball superman because no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Then try to treat each other with love.”
According to Variety Weekly, his comments caused at least twice the negative reaction of the audience in the hall, and the actors of the show SNL looked lost. One of the viewers said: "The studio had a dead silence."
West was invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before the show.
West was shocked to many by performing the song I Love It (I Love It) in a Perrier water bottle costume.
Vesta was backed by TPUSA chairman Candes Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR STAYING FOR NATO."
Karen Hunter tweeted that West "is who he is, and it's just great."
Yet I will NOT reward him (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his “art”) who, in my opinion, confesses and throws out an ideology that hurts my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she added.
Before performing on the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: he is now "the one who was formerly known as the Canyon of the West."
West is not the first performer to change his name. He follows Grandpa's example, also known as Puff, Puffy and Puffy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg was formerly called Snoop Lyon, and as it is known, the musical legend of the last decades Prince changed his name to a symbol, then became an "Artist, formerly known as Prince".
Accused of attempted murder after a knife attack at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted deliberate murder after a knife wounding another man in one of the restaurants in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place at the Belligecamor restaurant.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast magistrates’ court on Monday.
The prosecutor's office is considering the charges.
Star of the series "Game of Thrones" Kit Gerington condemns the idealization of brutality
Cat Gerington became famous for the role of warrior with the sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones" produced by HBO.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke out against the stereotype of the macho hero, claiming that due to such heroes on screens, young boys often seem to have to be bold in order to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Cat said that, in his opinion, "something went wrong", and asked how to solve the problem of idealizing brutality in the era of popularity of the hashtag <0x23>MeTo (<0x23>everything, <0x23>hate, etc.).
The cat, who recently married his "Game of Thrones" colleague, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, said he was "satisfiedly determined" to fight this problem.
"I am currently set up quite decisively. When did we get on the slippery path of idealization of brutality?" - he asked.
“Why do we teach future men if we look at their growth through the prism of the problem we see now?”
The cat believes that television is partly responsible for popularizing brutality due to the imagery of extremely brave heroes.
He continued, “What is natural, and what are we planted?
Why does television and the street teach that young men feel the pressure to be the same men?
In my opinion, today the really important question is, “How do we change that?”
After all, it’s obvious that the young guys have fallen off the right path.”
In the interview, he also noted that he will not be filmed in any prequels and sequels "Game of Thrones" after the show's show of the following summer, as "has already ended with battles and horses".
From November, Cat will play in the play "The True West" by Sam Shepard - the story of the film producer and his robber brother.
As the actor recently admitted, he considers meeting with his wife Rose the best he has gotten from participating in the series Game of Thrones.
“While filming in this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and defined my next life,” said Kate.
In the fantasy series that won the Emmy Awards, Rose played Igritt – the love of Herington’s hero John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018. The ceremony was held on the territory of the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a sharp increase of 14% in new cases of the disease
In China, there has been a sharp increase of 14% in the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to representatives of health authorities, there are more than 820,000 patients in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases of the disease were reported.
In most cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, which indicates a change in the past trend.
For a long time, in some regions of China, HIV spread rapidly through infected blood during transfusions.
However, according to official health officials at the conference held in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Timely sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Decriminalization of homosexuality in China occurred in 1997, but the LGBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to the study, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men are later married to women because of the dominance of conservative values in the country.
The transmission of the disease in most cases occurs as a result of the improper use of the means of protection during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to provide free access to HIV medicines, seeing this way to partially solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the fusion of Republican senators' data into the network by her permanent worker and sharply criticizes "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
On Saturday, U.S. House Representative Maxine Waters condemned vocal statements that one of her staff members posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
A Los Angeles Democrat claims that these statements spread to “ultraright” political viewers and websites.
“Lie, lie, and then even more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The information, reportedly, contained home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Greeme of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Hetch of Utah.
The data appeared on the network on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown person from Cape Town during hearings in the Senate commission on charges of sexual offences brought against court by Brett Kavanaugh, a U.S. candidate for the seat of the Supreme Court.
The data leak came some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, there was information that the IP address of the leak source was linked to the Waters office and behind it was able to find the data of its staff collaborator.
“These unsubstantiated claims are absolutely false, they do not correspond to reality,” Waters continued.
“The staff of my office, whose personal data and security has been compromised as a result of these fabricated and false statements, has nothing to do with the leakage of this information.
These unsubstantiated statements are absolutely false, they do not correspond to reality.”
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized on the network, including former White House press secretary Ari Flischer.
“This denial is filled with anger,” Flacier wrote.
"It suggests that with such a character she cannot be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, you don’t have to be angry.
The defendant should not behave condescendingly.
He should not ask about the motives of the accused.
He has to remain calm and uninterrupted.”
Fliesher seems to have made parallels between Waters’ reaction and a criticism of Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry during Thursday’s hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is voting to replace Waters on the results of the interim elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“This is the news if everything is really true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters noted that her office had already notified "the relevant state and law enforcement authorities of these false statements".
“We will do our best to find the culprits,” she continued, “and they are responsible before the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all my workers.”
Review of the film "Agent Johnny English: The New Mission" – a temporary parody of spy fighters with Rowen Atkinson
It has already become a good tradition to look for in every new British film of meaning, novels of Brexit. They are also in the new part of the series of comedy parodies on the militants about Johnny England. The first film was called "Johnny English", the song of the year 2003, released on the screen.
Will ridiculously-ironically self-satisfied with what we are short-lived become the new export potential of the nation?
Either way, Johnny Inglesh with his moving face and gloomy eyes was given the opportunity to make a mess a second time, while his name more than anything else suggests that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English countries.
As you know, Johnny is a incredibly fun 2012 secret agent, in which, despite his strange attempts to be galant and charming, there is a little bit from Inspector Cluzo, a little bit from Mr. Bina and a lot of things - a song from the guy who played one note of the melody of the song.
The character’s image is also a traveler and a mystery of an international scale, which has always left behind the mess that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard’s long-forgotten television ad.
In the last film about Johnny England there are a few good moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Inglesh in his cavalry gear was approaching the helicopter, and the blades of the bolt were beating around his helmet.
The film reveals Atkinson's talent to arrange a buffalo, but humor is transient, and at times it is too much, especially when compared to "serious" movie brands, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission impossible".
It seems to me that jokes are intended for children rather than adults, and I don't think the ridiculous assaults that are happening with Johnny Inglesh are as inventive and thoughtful as Atkinson's footage in the movies about Bing.
As always, the film begins with the fact that there was a serious threat to the UK.
In the British supersecret network of spies, a hacker infiltrates and reveals the names of all the field agents, which became a complete surprise for the acting agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an episodic role in the film).
This turned out to be the last drop for the prime minister – a proud person who has already suffered devastating criticism and is in a deep depression due to the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried not to convey her to the best of hers an image, the story of Theresa May).
Intelligence advisers informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she needed to attract someone from the resignation.
The choice falls on Johnny England, who is now working as a teacher at a superfashioned institution and informally teaches children to operate undercover (in this part with the spy "school of the year").
The English are quickly taken to Whitehall for an emergency briefing, where he meets again with his much-loved friend Buff, whom Ben Miller once again plays.
Buff is now married to the captain of the submarine (the role of an exasperated bored person does not fully match Vicky Pepperdin's talent).
So, when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty went smoothly, "Batman and Robin" return in a row and unexpectedly meet the fatal woman Ofelia Pistoletov, played by Olga Kurilenko.
And at this time, the prime minister falls under the spell of a charismatic billionaire, who has earned his stature in the field of technology and technology, and claims that it can solve the problem with the British network, – the villainous Jason Volta, played by Lee Jay.
English and Buff go on a journey and again resort to their ridiculous whistleblowers: disguised by waiters they make a fire in a chic French restaurant; then they sow chaos, a whistleblower illegally travelling abroad on a luxurious yacht.
All stops lead us to the last episode, but with his kindness and madness, it kind of reminds us of a movie for children.
A passive film.
Like when watching other movies about Johnny English, I asked myself the same question: Can the British film industry not offer Rowena Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
Labourers deny the preparation of a plan according to which British workers will work four days a week, but will receive a salary in five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is set to discuss a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but would get a five-day paycheck.
It is reported that the party wants to oblige the leaders of the companies to transfer the funds saved as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers, providing them with an extra weekend.
Thus, workers will have a three-day weekend and at the same time will bring home the same salary.
According to sources, this idea will be in line with the party’s economic program and targets the country’s resources to support the working class.
The transition to the four-day working week was approved at the British Trade Unions Congress. It is expected that in this way workers will be able to benefit from the change in the overall economic situation.
A source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A review of policy will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the party’s approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party.
Labourers weren’t the first to endorse the idea, as the Green Party had promised to introduce a four-day working week even during the 2017 election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party at the moment approve of such aspirations.
The Labour Party spokesman said: “The political agenda of the party does not provide for the introduction of a four-day working week, so we are not considering this idea right now.”
"The Shadow" Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at last week's Labour Party election rally.
Mr. McDonnell said he was set to take power back from the "small directors" of utility enterprises and the "inquirers".
The Chancellor's shadow plan also means that shareholders of water supply companies may not get their full share of capital if the Labour government introduces "deductions" on the basis of imaginary violations.
He also confirmed his intentions to include employees in the board of directors of companies and to set up inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of the ordinary shares of private sector firms to employees who expect annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on the show 60 Minutes (60 minutes), whether the investigation of the FBI-led Kavanaugh case can change their minds
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who leads the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as judge of the Supreme Court is postponed for at least a week. There is a question of whether the senators will continue to indict Republicans and subordinates.
On Sunday's 60 Minutes show, Scott Pelley, a correspondent, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yeah, of course," said Kennedy.
During the hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after everything had happened and the charges came and I asked him, “Did you really do that?”
He was decisive, uncompromising, uncompromising.”
It seems that Graham’s opinion will no longer change anything.
“I believe that removing Kavanaugh’s accusations is a provocation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has strongly denied everything," Graham added, addressing Christine Blaise Ford.
And everyone she calls can't confirm it under oath.
This happened 36 years ago.
I don’t know what can change.”
What is a Global Citizen Festival and how can it affect poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival – an annual event in the music world with an astounding number of star performers and not least the astonishing mission – to overcome poverty around the world.
During the seventh Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will participate in the Great Hall of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to draw attention to the true purpose of the festival.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international public organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively struggling with it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you don't want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors must perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as taking to learn in a volunteer project, to write an e-mail to the world leader, to make a phone call.
So, are there any results already, because there are 12 years left for Global Citizen organizers to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding for doing a free concert really a great way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicitism" when people feel that something is really changing by signing an electronic petition or making a public announcement?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million “acts” of their supporters aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to declare planned financial allocations and programs in the amount of more than <0x24>37 billion, which will help change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited as an example of the results of its activities 390 financial liabilities and public statements, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
According to the group, the funds already directly affected the lives of approximately 649 million people around the world.
Among the main financial liabilities of 700 is the fund The Power of Nutrition, which belongs territorially to the United Kingdom. As part of the project, investors and marketers took on the commitment of "helping children to grow up" and promised to provide the Global 35.
“With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, the owners, the governments of other countries and the citizens of the world like you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a minor fact of history,” said The Power of Nutrition spokeswoman Tracy Ullman.
The organization also said that after 5,000 "actions" called for improving the nutrition of mothers and children, the UK government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, "Why do you think you will be able to overcome extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen representatives wrote: “This is a long and difficult journey, so sometimes we fall down and we’ll be faced with failures.
“However, like the members of the civil rights and anti-apartheid movement, we will succeed because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are just some of the star performers who will perform at the festival in New York this year, with Deborah Lee Fernes and Guy Jackman.
The interior minister said that the United States could use naval forces to "block" to prevent the export of Russian energy resources.
According to U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted in the Washington Examiner, “if necessary,” Washington can use the help of the naval forces to prevent the entry of Russian energy resources into the markets, including Seychelles.
Zinke said Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a reason to explore new energy markets.
“I think they are in the Middle East because they want to become an intermediary in energy trade, as they are already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means of solving the problem.
"Thanks to the naval forces, the United States can provide free passage by sea and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy resources do not enter the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, which was held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that positions itself as the "voice of every consumer" in the United States.
He then compared the approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually similar.
“The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we are efficiently using energy resources and replacing them with alternatives,” he said, calling Russia a “unilaterally developed economy” because its economy depends on energy.
While these statements were released, the Trump administration set the goal of spurring the export of compressed natural gas to Europe, eliminating the Russian-origin energy market, a significantly cheaper option for Europeans.
To do this, Trump administration officials and President Donald Trump themselves are trying to persuade the German government to abandon the “unreasonable” project of building the North Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin hostage.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the gasoline "North Stream 2", which is worth <0x24>11 billion and which will double the capacity of the existing gasoline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"In my view, we share the view that energy resources cannot be a pressure tool and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. Minister of Energy Rick Perry.
The U.S. position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization The Federal Association of German Industry (BDI) has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I don’t like it when a third country interferes with our energy supplies,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with President Putin.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren "seriously thinks" about voting for president in 2020
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she was “seriously thinking” about voting for president after the midterm elections.
During a public meeting in the city of Hollow, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of applying.
As The Hill Warren said, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and set up a government, and for this, there must be a woman in charge.”
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider my candidacy for president.”
During a public meeting, Warren expressed her appreciation of Donald Trump’s presidency, saying that he “will lead his country in the wrong direction.
“I’m extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was frank, criticizing Trump and his proposed candidacy for Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: “... undoubtedly, the FBI should conduct an investigation before voting.”
However, according to the results of the poll published on Friday, most voters don’t think Warren should vote in 2020.
According to the results of a poll jointly conducted by the University of Suffolk’s Center for Political Studies and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of potential voters in the state of Massachusetts voted against the removal of their candidate as a senator.
Thirty-two percent supported the expulsion.
The results of the survey showed that the former governor Deval Patrick is more supported. For the potential appointment of him to the post of President, 38%, against – 48%.
While discussing the nominations of other well-known Democrats, who may run in 2020, are also named former vice president Joe Biden and state senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Palin recalls Trek Palin's PTSD during a rally in support of Donald Trump
26-year-old Trek Pailin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence, and the incident took place on Monday night.
"What my son is going through now, what he is going through after his return, can only be understood by other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and other health problems with which our soldiers return to their homes," she said in a statement.
Pailine called Trek's arrest "a problem that no one pays attention to" and said that her son and other war veterans "return home not the way they were before, more cruel, and want to know if they respect what they've done for them."
According to a spokesman for the Vasilla City Police Department, Den Bennett, Trek was arrested on Monday in the town of Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault of rape of a woman, as well as the fact that he abused her.
18 states and counties of Colombia support appeals for asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of a new U.S. policy, according to which victims of gang persecution and domestic violence refuse to grant refugee status.
According to NBC News, representatives from 18 states and counties sent an analytical note of a court consultant to Washington to support a plaintiff who needed asylum and appealed the aforementioned policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case against the U.S. Citizens' Union's civil rights lawsuit, which appeals federal policy and which was filed in August, is not disclosed.
The appellant said that her partner "and his cruel sons-bandits" beat her, but U.S. officials rejected her when she asked for asylum on July 20.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
State prosecutors, who support Grace’s lawsuit, said residents of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (who often seek asylum in the United States) often face serious problems such as banditry and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy repeals the decision of the Board of Appeal on Immigration in 2014, according to which immigrants without documents who have escaped domestic violence could request asylum.
The District Attorney General of Columbia, General Carl Reyesin, said during his speech on Friday that the new policy “ignores a decade of state laws, federal and international laws.”
“The federal law requires that the decision on the application for refugee status be based on consideration of the facts and circumstances set out in such a statement, and the prohibition violates this principle,” the court’s analytic note reads.
The prosecutors further argue that a policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the United States is damaging to the country’s economy as they can potentially become entrepreneurs and “fill in the necessary labour resources.”
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions issued an order in June for immigration judges that said they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
“The award is given to persons who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution due to racial affiliation, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views,” Sessions said during the presentation of Rule 11.
Giving asylum was never intended to solve all the discrepancies, even those serious problems that people all over the world face on a daily basis.
Rescuers desperately try to find the survivors, while the number of deaths in Palu has doubled.
For those who have survived, the situation continues to deteriorate.
“The situation is very tense,” says a 35-year-old mother, reassuring her boy with fever in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, ambulances bring the body.
“Clean water is not enough.”
Some residents return to their ruined homes, relocating flooded remains, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged as a result of the earthquake, whose strength was 7.5 points on the Richter scale, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Guerris with a fracture of the back and shoulder, rest near the building of the army hospital of Palu, where patients are provided with help in the open air due to repeated shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he remembered how a strong push shook a hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for rescue.
It seems to me that I was stuck in the middle of the wall smashed,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife pleading for help, and then the silence prevailed.
I don’t know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "exercising psychological pressure" by using "advertising that contains propaganda"
A week after the Chinese state newspaper posted on four pages of the U.S. daily newspaper advertising material about the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. for the purpose of exploiting the U.S.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a pay-up application of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa after accusing China of trying to influence the elections to Congress, which will take place on November 6.
According to Reuters officials in the United States, Trump’s statements, in which he accuses Beijing of attempting to interfere in U.S. elections, mean a new phase of Washington’s escalation, whose goal is to put pressure on China.
While foreign governments may place ads to boost trade, there is an escalation in the trade war between Beijing and Washington, in which they have already increased import tariffs.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the introduction of a repressive tariff in China was intended to strike on exporters from states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Brensted, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brensted wrote in the Sunday column of the Des Moines Register, “increases pressure by publishing propaganda-containing advertisements in our independent press.”
“To spread the propaganda, the Chinese government is using the way for the American people the tradition of freedom of speech and independence of the press by placing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register,” Brenstead wrote.
"Contrary to this, on the street layouts here in Beijing, you will find only separate voices of dissidents. Here you will not see a true reflection of what the Chinese people actually think about the direction of the development of the chinese economy, which is called by the chinese economy.
He also added that "one of the most important Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but did not name which one.
Analysts warn that by failing with Kavanaugh Republicans set up women voters against themselves before the midterm elections
Since many well-known Republicans support and defend the candidate for the post of Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh after he has been charged with sexual harassment, analysts warn that this may cause a misdemeanor.
There is a lot of passion around this situation, and most Republicans publicly say they would like to go to the polls.
Such things cannot then simply be played back,” said Grant Riger, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, in an interview with The Hill, published on Saturday.
Rieger expressed doubts that the FBI investigation, which in the last minute began insisting on Senator Jeff Flake (a Republican from Arizona), would be enough to soothe angry voters.
As reported by the Washington, D.C., head advisor and spokeswoman for the Progressive Group MoveOn, Catherine Jean-Perrier said on Friday: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget tomorrow.”
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protesters sang "November is approaching!" during a demonstration in the Legal Committee, when Republicans decided to move to Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Krizi.
In an interview with the news website, Stew Rottenberg, a non-partisan political reviewer, said: “People will be extremely interested and motivated.”
“They say it is now, and it’s true.
However, motivation can increase, especially among voters aged 18-29 who are not yet determined and often do not vote if they do not like the president.
Even before Ford gave testimony in connection with the allegations of a candidate for the position of a Supreme Court judge in a sexual crime, analysts predicted the voters’ negative reaction if Republicans insist on endorsement.
As NBC News reported earlier this week, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steele, said: “This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party.”
As noted in an interview with the news channel, Director of Priorities USA (US Priorities) (a group that helps in the election campaign for Democrats) Guy Cecil, "it's not about the vote of the committee, what they've done, what they've done in the final vote, or that Kavanaugh has come to a standstill."
However, the opinions of Americans about whose testimony to believe, Ford or Kavanaugh, have been divided.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believe or rather believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35% of respondents believe or rather believe in Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% of the respondents said that, in their opinion, Kavanaugh gave or rather gave false testimony, while 30% of the respondents said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after Flake's insistence, the FBI is conducting a verification of the allegations made by Ford and another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified on oath to the Senate Legal Committee about how Kavanaugh attacked her while in a state of alcoholic intoxication at the age of 17.
Ramirez said that the candidate for the post of Supreme Court judge showed her her genitalia at a party during their studies at Yelsky University in the 1980s.
Inventor of World Wide Web Plans to Launch ‘New Internet’ to Create Competition between Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the global Internet network, is launching a new startup to create competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of the world of technology, Inrupt, is engaged in the development of an open source platform Solid, the idea of which belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store the data and who to provide access to that or that information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt was "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows users to create a "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can store contact lists, current business lists, calendar, audio library, and other tools for your own use and work.
It’s like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify simultaneously in one browser.
A unique feature of this personal online data storage is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “expansion of personal capabilities through data”.
According to Inrupt CEO John Bruce, the company aims to engage resources, processes and relevant skills to make the Solid platform accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased from IBM, several staff developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not negotiating with Facebook and Google on whether to make a full replacement when all of their business models undergo radical changes in a short period of time.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a Saturday publication on Medium Berners-Lee, he wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to “provide commercial energy transport and ecosystem and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the basis of the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debates on net neutrality.
Even at the time of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, The Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic about the next era of network development,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Dedication of the Order of the Church of the Cross of Victoria in the Years of the First World War
The only representative of the Anglican Church who received the Order of the Cross of Victoria for participating in the fighting during World War I is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his participation in the attack on the Belenglish and Leokur on September 29, 1918.
However, he died of a sniper bullet four days later and never learned that he had received Britain’s highest military award.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rashden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, called it "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place just 100 years after his grandfather performed the feat for which he was rewarded.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann transferred his battalion through the Saint-Catherine Canal "through a very dense fog and under the dense fire of field guns and bullets."
Later he hurried to the firefront and with "desperate bravery" led the line forward, before this one broke into the field gun and destroyed three enemy guns.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – a little more than a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann said that his grandfather did what he would never have been able to repeat and that he deserves respect.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann were crowned after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very proud of participating in this parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero is shown by the respect that so many people show to him."
MMA fans did not sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 tournament, but instead showed them "Pig Peppa"
Imagine that you don’t sleep all night, just to watch the events of the Bellator 206 tournament, and you are denied the opportunity to watch the main event.
The posters of the tournament, which took place in San Jose, featured 13 battles, including six sets of the main program, which were broadcast live at night in the UK on 5 channels.
At 6:00 a.m., just before Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to get together in a match, television viewers in the UK were surprised when a Peppa pig appeared on the screen instead of a fight broadcast.
Some spectators weren’t excited about it, as they didn’t sleep until the morning, waiting for the battle.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that switching to a children’s cartoon seemed to him “somewhat an unsuccessful joke”.
“According to the government’s resolution, the content that was broadcast at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to release a child broadcast,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications with Bella kalitor.
“Pig Peppa,” he said.
Bellator President Scott Cocker has pledged to work on the broadcast schedule to cover viewers in the UK in the future.
"I think if we talk about the repeat of the broadcast, then we can arrange it," Cooker said.
“But now there’s Sunday, 6 a.m., and we can’t do anything until we have Sunday, and they’re Monday.
However, we are working on this.
Trust me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received a lot of messages that we responded to, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical failure, and we tried to remove it.
However, it turned out that this was a non-compliance with government mandates.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We cut the tournament to five fights instead of six, as usual. We tried to redirect the signal for the fans, but so far these attempts have been postponed.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dale felt "worse" over others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic water jumper Tom Dale says he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t understand that “not everyone looks like him” until he went to high school.
Participating in the broadcast of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he noted that he openly spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that due to parenting, he became less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The leader, who has been running this program for a long time, Kirste Young, went to the hospital for several months.
Coming as a couple to Laverne's first program, Dale said he felt "worse" than others in childhood because "the society didn't realize when someone liked boys and girls."
He said: “Until this time, the feeling of inferiority and difference was precisely what gave me the strength and strength to succeed.”
According to him, he sought to prove that something was "apartment" so as not to disappoint all those who eventually learned about his orientation.
The double-bronze Olympic winner has become a well-known LGBT rights fighter and has taken advantage of the appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was frank about his views, because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion admitted that feelings for the man, American film director Justin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, became a real surprise for him.
Dale married an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him last year, but, he said, the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through all this at such a young age" (at the first Olympics he performed at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would also survive similar crashes.
In June, the couple had a son named Robert Ream Black Dale, and since then, according to Dale, his "light perception" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, I would only think about what I should have gotten gold,” he said.
“You know, there are things that are much more important than the Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dale said his father could not reconcile with the thought of the end and asked before his death whether he had bought tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be in the first row, because you won’t be around anymore,’” Dale said.
“I held him in my hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: to run in front of my countrymen at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better than that,” Dale said.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song – Proud (Horror) by Giser Smoll – which resonated with him while preparing for the Olympics and still invokes ants.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
On Saturday from the tournament for the "Ryder Cup" Michaelson, who was not in shape
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday after playing his 47th game in the Ryder Cup tournament, but he has to reshape the form so that the event does not become unhappy for him.
Michaelson, who is in the record 12th time participating in the tournament, which takes place every two years, took Captain Jim Furick out of the game during forballs and forsams.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did playing for the United States, the five-time winner encouraged the team all day and trained aside in hopes of mastering emotions.
Since Michaelson was not famous for his shots, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete did not quite fit for a challenging Le Golf National golf course, where the raft usually punishes for slippery kicks.
And if the field is no longer the obstacle, in the ninth game on Sunday Michaelson will have to meet the champion of the Open Championship and the master of the exact strike Francesco Molinari, who in pairs with the newcomer Tommy Flywood won his team.
If the Americans, who are three points behind after 12 singles matches, start well, the Michaelson match can be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his athlete, and, probably, besides that, he had nothing to add.
“He finally understood his role today, clapped me in the back, hugged me and said that he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He has no doubts about his strength.
Michaelson is a member of the Hall of Fame who has done so much for the teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play in two games.
I predicted more matches, but that’s how it came out, so we decided to do it.
He wants to be there, on the field, like anyone else.”
If Michaelson comes to the field on Saturday, he will beat the record of Nick Faldo, who played the most matches in the Raider Cup tournament.
On this he may end his career in the Ryder Cup tournament, which never matched his individual achievements.
For Michaelson's 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 no results, however, Furik said his presence could play a decisive role for the team.
“He’s funny, he’s greedy, he likes to joke with others, he’s a guy who’s nice to have in the team,” Furik said.
"I think the younger players had a good time eating at him, and this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He’s more than just a player.”
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the big breakout doesn’t solve anything.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a noticeable break before the singles matches of the last day of the Ryder Cup tournament does not yet guarantee a win.
The Danish debuted in a 1997 game at Walderram, where the team led by Sev Ballesteros surpassed the Americans by five points, but won the game with a slight draw of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big break in the game on the Walderrams; a big break in Brooklyn where we lost, and on the Walderrams where we won the violence," Bjorn said after watching the championships of the Class' 2018, as a result of 5:3.
So the story teaches me and every player of the team that nothing has been resolved yet.
Tomorrow we have to play with the best possible returns.
Go out on the field and do everything you need.
The game will only be completed after the result appears on the board.
We have a goal – to win this trophy, and that’s what we’re looking for.
"As I said before, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our team, but we're well aware of who's going to be against us - the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players on the difficult field, Bjorn added: "I will never run forward.
Tomorrow, everything can be different.
Tomorrow we will have a game, and that’s something else.
It’s nice to play on the field with a partner when everything goes well, but it’s just when you’re standing there alone, and you can check out what you’re worth as a golfer.
This is how you need to set the players to perform tomorrow: on the limits of possibilities.
You’re leaving your partner without support and now he has to show what he’s capable of.”
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furick expects his partners to play best on an individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Fourik's fate on the last day came back from different sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but was defeated when the team from Europe created "The Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Cranshaw, captain of the team in 1999, organized the players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we have to start successfully, as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone else’s side, players in the middle of the distance experience special pressure.
“We have properly placed the players in the team, so it’s like we’re going to do something incredible tomorrow.”
Thomas was commissioned to try to lead a counter-attack in the top game against Rory McKeeley. Next to the first half of the European team list were Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flywood and Ian Paulter.
"It is these partners and in this way I chose because I want to distribute the effort evenly throughout the game," Bjorn commented on his choice of players for individual matches.
The entry into force of a new German battleship has been postponed again
The most modern frigate of the German naval fleet was to be put into operation in 2014 instead of the outdated battleships during the Cold War. However, according to local media, this will not happen to war until at least next year. due to malfunctioning systems and bug
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, the introduction of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the main ship of the most modern battalion of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was expected to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the shipment damaged the implementation of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some technologies to reduce visibility, in particular, radar, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer period of technical maintenance. It is expected that the new frigates will not be able to return to the port of base in about two years.
However, journalists warn that due to the constant delays, modern warships, which were supposed to boost Germany’s military power at sea, are also becoming obsolete at the time of commissioning.
The F125 was headlined a year ago when the German naval forces officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm <0x2B> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a military ship has been returned to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
The reasons for the return were little known, but the German media mentioned significant "software and equipment defects" that made the battleship unsuitable for military operations.
The disadvantages of the software are of particular importance as the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class ship consists of approximately 120 sailors - that is only half the number of soldiers who served on the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the vessel has a significant excess weight, which deteriorates its operating performance and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
The Rhineland-Palatinate frigate is thought to be twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of training the crew.
The expected <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion turned into a colossal <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion).
Problems with obtaining new frigates gained special weight in light of recent warnings about the decline of the German naval forces.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, who was commissioned by the Bundestag for the Armed Forces, reported that the country's navy "was left with a small number of ships capable of carrying out combat tasks."
The official said that the situation had deteriorated rapidly over a period of time, as the old ships had come out of service and the new ones had not arrived.
He expressed deep regret that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to fill the navy.
The National Trust will observe the secret life of the prisoners
A new study, which is being conducted on the territory of land ownership in the Scottish Mountains, aims to establish how rodents use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data obtained will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to take measures to preserve them in the future.
In the gardens of Invera in West Rossi, scientists of the National Trust of Scotland will observe such species as the netapyr dwarf and netapyr pygmy, as well as the ears of the ordinary and aquatic nightmare.
Special registrars will be placed in strategic locations in the territory of land ownership to monitor the behavior of the rodents during the season.
Workers and volunteers from the National Trust of Scotland will also conduct mobile research using handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help establish the frequency and affiliation of the screams of the thunderstorms.
It is then planned to develop a detailed animal habitat map and prepare a report to link the behavior of animals with their habitat.
Rob Dewyer, Scotland’s National Trust’s nature conservation adviser, hopes that the results of the study will help determine which areas of habitat are most important for rodents and how they are used for each of the species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of environmental care measures (e.g., the formation of swamps) and identify the optimal methods of forest conservation for rodents and other related species.
During the last century, the population of indigenous peoples has declined significantly in Scotland and the territory of the United Kingdom.
They are threatened by the active construction and occupation of territories, which deprives them of their nest sites.
Other negative factors include wind installations and lighting, adhesive paper for flies, chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
They are actually not blind.
However, due to hunting at night, the ears are more effective in helping them catch the prey than the eyes.
They use a complex echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on the flight trajectory.
Scotland’s National Trust, which cared for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special significance and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about the problem of indigenous people.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, inspections of nest sites and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts even created the first and only shark reserve in Scotland. It is located on the territory of the Trive site in the area of Damfries-and-Hallowey. It found shelter eight of the ten species of sharks that survive.
David Thompson, who manages the positions, says it’s the perfect place for them.
"On the territory of Triv, there are excellent conditions for the prisoners," he assures.
"There are old buildings, many huge trees and other favorable living conditions.
However, we still need to learn a lot about peasants. Thanks to the research we are doing here and elsewhere, we will be able to learn more about what they need to thrive."
He insists that it is very important to check the territory for the presence of prisoners before carrying out any technical work, since due to the inadvertent destruction of one place of nest for the removal of all the pupils, the instruction of up to 400 females with children can die, the reason is that the
Cats and their nests are protected by law. Animals are forbidden to kill, torture or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Centre for the Conservation of Poultry, called on the public to join the organization's efforts.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our mammals. We have not yet revealed the characteristics of populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and his lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the German edition
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations a "delusion" and said people were "trying to attract attention" using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published information on the suspicions.
American Catherine Mayorga has accused the forward of Portugal and the football club Juventus of raping her in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the magazine Der Spiegel on Friday, Ronaldo allegedly paid her <0x24>375,000 for silence.
A few hours after the charges were filed, 33-year-old Ronaldo appealed to 142 million of his fans in a video broadcast on Instagram, calling the corresponding messages "a mockery".
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are a mockery," - said the five-time owner of "Golden Ball" on the camera.
“They want to draw attention to themselves, using my name.
That's natural.
These people want to hang on to me, but such situations are part of my job.
I’m a happy person and I’m fine,” the footballer added, smiling.
According to Reuters news agency, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing lawsuits against Der Spiegel for published allegations, which they called "an unacceptable report of suspicion in the privacy sphere".
Attorney Christian Sherc said the footballer would demand compensation for "moral damages to the extent that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most pronounced cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
It is claimed that the incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Casino hotel room in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after the meeting at the Ronaldo and Majorga nightclub, they returned to the player's room where he allegedly raped her. Such evidence was transferred to the County Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident described, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and said he was a "99 percent good guy" who was "one percent".
As noted in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but with collective consent.
Majorga also claims that she turned to the police, and then to the hospital, where her injuries were photographed. However, she later agreed to extramarital settlement, because she was "fearful of revenge" and guarded against "public humiliation".
Now, the 34-year-old woman seeks to cancel the previous deal as she continues to suffer from an incident that, she said, took place.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was preparing to move to FC Real Madrid from Manchester United. This summer he became the player of the granddaughter of Italian football, the team "Juventus", for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will "forever regret" the loss of car manufacturers
The UK will "forever regret" if it loses its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit. This is warned by the Minister of Economy Greg Clark.
He added that he was endorsed by representatives of Toyota UK, who told BBC reporters that in the event of Britain leaving the EU without a deal, the company would be forced to stop production and operation of its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Minister Clarke.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of a delay at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The plant in Bernaston, which produces Toyota models Auris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 cars this year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my view, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be halted,” said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover are also concerned about how the UK’s exit from the EU will be without a deal on international trade.
For example, BMW said that the production plant of the Mini in Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the fact that a no-deal Brexit could pose risks to supply chains.
Toyota’s production line operates in an operative mode of delivery of parts and materials according to the needs – parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be interruptions in the supply of parts at the border, leading to delays and lack of materials.
As noted by the company, parts can be placed in the stock of Toyota for no more than one day. So production will have to stop.
Greg Clark noted that in terms of organizing relations with the EU prepared by Theresa May (Chequers Plan), "there are separate schemes to avoid problems at the border".
"We need a deal. We need to make an optimal deal, which, in my opinion, will enable us not only to achieve success at the moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during the program Today on BBC 4.
“In view of the testimony of Toyota and other car manufacturers, we need to maintain the formation of high-efficiency supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to report how long the production will be stopped, but in the long run they expect that the increase in costs will lead to a decrease in the factory's competitiveness and, as a result, will force workers to cut down.
Peter Tzuvalaris, chairman of the organization committee of the Unite professional union at the plant in Bernaston, which has worked here for 24 years, said that the other participants are extremely concerned: "I can say from experience that the reduced jobs are not declining."
A government spokesman said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for shaping our future relations with the EU.”
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting may be postponed again, White House said
As White House officials reported on Sunday, the responsible meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as discussions on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Venetian post continue.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and potential obstructions to justice by the president.
For several months, Washington has been discussing the possibility of the release of the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had commented on the use of microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of early termination of the president's powers after the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House against the background of reports that the official is going to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "doesn't want" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash in time with the Senate Legal Committee meeting, at which the witness Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of suing him were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, has appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein she replied: "The date of the meeting is not set. It may be this week. I expect it to be postponed for another week, given all events related to the Supreme Court.
But let's see. I'm constantly watching for the press to have the latest information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders hasn’t held press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Leading Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the infrequent briefings were not related to the hostility to "play in the public" by television reporters, although she added, "I will not deny that they are playing in the public."
She then assumed that Trump himself would communicate more with the press.
“The president answers the question more often than any president to him,” she said, adding, without referring to the source: “Statistics speak for themselves.”
Sanders said the briefings would still be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask a question to the US president, it’s better than talking to me.”
We are trying to communicate with the press often. This should be especially noticeable in the last few weeks. The opportunity to talk to the President of the United States is not worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly responds to questions during events outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences with the participation of high-ranking guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is so, in front of journalists, distracted and sometimes speculated.
Scotland’s Secretary of State for Health Affairs has sent a letter to EU workers in connection with fears over Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Secretary of State for Health has sent a letter to citizens of other EU countries working for the National Health Service of Scotland to express their gratitude for their work and to ask them to continue it after Brexit.
Jin Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already undertaken to cover the cost of applications for permanent resettlement for EU citizens working in the autonomous public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman noted: "Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of exit were ongoing. Already this autumn, we should await the appropriate solutions.
But the UK government is stepping up its preparations for a possible exit without a deal.
I know that this period can be very worrying for you.
That is why I would like to emphasize again how I value the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union and countries outside of the European Union share valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving the work of the healthcare service for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home. We really want you to stay."
Christian Ebercrombie has had an emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers midfielder Christian Ebercrombie postponed the emergency operation after receiving a head injury in a Sunday match against Vanderbilt Komodores, which his team lost with a score of 31:27. This was reported by the Tennessee newspaper.
The head coach of the Tennessee State Tigers team told reporters that the player had been injured shortly before the break.
“He approached the sideline where he was hurt,” Reed said.
Over the side line, trainers and medical staff gave Ebercrombie oxygen before picking it up on the carriers for further examination.
An official spokesman for the Tennessee State Tigers team told Chris Harris of WSMV (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercrombie was operating at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no evidence yet of the type and severity of the injury." In the team "Tennessee State Tigers" try to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a second-grader, spent his first season at the Tennessee State Tigers after retiring from the Illinois team.
He made five interceptions of the ball on Sunday before getting out of the game, so he had 18 interceptions for the season.

In the Ministry of Finance is expected to attract an additional 120 million pounds per year to help the homeless
As Theresa May announced today, foreigners who buy real estate in the UK will pay more tariffs. Additional funds will be spent to help the homeless.
This move can be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing targeted at high-paid workers.
The increase in the tariff will apply to natural and legal persons who do not pay taxes in the UK. Additional funds are allocated by the government to help those who are forced to stay overnight in the open air.
The additional duty, which accompanies the increase of the two-year old age on the second housing and the property intended for lease, may be three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to attract an additional 120 million pounds per year.
According to experts, 13% of the new real estate that is being built in London is owned by foreign nationals. This leads to an increase in prices and complicates the task for those who only dream of their own housing.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, are deserted, as a large number of foreign buyers live outside the country most of the time.
The new plan of action came just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a lower state tariff to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices for real estate by buying land without further using it. He called on Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable real estate to correct the "wrong position on the grocery market".
Mr. Corbin has announced a number of important real estate reforms, in particular the control of rents and the impossibility of expulsion without serious grounds.
It also proposes to extend the powers of local councils in the field of construction of new housing.
Theresa May said: “This year I promised to dedicate my premiere to the restoration of the British dream – for every new generation of life should be better.
This requires a change in our imperfect housing market.
The UK will always remain open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
However, it is not possible to call fair the fact that individuals who do not reside in the UK, as well as foreign companies, buy housing on the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become unattainable. The problem of living in the open air is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "First of all, I want to be the head coach of Scotland"
The head coach of FC Sanderland, Jack Ross, claims that “most of all” will ever lead Scotland’s team.
The 42-year-old Scottish has decided to restore the club from the northeast of the country, which is now third in the First League, by three points away from the leader.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Lights this summer, returning last season of FC St Mirren to the Premier League of Scotland.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to the second squad of Scotland, but that’s the end of it,” Ross told BBC Scotland on Sportssound.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the Scottish team play at Hempden Park. It always attracted me.
The only hope for me remains to be successful in the position of the club’s head coach.”
Ross' predecessors at Sanderland FC, in particular, were Dick Attorney, David Moyes, Sam Ellardais, Martin O'Neill, Roy King, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
Former head coach of FC Alloa Athletic says he has not felt the excitement of moving to a big club following such authoritative names, previously rejecting proposals from FC Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the current stage, I will consider that I have achieved success if the club returns to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and material and technical security, this club is undoubtedly in line with the Premier League level,” he said.
“It’s not going to be an easy task, but another result I’m unlikely to consider successful for myself.”
Ross is only building a coaching career for three years. Prior to that, he worked as the second coach at Dumbarton FC, and also spent 15 months at the coaching staff of Garts FC.
He then helped Alloa win after the FC reached the third division, and the following season from St Mirren went from the departure stage to winning the title of the first division.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at FC Clyde, Gartlpool, Folkerk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I was on the crossroads," he recalls, talking about the transition to Alloa FC.
“I honestly believed that coaching was more suitable for me than playing games.
This sounds strange because I was successful, well earned on it and reached certain heights.
But playing is not easy.
There are a lot of challenges that you have to overcome every week.
I still face them, experiencing stress and tension, but as a head coach I feel in my place.
I've always been interested in coaching. I've never felt as comfortable in my adult life as after I chose this profession."

Study: 17:30 on Sunday – the perfect time for a beer bowl
The summer heat has helped increase revenues for British pubs who are experiencing not the best times, but has increased pressure on the network of restaurants.
According to estimates, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The author of the calculations, Peter Martin of the CGA organization, who is engaged in consulting on business development, noted: "Due to the sunny weather and longer than expected, the participation of England in the World Championships was the same as the last of July.
The June decline of 1.8% in July increased.
Pubs and bars, focused on the supply of drinks, so far have the best indicators – the increase in their profits is equivalent to the losses of restaurants.
Puppies, who serve food, also suffered from heat, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that visitors are only interested in a drink.
In the controlled pubs and bars, the sales of beverages increased by 6.6% in a month, while the sales of food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst for leisure and hotel business at RSM, said: “We’ve been seeing similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and large-scale social or sporting events remain the main factors influencing sales on the domestic market.
It is no wonder that groups of restaurants continue to lose profits. The annual sales drop of 4.8% causes special concern against the background of the need to cut costs.
A long hot summer has not come at the best time for the establishments serving food. We will see if the moderate temperature we observed in August will give them such a necessary rest."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, in July amounted to 2.7%, reflecting a slowdown in the market of new brands.
The industry indicator of the sales volume of the Coffer Peach Tracker in the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector is a reflection of the collected and analyzed performance indicators of 47 working groups whose total turnover exceeds <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion.
One in five children has a social media account hidden from their parents.
According to the results of the study, one in five children, sometimes less than 11 years of age, have a hidden account on social networks from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages on Instagram
This news has exacerbated concerns about the possible posting of sexual content
20% of students reported that they have a “basic account” that shows their parents
One in five children, sometimes less than 11 years of age, create an account on social networks that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages on Instagram, the social network for sharing photos.
This news has exacerbated concerns about the possible placement of content of a sexual nature.
20% of students reported that they had a clean “basic” account that shows their parents, as well as one or more private ones.
The mother, who accidentally hit the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw the call “violate me”.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools showed that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two social media profiles. Half of these children admitted that the additional coverage
HMC chairman Mike Buchanan said: “We are very concerned that many teenagers feel the desire to create an online space where parents and teachers will not be able to find them.”
Eileen Doyle to Become "Representative of Athletic Interests" at Scottish Athletics Council
Eileed Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as an independent director during the annual general board of board members.
Doyle is Scotland’s most prestigious lightweight athlete. Chairman of the Board of Directors Yen Bitti called this step a great opportunity for those who lead the sport movement to take advantage of its broad experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys tremendous respect among athletes in Scotland, the UK and the world. We are confident that attracting him to the council will bring enormous benefits to athletics in Scotland," said Beatty.
Doyle noted: "I will be inspired to act as a representative of the interests of athletes. I hope that I can really benefit and promote the development of sport in Scotland."
The American, a four-time Olympic champion who won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, and now a sports watcher for the BBC, lost the opportunity to walk through a transient ischemical attack.
He tweeted, “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors claimed that only time would show if I could recover and how much.
Thanks to my incredible efforts, I was able to recover completely. I again learned to walk and today I perform dynamic exercises!
Thank you for your support!”
In the advertising of lactating women compared with cows – the opinions of internet users shared
The manufacturer of milk vacuum cleaners has faced ambiguous reaction of internet users to advertising, in which young mothers are compared to active cows.
To mark the release of the product, called "the world's first silent natil milk extractor", the technology company consumer goods manufacturer Elvie released an advertisement in the style of a humorous music video to demonstrate the freedom that new mothers enjoy.
Four real mothers dance in a son-filled cowboy under the song, which contains the following words: "Yes, I am feeding myself, but I have no tail" and "As you can see, it's not a whim, it's my breasts."
Next, the choir sings: "To absorb, to absorb, to feed the children. To absorb, to absorb, so that the milk does not waste."
However, the advertising video, posted on the company’s Facebook page, caused a tumultuous discussion online.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. However, the reaction of internet users turned out to be ambiguous. Many noted that the advertisement underestimated the "horrible organization" of milk production in the industry.
“It’s not a very wise decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk. However, their children are removed from them a few days after they are born," – wrote one of the users.
Elvie milk vacuum cleaner can easily be hidden in breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Here’s another comment: “It’s obviously traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not attract them to the advertising of a dairy suction cup for women who need to feed their babies?”
Another added: “This advertisement is very far from reality.”
Other users have intervened to protect the advertising video. One of the women's videos appeared "very fun".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd definitely buy something like this if I were still breastfeeding.
By swallowing the milk, I really felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I didn’t look for hidden content in it.
“It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Here’s another comment: “Cumulative advertising aimed at moms who suck up milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertisement is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, women show milk suction cups hidden in their bra.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on the information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
However, the Elvie vacuum cleaner works absolutely quietly, has no wires or tubes and is easily hidden in the breastfeeding bra. Thanks to this, women can freely move, hold children and even go out on the street.
Ana Ballarin, partner and executive creative director of the advertising agency Mother, commented on the situation: “Elvie’s vacuum cleaner is such a revolutionary product that it required a bright and provocative representation.
Having experienced a parallel between women breastfeeding and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the features of breastfeeding, in an exciting and interesting way demonstrating an incredible sense of freedom, which will bring a new feeling.
The Elvie vacuum cleaner is not the first time in the news headlines.
Within the framework of Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the podium with this product during a show of clothing from the fashion designer Marty Yakubovsky.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policy on the part of the Trump administration has made the process of placing children in custody difficult.
Traditionally, in most cases, the caregivers were the immigrants themselves without documents. Now they are afraid to put at risk their own opportunity to stay in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to provide fingerprints and that these data would be passed on to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, senior executive of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Control, testified before Congress that the Bureau’s staff had arrested dozens of people who had applied for care for unattended minors.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal background.
"About 80% of people who are caregivers or members of their households are illegally in the country. Many of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That is why we continue to persecute these people,” said Mr. Albens.
According to the asylum workers, in order to deal more quickly with the cases of children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear before the court within a month after the detention, rather than 60 days as it was before.
Many of them will be able to use videoconferencing instead of going to court in person to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who, by a court decision, do not have the right to receive asylum, will be deported quickly.
According to workers’ asylum and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they will be to experience anxiety or depression. This can cause outbreaks of violence or attempted escape.
Rights defenders argue that these problems are escalating in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological condition of children.
They added that by moving the children to a tent town and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends, we risk aggravating the injury that many of them have already suffered.
Syria orders US, France and Turkey 'occupied forces' to immediately withdraw troops
In addition, speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war is already ongoing in the country for the eighth year.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the guise of combating terrorism, so "their treatment will be appropriate".
“They have to go immediately and not put conditions,” he said at the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war on terrorism is actually over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has deployed about 2,000 military personnel in Syria. They are mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In the devastated country of war, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
With regard to refugees, Mualem assured that the country has created the right conditions for their return. He also accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unfounded fears" because of which refugees do not dare to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to the return of the people,” he said.
"We're seeing an attempt to politicize the purely humanitarian problem."
The U.S. and the European Union have warned that they will not provide Syria with assistance in the restoration of the country until a political agreement has been concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib, the last major siege of rebels, has created an opportunity for the continuation of political negotiations.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkish agreement, it was possible to prevent a large-scale offensive of the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, into the province, where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement has "clear terms" and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including Al-Qaeda-linked militants from the al-Nusra Front, who "will be destroyed."
U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Mualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying his work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why will Trump be re-elected?
Under this logic, Trump could be re-elected in 2020, if, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, he will not be empowered prematurely after the scandal and impeachment.
Without a doubt, this would be “the most dramatic end of the presidency of all time”!
At the moment, viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of spectators in the prime time has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on CNN and actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News had an average of 2.4 million prem-time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on the cable channel MSNBC was at the top of the new ranking with 3.5 million viewers.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our understanding," said Neil Ber, executive drama producer of Last Candidate on ABC's channel about the secretary of state who becomes president after a devastating attack on the capital.
Nell Scowell, an experienced writer-humorist and author of the book "Just Funny Moments: as well as a few harsh truths about penetration into the Hollywood Men's Club" proposes a different theory.
She recalled a trip in a Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"Because he's laughing at me," he said. That's the story Mrs. Skowell told me.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, unlike any other TV content, the history of Washington is capable of defining the future of Row vs. Wade's case, the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
Dissidence is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed by the Washington Post, and you're watching six hours after a group of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward's "well-known" sources, the writing for his book "Fear", the scare of the jacket of Paul.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the same again.
"The feeling of the reality show is partly related to the fact that you get something new every evening," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the TV show "The Stars of the Lombard", about the rotation in the cast.
If you allow yourself to miss a body one episode, you can hopelessly delay.
When I was able to meet Mr. Fleiss this week at his house on the north coast of the island of Kawai, there was a warm, sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording NCN.
He could not break away from the TV – not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Legal Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging on his hair.
“I remember how we created all those crazy shows back in time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleas told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but I think they were right.”

External inputs of funds in the toughest interim elections in Congress
It’s no wonder that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is targeted for additional cash inputs, because through a review of the electoral districts, two current congressmen compete for one chair.
In the fight for this suburban district of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed, enters a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb, who won another district in the additional elections last spring.
Lemb opposes another current congressman, Republican Kit Roths, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders coincide significantly with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old boundaries of the districts were defined in favor of Republicans contrary to the constitution.
The pre-election races in the new 17th district have sparked a fierce confrontation between the financial divisions of the main parties, the U.S. Democratic Party Committee on Congressional Elections (DCCC) and the Republican National Committee (NRC).
Lemba's surname became well known in Pennsylvania after a win with a minimal advantage in the 18th district during the additional elections to Congress in March, which were enjoyed by the general public.
This place belonged to Republicans for more than a decade. President Donald Trump won in this county with a 20-point advantage.
Political experts have given a small advantage to the Democrats.
The U.S. considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but changed its mind
Diplomats reminded of Washington’s weak resistance to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama. Earlier, Trump also had a hotel in Panama, until the partners pulled out staff hired by the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to revoke the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions on Taiwan’s non-recognition,” said the Department’s spokeswoman, Geezer Neuert.
But the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, in particular in the area of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted restrictions on visa issuance, would be painful for this Central American country with its high levels of unemployment and murder.
According to the results of the internal council of officials from the states of North and Central America postponed the conference at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity. A similar event passed by the United States of America last year, and it was considered as a step forward.
But by mid-September, senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place. In fact, on this consideration the issue of sanctions against El Salvador ceased.
According to the diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence is now planning to speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October, as a sign that the administration considers this event very important.
At the same time, three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, because there were no new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions, which were reported by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, on condition of anonymity.
The information provided by them was confirmed by a third-party analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history of
The next inconvenience may be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on a possible obstruction of justice by Trump, a weighty confirmation of why can be found in the public information now available.
As part of his investigation, Mueller is verifying a possible link between the Trump campaign and the attack on our voting system by Russia.
If the influence in Congress goes to other hands, Trump will have to report to Congressmen, as well as to voters and, ultimately, to one party.
There is a lot of "if" in this case, and I don't want to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, like his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler if only the West began to resist him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history is determined by such fractured moments, and the unrestrained movement of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
There are a number of such breakthrough myths awaiting Americans now.
What will we do if Trump releases Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a person whose fate depends on Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein fell into a trap when the newspaper reported that he had offered to covertly record talks with the president this year and shared his thoughts on Trump’s position’s inadequacy.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccurate.
“How do we react if the investigation into the case against Brett Kavanaugh, which the FBI recently started, proves to be insufficiently careful or honest, or if Kavanaugh’s candidacy for office in the Supreme Court is not approved, despite the convincing allegations and prosecutions?
And, first of all, will we vote in the medium term for those members of Congress who will be able to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I don't think we're going to give up because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Saturday candles on a swastika table.
Having such a legacy, can I not look with optimism in the future?”

Graham Dorrans with the Rangers with optimism awaiting a meeting with the Viet Nam Rapid
FC "Rangers" accepts "Rapid" (Viden) on Thursday. After a stunning nothing in Spain in the game with "Villarreal" at the beginning of this month victory over the Austrians. Scottish club will provide good odds on the wicket
Due to knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in a game with "Villarreal", which ended with a score of 2:2. However, he believes that FC "Rangers" can use this result as a trump for the trophy.
"For us, it was a good result, because Vilarreal is a strong team," said the 31-year-old.
“We went out to the game in the hopes of getting something body and got one point.
Maybe at the end of the game we could go forward, but overall, no one can probably think of it as a fair result.
In the first time the opponent was better, but after the break we corrected the situation in our favor.
There will be another important confrontation in the European League on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it will not be easy. Our future opponents have shown a good result in their last game. However, we can count on the support of the fans. I am sure we will be able to give the fight and get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been a tough year, starting with my injuries and ending with changes in the club itself. But now the situation has normalized.
We have a great team, and all the guys are satisfied. Training is going well.
"I hope we can go further, leave behind last season and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of the islands for retirement savings
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they would like to organize caring for themselves, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the study by Nationwide said they had talked to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of respondents talked about it with children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not in a hurry to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Unit.
Here's what you need to start with.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family will not be able to provide you with the necessary care unless you inform your relatives of your wishes in advance.
Consult with your consultant and family to determine where and how to receive care, as this choice can become an important factor in determining the cost.
Attract a financial advisor: he can advise you on how to cover the relevant costs.
Sources of long-term care financing include traditional insurance policy, hybrid life insurance policy, or self-sustainment at the expense of your own funds (as long as you have money).
Carefully prepare legal documents: this will allow you to avoid legal harassment in advance.
Prepare confidence for your representative, who will monitor your medical care and ensure that the specialists fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to do so personally.
In addition, we recommend to establish the confidence at the disposal of cash.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills in case of your incapacity.
Do not forget about minor details. Imagine that one of your older parents needs urgent medical attention, so he is taken to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about allergies and medications?
Write down this information to be ready.
"It's not just about finances. It's important who are doctors," Martin says, -
What medications can be taken and
Who takes care of the dog?
Prepare a plan like that.”
In Ilfracombe, a man shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man was shot several times from a pneumatic rifle when he returned home from the party.
The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which occurred at 2:30 p.m. in British time, as "accidental".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His wounds are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a severe earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, but the number of casualties could increase.
Due to the exit from the system of communications, officials dealing with the issue of humanitarian aid cannot get any information from the Dongal regency, the area north of Palu, which is located near the epicenter of the earthquake, magnetium 7.
After the natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are a few basic facts about the city of Palu and the regency of Dongal located on the island of Sulawesi.
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an approximate population of 379,800 people according to data for 2017.
When the earthquake that caused the tsunami occurred, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the data for 2017 in the regency, the administrative region, located in the lower part of the province, lives approximately 299,200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic sectors of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but mainly concentrated in Moroval, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian agency for mitigating the consequences of natural disasters in the past 100 years, Palu and Dongal have been hit by the tsunami several times.
In 1938, more than 200 people died as a result of the tsunami in Dongal and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongal, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Fire Ring and is suffering from earthquakes on a regular basis.
Below are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a severe earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceg, located in the north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, resulting in an earthquake along the coast of the Indian Ocean that killed about 2 000 people.
2005: In late March in early April, a series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-point magnitude earthquake hit the southernmost island of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that struck the southern coastline, killing about 700 people.
2009: Near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra, recorded an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-point magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters in height, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Pidjaya Regency in Aceg Province, causing devastation and panic due to the fact that people have not yet managed to forget the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There were no tsunamis this time, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapse of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many homes, and thousands of tourists were unable to leave the island at once.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Tracey Pailin, the son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Pailin, was arrested on charges of the attack.
According to a report published Saturday by Alaska state police, 29-year-old Pailin from Vasily, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged with obstructing a report of rape and harassment.
According to the police report, when a familiar woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he picked up a phone from her.
According to KTUU, Pailin is in custody in the Matanusk-Suttin investigative instalment with the right to impose a bond of <0x24>500.
He stood in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent" when asked if he confessed to his guilt.
Pailine is charged with three A-class offences, including a one-year arrest and a fine of <0x24>250,000.
He is also charged with Class B offences, which is punishable by a day of imprisonment and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Pauline.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Pailin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, as well as of obstructing the report of domestic violence and carrying a gun in an alcoholic state when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said that he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans for justifying her son’s cruel behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.

The 7.5-point earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Telecommunications and power supply networks are out of operation, and the number of casualties may increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the center of the island of Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The video, which is distributed on social media, shows the moment when the subject hit.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the shore.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for Suspect in New York Attack
In New York, federal prosecutors demand the death penalty of Saifullo Saipov, suspected in a terrorist attack in New York, which resulted in the deaths of eight people – a rare sentence that was not applied in the state for a federal 19-year sentence.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov, driving a truck rented at Home Depot, went on a bicycle path along the road in West Side, Lower Manhattan, and began to hit the cyclists and pedestrians who were hit by the road.
According to a report on the intention to achieve execution, filed in the Southern District of New York State to justify the death penalty, the accused must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" killed the suspects.
According to the court documents, each of these indictments provides for the possibility of the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Judiciary has filed an indictment of Saipo for 22 points, in particular eight counts of murder with a view to prosecution, which is usually also prosecuted by federal prosecutors and prosecutors in cases linked to the body.
According to prosecutors, who described Saipo’s crime as “horrible, cruel and malicious,” the attack was the result of “mighty planning and premeditated thought.”
Victims of Saifulla Habibullaevich Saipov's injuries, injuries or deaths were Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cléves, Anne-Laurent Decadt, Darren O'Reilly Drake, Ariel Earl, Ernan Ferrucci, and Ernan Ferrucci.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last time a criminal case in New York’s Southern District was violated, which is punishable by the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers, and was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty for a federal case was brought to execution in New York in 1953. The couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy in favor of the Soviet Union during the cold
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the jury, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not demonstrate evidence of conscience in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigator that he did not regret the incident.
According to the indictment, Saipov informed the authorities that he was inspired to carry out an ISIL video attack, which he watched on his phone.
The police reported that he also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He did not plead guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to pursue the death penalty, rather than accepting the confession of guilt and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only intensify the psychological trauma caused by these events to all victims,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense party has also earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
MEP from the Conservative Party believes that NEEDING FARAJA should be appointed responsible for the negotiations on Brexit
Today, during the protest campaign at the Conservative Party's summit, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the People's Army".
Former UK Independence Party leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" of European skeptics as one of the MPs, Theresa May, proposed his candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party deputy Peter Boone said on the march in Birmingham that the UK "would already come out" if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
Attention to the problems May faced in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks was even more attracted by the fact that MPs from the Conservative Party who opposed the exit joined a special protest campaign in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is trying to bring Chequers’ compromise plan to life, despite the attacks by Brexit supporters, those against the exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will not abandon the attempt to negotiate with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what it offers and "chaos".
At the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihali, Mr. Boone said he wanted to “resign from the Chequers.”
He offered to Mr Farage to step out of the shadows and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for it, we would have gone out," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to give up the Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We fought in world wars not to submit.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Boone rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, public opinion changed: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and do not want to go out is absolutely unrealistic.”
A member of the Conservative Party and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, told reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists, who actually walk the streets and fight for votes of voters.
Please reject the Chequers and start listening.”
In an address to Theresa May, she added: "The prime ministers retain their position when they keep their promises."
Farage said that politicians should "feel pressure" if they are going to give up the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us, the people and our political elite," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them it won’t get out of their hands.”
In a message to the crowd full of enthusiasm, he added: “I want our political elite, who is planning to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel pressure.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never calm down until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the opponents of the exit passed through Birmingham, and then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists were swayed by “Conservators Against Brexit” banners after the group launched this weekend.
Labour lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives because security problems arose after the opening of the conference through their party program.
“These are people who tell us they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, well-organized borders, free trade with Ireland,” he said.
"It's a complete farce.
There’s nothing good about Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “think seriously” about voting for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she “thinks seriously about voting for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during a general assembly in West Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts spoke about its future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, runs for a second term in November against Republican Party member Jeff Dyle, who was the co-chair of Trump’s campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is considered as the main candidate, which can deal with Trump in 2020.
On Saturday, she held her 36th meeting with voters in a general assembly format since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to take part in the presidential election.
Warren replied that “it’s time for women to go to Washington and set up a government, and for this, there must be a woman in charge.”
Arrested suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Sims with a gun
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wade Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dion Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person on it.
A 20-year-old Sims was shot on campus at the University of Southend on Friday morning.
"Wayd Sims suffered a gunshot wound to his head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade surrendered to his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, it was found that Simpson was at the scene of the crime, had a gun with him, and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was detained in the police department of East Baton County.
Sims, whose growth was 6 feet and 6 inches and who played in the junior league, grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 stars last season and spent an average of 17.9 minutes per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton cuts the delay in the fight for the World Champion title after the team decided to give him a victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the moment Walter Bottas left behind Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes’ team decisions will play a significant role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the pole position and almost bypassed Hamilton, who tried to maintain his position in the first two laps and gave Fettel the opportunity to attack his comrade on the team.
Fettel went to the pit-stop first and left Hamilton on the track in the middle of the race, which had to decide everything.
The Mercedes team's pilot walked another wheel and went behind Fettel, but Hamilton jumped into the leader after a certain wheel-to-wheel maneuver, as a result of which the Ferrari driver was unwilling to leave the car in the trunk of the inner space, if the risk was that it would be his own.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstopen started from the back row of the net and remained in seventh place until the end of the first round.
Sweatshirt he led most of the race as he did not change tires to quickly come to the finish and hold Kimi Rikkonen from fourth place.
As a result, he stopped at the pit-stop in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the pace in the last eight, which made Rikkonen fourth place.
“It’s a tough day because Waltire was taught full-time on all weekends and showed nobility when he gave me the opportunity to walk.
The team has done exceptional work to occupy first and second place,” said Hamilton.
The language of the body was not impressed.
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Finnstein for her firm position that she did not disclose the content of a letter by Christine Blaise Ford, which accuses the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly turn to the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Legal Committee, but instead expressed his opinion on the events in the Senate, which, according to him, demonstrated human "death, death."
“The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that have happened in the last few days in the Senate, is anger, you see bad people demonstrating sexuality, ugliness, and lies,” he said.
“You look at the publications and the information that’s being released, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Diane Finnstein, did you disclose the information?
Remember her answer... Did you disclose the contents of the documents? – “What?
Oh, no.
I didn’t announce.”
Hold on a minute.
We made it public?... No, we didn’t make it public,” he added, copying the senator’s behavior.
In July, Finnstein received a letter detailing the allegations made by Ford against Kavanaugh, and in early September its contents were made public, but Finnstein denied that the leak had occurred in her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t disclose the information I received from her,” Finnstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it a secret, and I didn’t break my promise.”
However, her objection apparently displeased the president, who commented during the Saturday rally: “I’ll tell you, her body language was not at all impressed.
Maybe she didn’t do that, but I haven’t seen anyone hold any worse.”
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, which three women have been accused of sexual violence, the president assumed that Democrats are using the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to return power in any necessary way, in any way.
You see sexuality, ugliness, anything to insult them, through whom to step in to gain power and control,” Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: "Dandy Stars" – "Belfast Giants", 5:3
Jaiants player Patrick Dwyer has dropped two laundry in the match against Dandey
Dani Stars were rehabilitated for Friday's defeat in the elite league against the Belfast Giants, winning the match on Saturday with a score of 5:3.
The Jaiants were given an early lead in two laundry due to the boys Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowlier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney scored in the home match, and then Dwyer again pushed the Jayants forward.
Dani player Francois Bushar scored, and two goals by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
This is the third in the elite league season to defeat Adam Keif, who won a freelance victory over the Dandy with a 2:1 score on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth team match of the season. Three previous matches won by the Jayants.
Dwyer left the first laundry in the fourth minute (3:35) after transferring Kendall McFall, and four minutes later Bowley, who received the laundry from David Reserford, doubled the bill.
After the tense first period in the fourteenth minute (13:10) Sullivan returned the owners of the field to the game, and in the sixteenth minute (15:16) Cooney, having received a wash from Matt Markward, leveled the score.
Dwyer gave the Jayants a preference before the first break, dropping his second laundry at the end of the first period.
The masters of the field regrouped, and Bushar scored again for the twenty-eighth minute (27:37) by dropping the laundry when his team was overnumbered.
Thanks to the efforts of Cooney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, he first pushed the Dandy forward and secured his team's victory in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Jayants team, which has already lost four of the last five games, will play a departure match against Milton-Kines.
Airplane controller died so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid the earthquake
The airliner in Indonesia was declared a hero after he helped to fly a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his own life.
More than 800 people were killed and many lost their lives after a severe tsunami on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong underground clashes continue to shake this area, many people found themselves under the cliffs in the city of Palu.
However, unlike his colleagues who fled to save his life, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the heavily dispersed management tower at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufi Airport in Palu.
He remained in place to make sure that flight 6321 of the airline Batik Air, which was at the time on the landing strip, safely took off into the air.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going to be destroyed.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesian air navigation service provider Johannes Siright said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which is supposed to deliver it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are very sorry to hear about it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of casualties could reach thousands as the country’s mitigation agency says access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi and Butong is restricted.
"The number of victims can increase, as many bodies are still under wreckage, and many of them cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, devastated the city of Palu, in which mass burials will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger jets provide assistance and food supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulance brings the body.
Clean water is not enough.
Mini-markets are plundered everywhere.”
The chairman of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helfand, told CNN: “Indonesia’s Red Cross is in a hurry to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s military personnel: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
“Are you ready?” she told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia suffered from earthquakes on the island of Lombok, which resulted in the deaths of more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: as stated in Air Niugini, after the plane crashed into the lagoon one man disappeared
The airline that operated the flight, which suffered a disaster in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now states that one person has disappeared, although previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated from the island.
Air Niugini said it was not possible to find a passenger on Saturday.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find the man and cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to do so.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request to provide more detailed information about the passenger, for example, about his age and nationality.
The local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men were taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the aircraft landed in the lagoon near the landing strip.
Some witnesses believe that the aircraft flew a landing strip.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane flew very low above the ground.
"It's very good," said Janes.
Janes said that he and others managed to get to the emergency exits on a drowning plane while on the belt in the water.
He said the stewards were panicking and screaming, and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors who were working near the refurbishment also helped in the rescue operation, bringing people to shore with the help of an inflatable boat before the plane drowned at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network in the last two decades, 111 people have died in air crashes linked to PNG airlines, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
Analyst restored the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution broke the case against a man accused of sleeping women from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Roulette testified as an expert in the field of operative development for several hours.
He told members of the jury how he used cell phone records to reproduce the movement of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Roulette, according to The Clarion Ledger, said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous claim.
When the data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Senford, police went to talk to the latter.
On Saturday, Sanford testified and said that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was at the Sanford pickup that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my pickup was in Neshville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Records of telephone conversations indicated that they knew each other for only a week.
Roulette said that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis had removed text messages, calls and contact information from Chambers' phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Gail said.
The defendant must make his final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects that the trial will be handed over to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
Trio hip-hop performers want to challenge a negative view of the genre, filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed group from Bristol argues that hip-hop has changed its nature – it has withdrawn from political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the leaks and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed the revival of this trend in the UK thanks to groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
In New York, the nanny filed a lawsuit for the couple's release after receiving a "racist" message
In New York, a nurse filed a divorce lawsuit after receiving a misdirected message from her mother complaining that she was "another black woman."
The spouse denies that they are racist, comparing the lawsuit to the “prosecution.”
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new nurse, Giselle Morris, who arrived on her first day of work in 2016, was dark.
“No, there will be one theme,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Morris twice.
As the New York Post reports, conscious of her mistake, Mrs. Plaxson-Flaxman felt "inconvenient" and released Mrs. Morris. She stated that their previous nurse, who was an African-American, did poorly her job and that Fkunchy was instead a warrior.
Miss Morris was paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple in court, hoping to get a compensation for the amount of compensation she would have received for six months of work with the spouse she was initially hired, although without a contract. She had to pay <0x24>350 to.
“I want to show them that we don’t have to do that,” she said on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
In response to accusations that they were racist, the couple claimed that the release of Morris was a reasonable decision because they feared they would not be able to trust her after being offended.
“My wife didn’t mean what I sent her.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children with a man who has been brutally treated, even if it wasn’t intentional?
Your baby's?
"NATURAL".
By comparing the lawsuit to the “complaint,” Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a child only two months ago and had “not yet swallowed.”
“Would you take revenge on someone after that?”
It’s a bad thing,” added the investment banker.
While the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
As told in the new letter, Padington’s publishers feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear capable of speaking
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born almost immediately after the book was agreed to be printed, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of the first person who reads the book before it was published.
It’s funny now, because we know about the huge success that Padington’s story has made.”
Talking about the fact that her father, who worked as a BBC operator, before the little toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, optimistically thought that his work had been rejected, she was divided as on the 60th anniversary of the holiday.
Regarding Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", Karen added that her father was silently proud that the book had become so popular.
“He was a fairly modest person and didn’t like to brag,” she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, like his own child! After all, when children achieve something, we're proud of them, although it's not theirs, not our victories.
I think he looked at Padington's success that way.
Although Paddington was the creation of his imagination, he always attributed success to him.”
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye by phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to a hospital called Louis Pasteur in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
“I was on a regular phone call, saying that everything was really bad, that she shouldn’t have done it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"And then Nad called me and said she was going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The medicines that doctors gave her to keep her heart battering gradually stopped acting and left the body.
She died a while before it was all disconnected.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing what was going on at this time.
I couldn’t cry, cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to hold myself in my hands.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who was burning for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, not paying attention to the severe tests she had to undergo.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I lowered my head and couldn’t hold my tears.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to deeply sympathize with Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two women who have been sad leave postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women, who have lost loved ones due to suicide, work to prevent others from putting their hands on themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys leave on the Welsh bridge postcards with phone numbers that people can call for support, as well as messages that would inspire them.
The son of Miss Davis Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he put his hands on himself.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the same as I do every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Linda, said her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
Everyone knew him for a smile.
They’ve always said that this smile made any room lighter.”
But he quit his job before he died because he was “like in the dark.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, found his brother's body after he put his hands on himself.
Miss Davis says, "I'm constantly afraid that this will have consequences."
Miss Davis created postcards, "so that people know that there are those they can turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don’t get stuck in yourself, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Hamfries, who had been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost her husband Mark, with whom she had lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was feeling depressed, he was depressed or something,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that it had changed.”
And on Christmas day, he was completely stunned by the spirit. When the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eyes."
She said that his death had become a huge trauma to them, but they had to survive it: "It has imposed a devastating

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs on his hair: FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could get what we asked for – limited in time and nature of the investigation – we might have reached a certain agreement,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be “released” against the backdrop of an unprecedented loss.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their unwillingness is related to time.
Interim elections will take place in just five weeks, November 6. If the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will seriously complicate their attempts to hold their own person in the country's Supreme Court through elections.
George W. Bush telephoned senators asking to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush's rule and who was the reason he met his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
The Senate, which now has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes at a Senate meeting, which would allow Vice President Mike Pens to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy for the seat of the judge.
During Kim's rule, the number of North Korean runners "reduced"
After Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of fugitives from North Korea to South Korea has decreased, the South Korean legislator said.
Park Pyongyang, referring to the data of the Ministry of Association of the Republic of South Korea, said last year the number of runners was 1,127 compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors were the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers who transport illegals are now demanding more money for it.
In Pyongyang, they abstained from public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean runners eventually offer South Korea’s citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea. It is easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them forcibly.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still formally in a state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed the issue of denuclearization, the negotiations on which came to a halt.
This took place after the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in common terms to cooperate on the Korean Peninsula’s nuclear disarmament.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ree Yon-ho, accused the United States of not making progress since then, against the backdrop of sanctions.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no unilateral disarmament,” Ree Yon-Hoo said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the seat of Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he is not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've been thinking all along that if a woman ever did that, she'd be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi commented on her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his inaugural speech, Kavanaugh acted very emotionally, at times almost screaming and reluctantly discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him an “absurd and coordinated destruction of reputation” organized by liberals who were outraged by Hillary Clinton’s loss of the 2016 presidential election.
According to Pelosi, Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as this showed his prejudice towards the Democrats.
“I think with these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he will take his candidacy on his own,” she said.
Pelosi was angry when asked if she would try to declare Kavanaugh's impeachment if his guilt was confirmed, and whether Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say this: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not only suitable for working in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is currently working,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Columbia County.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the “Affordable Medical Service” law or the “Row vs. Wade” case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings on the question of approval to the position, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would annul some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not the time when a judge becomes a hysterical, prejudiced person and we’ll tell you how great it is,” Pelosi said.
Women need to have these weapons in place.
These are just words that have been accumulated for months and years in anger, and she could not utter them without tears.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Stein told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, do you?”
She continued: "One woman who worked as the CEO somewhere and helped me a lot, said she was crying when she was angry, too, but she had her own methodology. When she was angry and started crying, she said to the interviewer, "Because of me, you can guess what.
I am evil.”
And after that, she just continued.
I thought it was unbelievable.”
Tears are considered to be an acceptable way out of anger, in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my clearest memories of the first job in the office, in which mostly men worked, was the situation when I once cried out of unspeakable rage, and the older woman – a disrespectful manager, who was always a little afraid of me –
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re mad.
They will think that you are sad, and they will rejoice that they have come to you.”
Patricia Schröder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Garth in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was caught on an extramarital connection aboard a boat called Monkey Business, after which he came out of the race, deeply disappointed Miss Schröder decided that there was no reason she could not run for president.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates have already participated in the race, and another candidate is the last thing they needed.”
Someone called the situation "The Snow White and the Seven Gnomes".
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she dropped out of fundraising, so she promised herself that she would not take part in the race if she did not raise <0x24>2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not hurt the support of men for <0x24>1,000, gave her only <0x24>250.
“Do you think they’ll give me a discount?” she wondered.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was covered with emotions – gratitude to the people who supported her, disappointment with the system, which made it very difficult to collect money and forced her to focus on the voters not so much, as she was a member.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schröder recalled the press reaction.
You would think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they would write on my graveyard?
“She was crying?”
How the trade war between the US and China could bring Beijing advantage
Experts believe that the first steps in the U.S.-China trade war have been despairing and, while still far ahead of its completion, the long-term divide between the countries may benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning shots earlier this year, taxing major Chinese export goods, including solar batteries, steel and aluminum.
The situation worsened this week due to new tariffs on goods worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), which actually taxed half of all goods coming to the U.S. from China.
Beijing has paid back the same coin each time, recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on US goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has pledged to take similar US measures, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to miss the opportunity in the near future to keep that promise.
Forcing Washington to step down means agreeing to the demands, but for President Xi Jinping, public worship of the United States is too shameful.
However, if Beijing is properly exploited, the pressure in the U.S. trade war could bring China a long-term advantage by decreasing the ties between the two economies.
"A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic downturn in any of the countries. And this is actually a greater threat than the Center's observers have previously acknowledged. Azhariya's Newcastle analyst said.
Foreign Minister Says Syria is “ready” for the Return of Refugees
In Syria, they say they are ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seek help in the restoration of a country devastated by the war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the real situation has become more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can return to normal life.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave due to terrorism have been created, as well as unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and limited their means of existence.
According to the UN, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said the Syrian government would be pleased to accept assistance in the restoration of the war-torn country.
But he stressed that they will not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that support the siege.
Europe confirms victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team won the Ryder Cup in 2018, when it won the U.S. team with a score of 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
For the sixth time in a row, the U.S. team has been defeated in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup tournament since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who tried most of the tournament, broke his first long-distance strike on the 16th Par-3 moon in the water and took over to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won in all of his rounds and became one of four players who have ever scored 5–0–0 since the start of the tournament in the modern format in 1979.
American Jordan Spitt was defeated with a score of 5:4 by a player with the lowest rating in the European team Turbiern Olesen from Denmark.
Justin Johnson, who takes the first place in the world rankings, scored 2:1 by John Polter from England, who may have taken part in the Ryder Cup tournament last time.
Spanish Sergio García, a veteran of the Ryder Cup, who has already participated in the tournament eight times, became the European who has won the most tournaments of all time, bringing 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It’s the team’s merit, and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said, without restraining his emotions after winning in Europe.
He passes the staff to his compatriot John Rem, who on Sunday won the American golf legend Tiger Woods in a solitary game with a score of 2:1.
“I’m incredibly proud of winning Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four games in France and now has a career record for the Ryder Cup tournament 13–21–3.
Strange statistics for one of the most outstanding players of all time, who won 14 Major tournaments, relegating only to Jack Nicholas.
The U.S. team attempted to reach the Fervey area over the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finn, who showed high-end golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furick said of his team after an unpleasant speech: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we dominated Europe for a long time.
We fought.
I'm taking off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the U.S. Golf Professionals Association and the Raider Cup tournament committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their captain.
They cannot be commended.
We lost.”
