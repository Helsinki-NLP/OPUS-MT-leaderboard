Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on the introduction of administrative responsibility for the violation of the time and order of payment of goods (works, services) when making purchases for state and municipal needs.
This law is designed to address the very acute problem of non-compliance with its obligations by customers in the execution of public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation, when entrepreneurs could not receive payment for already executed state and municipal contracts, was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia ordered the Attorney General of the Russian Federation to take the problem on special control.
Because the businessmen themselves were unable to cope with unfaithful customers who entered into unfunded contracts, they tried to evade payment obligations and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public contracts by the prosecutor's office submitted 9.7 thousand submissions, according to the results of their examination, 4.5 thousand officials submitted to disciplinary responsibility, in administrative cases - 533, from prosecution to prosecution bodies of 46
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs amounted to more than 66 billion rubles.
And these huge sums were accumulated by far not as a result of the non-payment of multi-billion-dollar contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs have resulted in more modest amounts.
Here's a typical case.
The head of a small company won a competition for the provision of social transport services for several million rubles.
The man invested all his turnover funds, fully fulfilled the obligations, but the money put in the time did not receive.
The result is a growing financial comma of debts on wages, taxes, loans, which would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not seek help from the prosecutor’s office.
In a number of regions, the problem has now been maximized.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts, identified by prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt ratios continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor ' s office operates in the manual anti-crisis management mode.
The Prosecutor-General personally holds travel meetings with local authorities, in which they are subjectively aware of all violations committed by the prosecutors and the measures taken to remedy them immediately.
Such operational meetings have already taken place this year in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
Qualitatively improve the payment discipline of public contractors will be able to implement the Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendment to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in relation to the determination of the liability of the public contractor, and the burden of administrative liability of the client for the breach.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Prosecutor General’s Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences article, which provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by the official of the customer of the term and order of payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
And if an official has already been subject to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he is expected to be disqualified for a period of one year to two years.
All prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative novels in practice.
Civil Rights Protection Team Announces Movement Warning in Missouri
The National Association for Promoting the Progress of the Colored Population has issued a warning to the colored people traveling to Missouri because of the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group’s statement reads as follows: “The National Association of Travellers’ Warning to Promote the Progress of the Colored Population, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, guests and citizens of Missouri to be especially attentive and uplifted.
According to the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Colored Population, the announcement of the movement warning group prompted a law recently adopted in Missouri that made it harder for people to win claims related to their own discrimination, as well as the fact that law enforcement agencies are not prosecuted.
“You have people who are violating human rights.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of the skin, they are beaten and killed,” Rod Chepel, president of the National Association of Promoting the Progress of the Colored People of Missouri, told the Kansas City Star newspaper.
“We hear complaints more often than ever before.”
This is the first warning of this kind announced by the organization in relation to the United States.
The group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on a racial basis at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had run out of gasoline during a trip to the state, and Missouri police arrested him without prosecuting him for the crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Missouri State Attorney General’s Office that says the probability of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 percent higher than for white drivers.
“The goal of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared in one way or another, whether they will take the money for the bail or inform relatives that they are traveling through the territory of the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI’s hate crime report program, 100 hate crimes were registered in Missouri in 2015, making the state the sixteenth state in the number of such violations.
Moving alerts are also a response to the new Missouri law, after which it will be more difficult to initiate a case against a legal person in connection with housing or labour discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Protection Union (ACLU) announced warnings for travelers in Texas and Arizona after these states passed new immigration control laws, according to which local law enforcement had been ordered to recognize that AC people were arrested for violations of the law.
Traffic warnings are usually issued by the State Department in respect of other countries, but public organizations have recently resorted to this in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed as a result of shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
An unidentified police patrol was shot in the Egyptian city of Isna, according to Reuters, referring to the Ministry of the Interior of Egypt.
During the shooting, two people, including one policeman, were killed and three people were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the attackers was detained, the other managed to hide.
Rostourism Endorses Law on Cancellation of Free Baggage for Non-Return Airline Tickets
The head of Rostourism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with the RBC TV channel that it is "positive" to the adoption of the law on the cancellation of free baggage transport on non-return air tickets.
“It is necessary to create conditions in which a person who does not have baggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has baggage,” he stressed.
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the concerns of the citizens, it will not be necessary to pay for the transportation of top clothes and mobile phone in the handheld.
“It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and to declare it, to say that it will not be related to the top clothes, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the iPad, or even to some computer,” Rosturism said.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law that provides for the right of airlines to exclude the norm on free luggage transportation in case of non-returnable air travel.
This means that the airline can determine the number of seats and the weight of the luggage included in the non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate the pollution of Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the protection of Baikal that in recent years, significant areas of the lake have been exposed to extreme pollution.
He ordered to identify sources of funding, plans and executives for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also ordered a full-fledged recovery of contaminated territories.
"It is also necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the cleaning facilities of most of them are worn out," - quotes the president's RIA Novosti.
He also added that the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the area of the lake there are problems associated with the appearance of natural debris and a number of violations in the field of ecology by the holiday organizers.
“I want to emphasize this: not everything is checked in a row, the measure needs to be known here too, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures,” he said.
Earlier, the Prosecutor-General reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed increasing the number of facilities under environmental supervision.
On June 15, Vladimir Putin in a straight line declared the need to amend the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural areas of special protection.
He was informed of problems with the conduct of economic activities by the inhabitants of the island of Olkhon, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature Sergei Donskaya immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the water protection zone of Baikal, but the Buryatia government reminded that such a change is insufficient, as the restrictions are associated with a number of regulatory acts.
Previously, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A new temple will appear in the South.
In the village of Sosva, members of the community from representatives of indigenous minority peoples of the North "Rakhtyya", together with the inhabitants of the Berezovsky district participate in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderman.
Its location - the river bank, the temple will be well visible from a distance, so it will serve as a road light for fishermen.
According to the representatives of the community, the construction work will be completed this year, now domes are installed, church bells are available.
The Igrim REB fleet provided transportation support.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Miracle Maker, as it is revered by the Orthodox Church as a patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosvet, fishing gives the settlers a job, feeds them.
The locals wait for the temple to open its doors, and the children even write about it in school papers as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the Death Penalty.
Why are laws being followed in Singapore?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an open-air dining room.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after the other, while the oaks carefully store an iron box caught with him from the office.
At the end of the conversation, the businessman heades to the nearest urn - a hundred yards - and throws bulls there.
A fine for garbage in a public place is <0x24>500, Chang said.
You know, I've just developed a reflex since childhood: you can't throw a fantasy from a candy to a bridge, it's immediately penalized.
And now there are video cameras everywhere.
And indeed - Singapore's streets in the center of the city are clean, as in a museum.
Chang says three months ago, an 18-year-old son of his neighbor drew graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the man guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to death.
What?!
Just imagine it.
He got ten shots with a wooden stick on the berries and spent a week in prison.
Physical punishments are not uncommon.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly strict laws, the AIF observer understood on the spot.
No one here thinks of abolishing the death penalty, explains lawyer Victor Li Hong.
And the government has long cared about the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this.
If a person carries a large batch of drugs or trades them, he or she has an expulsion.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport, carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even Pope Rome.
In the end, however, he was hanged.
After that, the drug traffickers are taking care of our country.
The case is as follows: in Singapore it is stipulated that the laws are obliged to observe ALL in a row, not just the modest and poor people.
It doesn’t matter who you are – a millionaire, a deputy prime minister, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
One option in this case: if you find a shell of cocaine, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and you meet a bunch of warning signs everywhere, it's just a wonder - how many bans in this state city!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly on prescription (!) from a doctor.
The tourist on arrival will not take the chewing gum, but it is worth sticking the "knife" in the metro, a fine of 1,000 local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white plaques on their necks: "I wasted."
For the abandoned urns smoker in addition to the fine is often judged to "link in the yards": for a week to clean the parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles is paid by a "criminal" who has forgotten to wash the water in the public toilet, and when trying to deal with a small need in the elevator of the residential house works a special detector - the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the very exotic laws - the ban on the feeding of pigeons on the street, the public performance of songs and even the excessive watering of the room plant (!): it is thought that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers should not be allowed to bring lighters into the subway, otherwise a fine of 5,000 Singapore bucks is imposed.
In general, there’s the thought: no matter how hard you try, you’ll definitely break something.
This is not the case at all, - Muhammad Kabir-Kadjaria, the owner of a local travel agency, is trying to ridicule me.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone attracted for their violation.
Why do they survive?
Don’t let the citizens relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly followed.
For example, if a minor is sold cigarettes in a kiosk, everything will be punished according to the chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the offender himself will get hits with sticks on the "back", and the seller will also stand out and be put in jail.
It is precisely because of such strict laws that crimes in Singapore are very rare.
Is that justified?
In the 1970s we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored the lights, drove as they wanted, sat drunk behind the wheel.
After a year of penalties, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having drunk a portion of whiskey, knows: if they stop, the policeman will not let go for the fee, they will impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and for years they will be sent to jail.
For many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems to be a type of concentration camp.
In 1993, U.S. writer William Gibson called Singapore “Disneyland with the Death Penalty” – a visitor from the U.S. that haunted the general wealth of residents, “a terrifyingly clean airport” and “occult nature.”
To say that such things are unnatural, look artificial, and in principle should not be.
The first days in Singapore and rightly you're afraid to throw paper on the sidewalk, you'll be thrilled if you've gone into the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the "Little India" area, and all of a sudden - "break the pattern": at the bus stop, plastic cups are rolled.
"How's that?" you wonder.
That's right, the Singaporeans are smiling.
It's all happening.
Not for every such "crime" caught on the spot, but you should know: if you are calculated, you will not be rejected - because you have violated the law.
Often, this is enough for a person to behave normally.
The government in Singapore is, of course, quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh City, I moved very carefully – motorcyclists often take smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
In the center of Paris is full of dirty beams and requests.
Not everyone on our streets is trying to throw garbage in the urns either.
Singapore, however, has become the quietest, cleanest and safest city on Earth thanks to a set of draconian penalties and ruthless (until the death penalty) laws.
You're thinking.
Such is the human nature: remember, and in Russia no one was stuck behind the wheel until they were penalized.
The main thing in Singapore is not penalties, but voluntary compliance with the law.
And we should think that in Russia people would also be happy with clean streets, the lack of trash in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
There are physical punishments, thank you, no need.
In the rest of Singapore’s laws are at least worth looking at.
Nothing holy?
Now the Trump White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of a regime change is when he begins to fight the statues.
Americans understand this not worse than everyone else – hence the intentional theatrical removal of Saddam Hussein’s statue at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Steven Miller, one of the key ideologists in the Trump administration, was undoubtedly aware of what he was doing when he brought a symbolic torch over the Statue of Liberty during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta over the president’s proposals for a sharp reduction in legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try on the statue itself.
A handful of boat owners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried to do so.
But he attempted her meaning, and especially the meaning that was attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller wrote on Acosta: “I don’t want to go deep in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller put the facts right, but as he himself said, it’s not really about history.
It is about the current sound of the amazing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming to breathe freely, / The unhappy wastes of your abundant shores."
“Unfortunate waste” has never been so visible on our screens.
Miller did not do literature - he made it clear that in America, Trump did not expect these people.
This controversy about the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a controversy about the meaning of America.
Lazarus – and her friends, who struggled to place her words on the shelf of the statue after her death – knew very well that they were doing a perfectly political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connection between the French and American republics by means of a banal classical figure - the female image of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poetry, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: The Mother of the Exiled.
The combination of poetry and image was a brilliant feminist movement and a crushing attack on American natism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right though changed it back.
Rush Limbo, a kind of John the Baptist who announced Trump’s arrival in 2010, argued that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neo-conservative who carries the flame of America to the dark world: “Freedom is coming again.
It bears the flag of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Fackel is not needed to illuminate the path to the United States.”
Contrary to the custom, Limbo really got to the point here.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the point of view.
The great creative accomplishment of Lazarus was to see it as if it were seen by the exhausted, unhappy, but hopeful people on the ship's decks after a long and often heavy sailing.
It literally means looking at the world with the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue responds to them with words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And, of course, that’s not the prospect Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their torches are needed not to illuminate the way, but to energize the hatred, which is the only source of their power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Blake highly appreciates Scottish members of the UK team.
Eileen Doyle recalls a time when there were only two Scots in the UK.
Neil Blake, director of the UK Athletics Federation, said the 16-man Scottish team would make a “significant contribution to the team’s game.”
A record number of Scottish lightweight athletes were selected for the 2017 London Championship starting on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland “something special is born” and the UK Athletics Federation should take this into account.
“We know this and we’re trying to understand it and we’re going to support it as long as they have the potential,” Blake said.
“I talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it’s because of what they did.
The Scottish Light Athletics Federation thinks that with what they have done, you have to work.
The British Federation of Light Athletics: With what they did, you have to work.
People on the street think the same thing.
I don’t know why the circumstances are so, but it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Some of the Scottish lightweight athletes claim medals, including Laura Moore and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 m; and Eileed Doyle the team chose as their captain.
"Elysium is humble.
Her captain's speech was wonderful," Blake said.
"Many lightweight athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, and from where they live or train, have come out of this room, feeling proud and in a mood to win.
The passion and the sincere feelings that Eilid put in her were wonderful.”
The holder of the silver medal of the Commonwealth Championship, which at its fifth World Championships will run a distance of 400 m with obstacles, says that 16 Scots in the British team are "incredible".
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Murray, who specializes in mid-range running, has broken five British and two European records last year.
She runs at 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will participate in the 1500m race, is another Scotsman to pay attention to: behind his back has a successful season, in which there were victories in the selection competitions of the British team and in the annual competitions.
Doyle remembers her first world championship when, apart from her, the only Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots have not only entered the team, but in some cases will claim medals and fight for the final.
“The captain of the team is chosen by other team members, so it was a huge honour anyway, but knowing that your comrades voted for you and you voted for you is a very special thing for me,” she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who have joined the team.
This shows how much we got.
And they are all made light athletes who will strive to get to the pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just noticed that we were very fortunate to receive the World Cup at home.
So it’s just about how important it is to get support from fans and take advantage of the fact that we’ll be at the Olympic Stadium again.
I got another chance to go to his arena and take part in the competitions, and the atmosphere there will be just great.”
Blocking Critics on Facebook: You Don’t Need to Be Proposed to Public Position If You’re Not Ready to Listen to Criticism from Voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
The Americans loved George Washington, but this did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
His criticism, of course, annoyed him.
But he didn’t shut his mouth to his critics.
In 1783, Washington said, “We, the deaf and the dumb, can be taken away as sheep for slaughter.”
Now I'm going to move on to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him.
The governor’s subordinates called the claim void, and the comment on the internet was written in the spirit of “well what”.
“It’s just Facebook,” many will say.
But it's also important.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is an astoundingly popular Republican governor in a democratic predominantly state.
He is second in the approval rating among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a reluctant reactionary.
He has demonstrated a firm hand in the governance of the state and a commitment to its principles.
He also happily uses Facebook as the primary way of communicating with his voters and with jokes demonstrating on his page his laziness after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is declared as an official public forum and is run by administration staff for taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, press secretary Amelia Chess defended the governor’s actions, claiming that blocking comments is simply their moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and hackers who are harassing the internet.
Post spoke to some of the real people that Hogan blocked.
And these are real people, not trolls, -- a teacher, a businessman, a pastor, who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, substantive and not gross.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramana from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
“I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news,” she wrote in the comments section of the post.
“I also don’t like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same topic, some people immediately say it’s a so-called screwdriver, instead of admitting they’re dealing with a large group of dissatisfied citizens.”
What the governor’s subordinates call a “concentrated spam attack,” others would probably call an “active life position.”
In the era of Facebook, it’s easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or clearing negative comments.
It is much less dusty work than before, when it was required to send people, collect and burn newspapers with critical advances, or arrest and shut up protesters.
But that’s exactly what’s happening right now, just in the figure.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, turn-based decisions on the subject was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James C. Casheris, the chairman of the County Supervisory Board of Laudon violated the First Amendment by banning the voter in his Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bavin has filed complaints by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington’s time, the era of affordable postal expenses made roughly the same turnaround as today’s Internet.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers had quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters greatly overthrew his authority.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belizarius" and "Porcius" wrote letters in newspapers that ridiculed Washington's decision.
According to historical documents compiled by the online project “George Washington’s Documents,” his office was shattered by petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Maritime Affairs.
But he didn’t try to keep them silent.
Freedom of speech, dissension and speech is at the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means agreeing with that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home amenities at the Renaissance club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort for the next three days, when the Renaissance club in East Lothian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for senior athletes.
A native of Northern Ireland, who led the neighbourhood at Archerfield Links club, and moved in the direction of the final round last year until he lost to Paul Iles, attached to a new place and performs the role of the tournament's representative on behalf of the founder and director.
“I’ve seen the Renaissance club build, and we’re watching it succeed with this event,” Rafferty said.
“The players will see this field at its best, it’s in great condition.
Jerry did a great job of arranging this place.
He is a fierce supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It’s a great demonstration for this field.”
The Englishman, Iles, is looking forward to the opportunity to defend the championship for the first time, despite the fact that he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour for his 32-year career.
"It's really a special feeling," said the Southport player.
“I couldn’t try to win the Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Going back to this corner of the world is magical.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time, and we will always remember it.”
He returns to the battle in his homeland Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Athletes Tournament after he turned 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“When you play at home, it’s always a little bit more important,” said Helensboro Orr.
“You want to perform well, but you feel this extra burden.”
I was happy to play again, and I showed great golf.
I’m happy with how it’s done so far.”
The trio will be joined by former Masters winner Yang Wusnem and Major champions for senior athletes Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNally.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Steven MacLeister, Bill Longmyer and Ross Drammond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs <0xC2><0xA3>5 per hour if one person is in the car, and <0xC2><0xA3>10 if two or more.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British Roads Will Learn to Absorb Dangerous Emissions
Similar tunnels over highways, capable of absorbing carbon dioxide emitted by cars, are already undergoing testing on UK roads.
The country’s transport agency, according to the publication Autocar, reported the positive results of tests of a 100-metre tunnel installed on one of the roads in the north of the country.
The 6-metre tunnel is built from some of the latest polymeric materials that are able to absorb harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the creation of an entire network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the UK authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to a network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of activities to reduce the car flow on the roads, expand the use of commercial transport on an electric tractor and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is caused by transport, and unsatisfactory air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsud changed the punishment of Mamaev's disability to a fine
Mosgorsud changed the sentence of disabled Anton Mamaev, sentenced to four-and-a-half years of colony, to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor’s office asked the court to replace the term by condition, explaining its request by saying that Mamaev’s disease “impeds him to be in prison.”
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with imprisonment in a colony of the general regime for theft, which was the victim of a former special force fighter.
On July 19, the court released a man from custody at the exit hearing at SIZO.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's "Golden Land"
After lunch, Bardina Degey does not use the plate.
It is even rarely used in pots.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply places a sweet potato, which is called a “note”, right in the foyer.
After half an hour, the cloven crumbs get and eat with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degey sits on the ground floor – she does not have furniture – and this is where she does her homework, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby cove.
The bathroom serves a jar in the room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, so she was not commissioned to work in the field.
The multiplicity is widespread here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are still soldiers.
“No one decides to walk through the village after five in the evening,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was joined to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, publicly raising their hands before the occupying forces.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands has quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which maintains strict control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enaratali is a city as remote as it is abandoned; the road here includes a half-hour flight from Jayapur, the administrative center of the province, in Nabir, and then a five-hour shake on the rental car.
There is no public transport here.
The city with a population of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses covered with bamboo fences; the roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust in a variety of reddish shades.
Few Indonesians have come here, not to mention journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Maya Pago popes worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
“It was unusual for us to wear this clothes,” says Degey, pointing to his bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
“Earlier, we only wore leaves on the body.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, while child mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in Asia.
But it's still Indonesia's gold country.
The world’s largest and most lucrative gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a high-altitude province about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has mined gold and copper there for about <0x24>3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua can boast of forest reserves, which are estimated at <0x24>78 billion.
These fortunes, however, are one inconvenience for the papacy, ensuring that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia retain their breathtaking presence here.
According to an investigation by the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local soldiers and units nearly <0x24>20 million, including up to <0x24>150,000, to one officer.
The demands for greater autonomy on the part of the papacy threaten the existence of this golden vial and are mercilessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 popes have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969, and thousands have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass murders in populated indigenous peoples of the high mountains of Papua in the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We’ll lose everything,” the report, published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without a trial, torture, torture, and torture – particularly common, as claimed in another report, and forceful.
“It’s hard to count the number of casualties because the incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The hawks were delayed as Papua's resources attracted influx of displaced people from other parts of Indonesia.
The province’s population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but the demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from densely populated Indonesian islands – Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese lavenders, "warungas", sell roasted chicken and a mixture of vegetables "gado-gado", served with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to stand up to competition.
“Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables cheaper in the traditional market than indigenous people in Papua,” says Abet Yow, a twenty-four-year-old native of Paniaj, who moved to Jayapur, the province’s administrative center, due to work.
“Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua – the momma (women) of Papua – have lost their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, known in the people as Jokovi, vowed to deal with inequality and rights violations in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter was given the support of 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But in Papua, almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel committed.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for the Jockeys, expecting them to fulfill our hopes of restoring justice,” he said.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration of Jokowi Paniai survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street singing Christmas anthems near the quay in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers were ejected from the dark on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javed Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and returned with four soldiers after a while.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers who were drunk were chasing the children and beating them with guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Amo, was hit so hard that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone burned down a government building near the electoral commission, and the next day the situation worsened.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of a local police station and a military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them the ritual hunting bows and performed the Vietnamese, the dance of the Papal tribe Mei Pago: they ran around and portrayed the bird singing.
Some protesters began to smash stones at the police department and the military base.
When the situation got worse, internal radio soldiers were ordered: "If the crowd is resisting more than three times, shoot them," - so it sounded, as claimed in the official document, which was seen by the correspondents of the magazine "Time", but which was not found in Smugglers.
The fifty-six-year-old Jeremiah Kayame, the head of the district of Kogo Koto in Enarotali, felt the danger approaching and called for calm, appealing to the crowd with a request to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I came back, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist,” he told TIME magazine, standing on the wing of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who shot, but he says the bullet came from the sheriffs of the assembled soldiers.
“There were a lot of people, there were a lot of shots,” he added.
The local resident of Alfius Joab was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran to him and checked his body to make sure it was him,” Johannes told TIME magazine, which, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
“I saw that he was dead...I kissed him.”
General Yotje Mende, the senior inspector of the Papua police, told reporters that his officers were only “defending” their base because it was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us to kill us,” said Pujo Solistio, a Papua police spokesman in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed, and many more were injured.
The news of the murders came to Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a gloomy speech in Jayapur in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historical abuses of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately, so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, security minister Viranto said he would set up a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
Almost immediately there was a response.
“Most of the violations have happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s or at the beginning of zero.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be undertaken,” he said.
Viranto then renounced his words, speaking to Time magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he did not plan to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be decided through the court.”
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999, said that 11 human rights violations in Papua have already been resolved, including the Pa incident.
The families of the victims from Paniai met with such statements with dark distrust.
“For the past three years I have been asked four times, but there has been absolutely no change,” says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later he's still living in fear.
“I’m scared,” he says.
"I'm afraid I'm being arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'm being shot."
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the inhabitants of Paniya were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury the four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in the neighbouring Paniya district of Deiya.
During the clash between the villagers and the construction company manager, who refused to help take the man, who was unconscious, to the hospital, one person was killed and another 17 were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dove, drowned while catching fish in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the office of the construction site owned by the company.
According to police, the villagers were throwing stones at the officers, who responded to the warning shots.
But locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
"We were so panicked, we're afraid of revenge," Dominggu Badia, a twenty-nine-year-old who lives near the hospital, told TIME magazine and saw how quickly the wounded were delivered.
“I’ve been hiding at home for two days.”
Parliament has demanded that officers involved in the incident be called for a response and that a mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Pania has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development is caused by the dissatisfaction of the Mea, Mona, Dana and Damal tribes scattered throughout the territory covered with greenery of the central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), an insurgent army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by conducting sporadic attacks and assaults with kidnapping of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM executives are from Panyay, including Tadius Yoga and Daniel Yehudas Kogoya.
In response in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and groundlessly detained by the military on the pretext of “defending national independence”.
Some of them never came back.
Among the population of Papua-Panai, it is considered “a sad, forgotten place.”
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is not available to the same extent.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly notes, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the crop for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten club notes cost just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between indigenous Papuas and new migrants, who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights at Nabir airport, increased.
Few existing vacancies are usually available to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papayas rarely have enough money or skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village... because there’s no work or money here,” said John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps Papua from the viewpoint of the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of the international media remain rigid.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Esquiude and Basil Longshan were deported from Papua for "insufficient consistency with the relevant organizations" despite being granted rare permits to shoot videos.
According to Felim Kine, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the Jokowi campaign to lift restrictions on media work in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Now foreign journalists trying to report from rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, are facing new dangers: visa waivers and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
Lack of attention from the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited by the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – appealed to the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “different and widespread violations” in Papua, including the shooting.
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arramanata Nasir, resigned from the group’s statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that “in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is a free press, so it was necessary to hide the evidence of human rights violations.”
The locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Dutch human rights ambassador Keis Van Baar, visited Jayapur on May 4, locals broke the silence, please: “We want freedom,” as a source who also attended the meeting said.
Indonesia will hold a new presidential election in 2019, but the papacy says it is unlikely to vote for the Jokovi again.
“Jhokovi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Paniai,” said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadow of the threats from the greedy army, are drowned in poverty, and their education and health care are in a miserable state.
Gobai says that the inhabitants of Paniai, like other papayas, consider their vote for Jokovi a debt that he has to pay.
“They don’t want money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Pania carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: buried the body of one of the victims on the ground just opposite the police and military site.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not allow the culprits to forget their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” says Jacobbus, not lifting his head.
“What else did we have to do?”
The fire for the second time covers Dubai skyscraper "Fakel"
The fire engulfed one of the world’s tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to quickly leave the 70-story building at a height of 337 meters.
This is already the second fire that occurred in the high-rise building – which by chance is called “Fakel” – in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no immediate news of the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor,” a skyscraper named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai City Civil Defense Administration, firefighters extinguished the fire at around 4:00 local time (00:00 Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing asylum to the victims.
The incident could bring back the safety issues of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
During an investigation by the Fakel administration after the fire there in 2015 it was found that the most affected were the coating – the external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed the insulation system and the panels of the Greenfell Tower building in London could accelerate the spread of the June fire that killed some 80 people.
The growth of tourist flow in Ida-Virumaa in June turned out to be minimal
According to the data received by the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, the services of Northeastern hotel companies benefited from a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, which is 125 people or more per year.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has decreased, and foreign tourists have increased.
Thus, foreign tourists increased by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists in June.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525 people.
The most noticeable increase in the number of Russian tourists in the region - by 8.9% or by 318 people compared to June 2016.
In total, in June 2017, 3885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed in the hotels of Ida-Virumaa.
Andrei Malakhov made clear to fans who are responsible for his care
Andrei Malakhov hinted at his fans on Instagram, who are guilty of his departure from the "First" channel.
So far, he has not commented on rumors, but today posted a fragment of the article in the newspaper "Vedomosti" for August 1.
Photo Malakhov signed the tag "boss molokos".
Article on how to prevent the "burning" of an employee and pay attention to his condition.
If you remember the numerous messages that the leader was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who began to reformat "Let's Talk", it becomes clear what he so transparently hinted at, writes "CP".
As reported, television presenter Andrei Malakhov is currently on leave and has not signed an application for dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation with the dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
Five soldiers were killed in a car blast in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Gilman, RIA Novosti reports.
According to police, on the eve of the evening, near the military blockpost at the exit of Girishk, a mined car exploded.
We know about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new CP took place in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The fighting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Dyver shot a video of his shark's camera
Dyver and researcher Greg Skomal captured a video of a shark that hit his GoPro action camera.
The role was posted on Facebook by the U.S. Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, whose employee is Scomal.
The incident took place on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod peninsula in the northeastern United States, according to the NECN portal.
The man attempted to take the shark off the camera, which he held on a special stick.
Seeing the man, an animal of more than three meters in length floated to him.
The shark began to bite the camera, and did not attempt to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator acted in a similar way to determine whether the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such behavior of the sea animal turned out to be novelty for scientists.
The cause of the mass fighting in the Ural military center has become known
A working group of senior military officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Elan Training Center, where the mass fighting took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this massacre have already been made known.
According to the Mash public, who appeared on the page "VKontakte", the contractors of the Ural military part number 31612 have been severely damaged due to an untreated bed.
It all started with the fact that a ranksman named Sayan had been demonstrably ignoring the officer’s order to fill the stove.
On the side of the officer stood soldiers from the sixth company.
Cynthia supported the first group.
Within half an hour, 140 young boys were crushed in the barracks of beds and sinks, cut off glass.
More than 10 people were injured in the mass battle.
The CSO denied information about the pig.
The study found that at least one-fifth of passengers in the U.S. carry prohibited items on board.
The study found that more than 20 per cent of air passengers consciously or accidentally carried prohibited items in luggage on board the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 per cent on board, in spite of carrying prohibited knives or other items.
Almost 1 percent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study by the charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., covering more than 1,000 people, also found that young passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who acknowledged that they deliberately tried to fly with something banned from the ATP, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
The ATB employees consciously pass through most of the food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they had specifically examined sharp objects, and 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents acknowledged that they had deliberately carried illegal drugs on board.
The company said it had studied passengers across the country to find out how many of them accidentally smuggled through inspections at airports, and how many did it consciously.
It is quite expected that most of the time – consciously or unconsciously – smuggling through the examination of those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the ATP rules are quite complex and confusing.
People often don’t know exactly what fluids they can carry and in what amount.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of what ATB selects are forbidden liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could be considered prohibited to carry a book.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
EPA chief Pruitt renounces intent to postpone implementation of Obama’s emission reduction rules
The next day after the 15-state lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency canceled his decision to postpone the implementation of Obama’s rules aimed at reducing emissions of pollutants and smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by saying that his agency now more than in previous administrations is listening to the needs of environmental regulators in individual states.
He did not mention the lawsuit against his previous position filed in the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute started around the 1st of October, to which the states should ensure compliance with the 2015 Ozone Standards at the ground level.
In June, Priuitt announced that it would postpone their compliance by one year to give its agency more time to study the plan and avoid “incompatibility with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth.”
Prior to being appointed by President Trump to his current post, Pruett, who was the attorney general of Oklahoma, has long been known as a consistent opponent of the tightening of environmental standards.
After moving to Washington, Princeton repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of norms opposed by the chemical or gas-oil industry.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Piyette in return to previous norms.
Last month, a federal court of appeal in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA had exceeded his powers in an attempt to delay the Obama administration's implementation of the rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed to consider that, by sharply changing the course of ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the EPA's duty to cooperate with states in the comprehensive process of timely implementation of the new standards.
“At previous administrations, the EPA was often unable to settle within the deadlines set, after which it waited for claims from activist groups and others and discussed deadlines during the settlement of the case,” said Priuitt, who filed more than a dozen claims against the EPA in his previous post.
“We don’t believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take our statutes seriously and the power it gives us.”
However, the EPA’s statement said that Priuitt could at some point re-use its “authorities for delay and other data by law power” to ensure that the norms “jcyjdfys on the clear course and on all available information.”
Republicans in Congress are insisting on a broader review of the rules on ozone.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, aims to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
“The change of course of the EPA after our claims is an important victory in the health and safety struggle of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly influenced by the smog that covers their cities,” Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia joined the claim.
Ozone at the ground level occurs when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, oil and chemical refineries and other sources enter the atmosphere in reaction to sunlight.
This can cause serious breathing problems in people who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health and environmental advocates welcomed the unexpected change in the course of the Priyutt.
“It’s sad to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this perfectly logical step from the person entrusted with protecting the air we breathe,” said Laurie Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the Trump administration’s ideological campaign to protect those who pollute the air and their special interests.”
Congress of the IAAF extended the abolition of the All-Russian Federation of light athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) voted in favour of extending the abolition of the All-Russian Federation of Athletics (VFLA).
The congress thus supported the IAAF Council for the Restoration of the FFLA, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the removal be kept in effect.
166 people voted for the extension of the removal, against 21, TASS reports.
The report of the IAAF Board said that the FFLA had made significant progress towards achieving the conditions set by the Board for the Restoration of Membership, but these conditions were not yet fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the VFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian athletes were forced to act under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people who were admitted to the IAAF championship.
The FFLA was indefinitely disqualified by the IAAF in 2015.
The report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was then published, which spoke about numerous violations of the WADA regulation committed by Russian officials and athletes.
For more information on the latest report of the IAAF Council, see the "I" material "IAAF has extended sanctions against the FLAF".
Offensive defeat
As part of the 3 rounds of the Russian Fonbet Championship among the teams of the PFL, NovoMoscow "Kimik" held a departure match against FC "Kaluga".
Just over 10 days ago, the rivals played each other in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"The chemist" did not give in to the opponent in any way, but the second relaxation at the end of the match led to an outrageous goal and fiasco.
After a recent defeat from the caliphate with a 0:3 score, many have predicted a slight victory of the masters.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the Novo-Moscow people were forced to consider themselves and acted from the defense, but from a position of force.
In the 1st time, the caliphs made more and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was played by Alexei Sirotin, who repeatedly reflected the dangerous strikes and gave confidence to the partners with his actions.
Unfortunately, in the Chemistry attack, there was not enough effort and luck to put the defense of the Kaluga to a stop and score the first goal at the exit.
After the break the game began to take place in the meeting courses.
The Novomoskians played more actively in the attack.
The alarming bells for our team were the errors in the defense, which allowed the caliphs to create a number of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, the chemist seized the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the caliphate played its role - they were more proficient and cold-blooded, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, the chemist transferred the ball to the corner, the pitch of which the owner of the field without resistance was transferred to the gate.
The author of the goal was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the report meeting, "The Chemist" demonstrated a good game, but suffered an outrageous defeat.
In front of our team is another departure - on August 11 at 19 hours in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named Eduard Streltsov, the Novomoskians will fight with the favorite group "Center" of FC "Ararat", which is composed of Roman Pavlyuchenko, Igorov, Izmayov.
Come and support the chemist!
The place and time of the meeting of the New Moscow people - 18 h. 30 min. near the shop "Magnolia" (East, d.2, Korp.
Composition "Chemical": Sirotin, Manohin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Homotov, Gogiya (Oreshkin), Dudaiti, Ryzhov, Svatov, Belyanin (Adoevtsev), Andrejchenko (Lygin)
Press service of the "Kimik" club
According to published decryption of phone calls, Trump pressed Mexico about paying the wall at the border.
The Washington Post published decryptions of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nyeta, Trump insisted that he stop publicly stating that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The U.S. president lamented him for publicly speaking against the wall, and, according to the information, said, “You can’t say this to the press.”
Trump began his election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and vowed to force Mexico to pay for the project.
In the published decryption of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a hot overbook was also found.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States should accept refugees heading to Australia was "dirty", "abhorrent" and "stupid", and insisted that because of the deal, the Obama administration's verdict would overwhelm him, he would look like he was.
Trump concluded the conversation by telling Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation of the day.”
The bodies of tourists killed in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane, owned by the airline "Russia", on board which are the bodies of the dead Russian women in Abkhazia, flew off at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, TASS reports.
At the final point of follow-up, the staff of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the mayor of the city, told reporters the deputy minister of resorts and tourism of Abkhazia, Astamir Ahba.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic said that all the costs associated with the delivery of the bodies back to Russia were borne by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay the families of the deceased compensation in the amount of 500,000 rubles.
According to Ahba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed a willingness to pay the relatives of those who died as a result of the explosions of tourists flights and residence in the republic, but relatives sent to the republic only confidence in the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, in the village of Primorskiy Gudautsky district in the warehouse of missile and artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic, two explosions broke out, after which began detonating large-caliber missiles and other bombs stored there.
As a result, there was a fire in the warehouse, which provoked uncontrolled explosions of ammunition of various modifications.
As a result, two citizens of Russia were killed - Elena Polyakova of the 1970 birth and Elena Timofeev of the 1962 birth, who were on vacation near the serum hydrogen source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying degrees of severity were taken to the medical institutions of the republic.
Currently, seven people remain in the station, the rest have been discharged.
Study of the Russian influence on the U.S. election will be carried out by a large jury
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller convened a large jury in Washington, D.C., which will investigate Russia’s influence on the 2016 US presidential election, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to seek witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to present charges.
The summoning of a grand jury gives Mueller additional authority to collect testimony.
One of the themes of the jury’s investigation, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son of then presidential candidate Donald Trump with Russian lawyer Natalie Veselnitska.
To check the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, Mueller himself had previously promised.
They've already been investigated by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded his lawyers.
Trump Jr. previously said he had been waiting for a compromise to be reached at the headquarters of the candidate from the Hillary Clinton Department, but no revealing documents were presented, and the discussion was ultimately about adoption.
In early August, a number of media reported that Trump Jr.’s statement about a meeting with Veselnick was literally dictated by Trump the Elder.
The White House clarified that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, as any father would do.
Deputy Mayor of Penza Detained at Work
The deputy head of the Penza administration, Irina Shirshina, was detained for 48 hours on the orders of the Investigative Committee at her workplace, RIA Novosti reports.
Official statements from law enforcement agencies have not yet been received on this matter, but the press service of the SC said that they will be followed soon.
There is no comment on what has happened in Penza's town hall.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has curated urban affairs and land relations, taking this position since April 2015.
Prior to that, she had long served as head of the Department of State Inspection for the Penn Region.
Irina Shirshina raises three minor children, it is noteworthy that once again she became a mother a year ago, she gave up her decree holiday and returned to work.
Of course, there are no cosmodromes or rocket carriers in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bust is a tribute to the first person who visited space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are taken away in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin, on the contrary, "shut around the planet".
In 2012, the monument was erected in Houston, U.S., near NASA’s former headquarters.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was erected in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a Gagarin monument in Germany in the city of Erfurt, where our astronaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) avoided sneezing in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin in Riga appeared a monument to Yurius Gagarins.
This is how the name and surname of the first astronaut sounds in Latvian, and he looks like he was 70 years old.
Murder at Morse Ford: activists lose Lynch's courts on stage to appeal for justice
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed the viewers in the village of Monroe, Georgia, and with a glimpse of the small Morse Ford Bridge.
When the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her way.
The main man, a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin strip, stretched out with a cigarette and looked through the windshield.
The insides trembled with fear.
“We need this nigger, Roger!” the man shouted.
“Get him out of the car!”
The pervasive cries broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this awful scene, which was played on July 22, is just a stage.
But when Roger's neck was slammed into the loop, almost all the viewers were really breathing.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to lose again the night when the Puppet Clowns lynched two black couples in 1946 - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's awful that no one has been arrested in all these years - although we see them next to us; although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the film.
“It’s a stain on our history and a stone on our souls.”
71-year-old Brooks is a former Georgian Congressman who has been fighting for human rights his entire life.
For him, the show is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been rectified.
“We want investigations, we want conclusions, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he said.
“We can’t go to healing and reconciliation until we get justice.”
The coroner covers the body of one of the victims of the lynching at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI material obtained by the NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of participating in the linkage.
But no one has ever been charged.
While the suspects have been on the loose for decades, human rights defenders say the city has always been well aware of the two related motives of the lynchers: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court’s decision allowed black citizens to vote for the first time in the summer.
Approximately during the same election, according to the FBI, black user Roger Malcolm hit in a fight with a knife Barnett Hester, a white landowner - apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that, according to rumors circulating in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she was supposed to give birth was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid <0x24>600 in bail to free Malcolm from prison.
He went to jail with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they were driving out of prison and approaching the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of lynchings surrounded the car.
“It appears that he organized and commanded Harrison’s murders,” the FBI said in a statement.
"It is also obvious that there was a controversy between the law enforcement agencies of the state and the city, which not only took part in the murders, but also destroyed the evidence and hid the identities of witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attack on voting rights," he said.
“They were all killed to send a signal to black people in the city: if you register and vote, the same thing will happen to you.”
For nearly a decade Cassandra Green has been leading an annual performance, reproducing the lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is overlooked, it captures the viewer and tells of the deep racism that, as many would like to consider, there is no more in America.
It’s hard to watch and even harder to turn around, but Green thinks that’s the main thing.
“We don’t want to talk about Lynch’s trials because they show us our own ugliness,” she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear what I've experienced."
The rehearsals of this year’s performance began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors – a dozen whites, the rest blacks – gathered in the room and listened to a review of the play.
Wade Marbo was the director with Green.
He has played the lead member of the clan for several years, but says the role has never been easier.
“I think I’m screwed up because it’s not the person I am,” Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back to that time."
In the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascone, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The spectrum begins with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Ruskin screams in response.
It's a blow.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are excited.
Green laughs louder than anyone else.
"What is it?" asked Ascona.
He's worried and confused.
Am I overplaying?
"No," said Greene with laughter.
"I just don't think the whites said 'nigga' at the time."
“Yeah,” one of the black artists laughed.
"You have to wear a hard 'R'."
And the energy in the room is changing: discomfort is changed by a sense of companionship.
Everyone should do everything right, not only for the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts first.
This time, when Rascona says the word for the letter "n", it becomes clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Screaming, shooting, and then silence.
The woman in sad black clothes stands above the actors’ bodies and performs Billy Holly’s sad song “Strange Fruit”.
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
In a hundred yards of it, half a hundred viewers wipe tears and sweat from their eyes.
There are almost equal numbers of blacks and whites among the audience.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York, to watch the show; many live nearby.
They all endured the heavy spirit of Georgia for almost eight hours, while Brooks led them to pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until then, the murders were nothing but history, but now that they are standing in the same place where people were lynching, it seems that their ghosts are floating right in the air.
When the last note of the song is silent, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
The children bend to their heads, touch the paint depicting blood, and still bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy whispered, as if to remind himself of it.
After a few minutes, Green thanked the audience, and all of a sudden it was over.
The actors throw the ropes off the neck and wipe away the tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbo, the man in a costume who played the main puppet clown.
Nick Raskona embraces two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional burden of the show finally collapsed on him.
"It's all right," whispered one of the women.
“We know that your heart is good.
You had reasons for that.”
Later, the audience sat down to dine with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta discusses a show with a black couple they have just met.
Deniza Daplinski struggles to find words to describe what she feels after the performance.
“It’s hard to listen to these horrible, gruesome words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you,” she says.
“After that, I think the lynchings are still happening,” she adds, “it’s only now that it’s called that the police are shooting.”
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, received a lot of attention.
He says he has already started planning for next year’s performance.
“The setup encourages us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us,” he says.
“Because if you don’t learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who don’t study their history, who don’t know their history, are condemned to repeat it.”
The court fined Navalny for violations on "activist journal"
The Simonov court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny by 300,000 rubles for violating the order of the rally.
The opposition was found guilty of the administrative offence provided for in Article 8 20.2 of the Russian Coalition for Repeated Violation of the Organization of the Meeting.
Earlier, the judge of the Simonov Court of Moscow, Hizhir Mussakayev, finished examining the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the opposition’s headquarters, Alexey Navalny, who was charged with the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 rubles.
In such an amount, Judge Mussakayev assessed the distribution of leaflets on the "activity journal", which Navalny's supporters held in Moscow on July 8-9.
After seeing the agit material, who monitored the participants of the Saturday, the police felt that the organizers of the event deliberately hid its true essence - the public action (for which it is necessary to request permission from the capital authorities in advance).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers, Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev, applied for the cessation of administrative proceedings in connection with the lack of composition of the offence and indicated that the police had made certain mistakes in drafting the protocol.
On the very "activist sabotage" Volkov was not detained, but he received an agenda obliged him to appear in the police department to tell about the event held with his active participation.
The same agenda was received by Navalny himself and another fellow of the opposition - Nikolai Lyaskin.
Murdoch arrested for shooting the bride and three wedding guests
A court in Mordovia arrested a local resident who shot four people at the wedding, including a bride.
This was reported in the Republican Administration of the Investigative Committee.
The incident took place on the evening of 29 July.
During the fight, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk shot several times at the guests of the event, who came to the country basin to bathe.
As a result, three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been initiated under paragraph "a" part 1 of article 213 of the U.K. of the Russian Federation ("Hulyganstvo"), part 3 of article 30 and paragraphs "a", "e", "and" part 2 of article 105 of the Russian Federation ("Intervention for the murder of two or more persons perpetrated in a common dangerous manner") of the Hooligans.
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire because the guests of the wedding, having decided to bathe, passed through the territory of his plot to the water.
Minenergo will tighten requirements to turbine suppliers for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for providing information to suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power plants.
With the launch of gas turbines, gas turbines, oil transfer facilities and oil mining equipment suppliers will be obliged to share access data with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The draft Government’s decree is already ready and has been submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will touch only “critically important energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
The document identifies potential threats such as information and access to the facility management by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, disloyal partners and hackers.
EU extends anti-Russian sanctions for Siemens
On August 4, the European Union Press Service said anti-Russian sanctions had been extended due to a scandal surrounding supply of Siemens turbines to Crimea.
This was previously reported by the Arguments of the Week.
The EU Council’s press service said that sanctions against Russia were extended due to a scandal with Siemens turbines, which were allegedly delivered to Crimea to circumvent sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is examining all possible complaints and proposals by member states to extend anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was reported that the final decision will be taken by the end of the current day, and here the decision has been made, sanctions against Russia have been extended.
Pierson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, British education group Pirson announced that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 per cent in connection with the start of a new business restructuring program aimed at tackling the problems of their businesses.
These job cuts, which, according to CEO John Fallon, will mainly take place at the end of 2018 and early 2019, occur in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut during the previous restructuring.
Pierson said it plans to cut spending by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million (<0x24>394 million) in May during its third cost-cutting program to try to revive a business that was hit by a rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its share in the publishing house Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 2 percent increase in sales of the main product in the first half of the year.
Kabul Convoy Attack: NATO Soldier Killed in Death Explosion
According to official sources, the deadly terrorist attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
Five soldiers and a translator were injured, according to a NATO report.
According to unchecked data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the urban area of Karabakh.
The blast is the last of the bloodshed in Afghanistan this month: more than 30 people were killed Tuesday as a result of an explosion in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion, which took place on Thursday evening, occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with the help of a "portable man of a self-made explosive device".
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital near Bagram Airport.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the “Islamic State” (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces located near Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan, and about 20% of them were in the capital.
At the end of July, a deadly car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out the attack.
More than 150 people were killed in a powerful blast in the city center on May 31, the country’s most serious human casualties since U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence is highlighting the unreliable situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is assessing whether it is necessary to increase the number of U.S. military forces providing assistance to the country’s troops and police.
The terrorist attacks in Kabul over the past few weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its conduct, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghana.
The Environmental Protection Agency cancels the decision to postpone the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has revoked its decision to postpone the Obama-era law that states should limit air pollutant emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called "ozone measurements - 2015", stressing that this step shows the agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and responsiveness to them,” said Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
In June, Priuitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency’s intention to postpone the measurements of ozone, in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country, to determine where it needs to be cut, so that it meets the stricter standards of 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, along with the Federal District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit claiming that this intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to reverse a wide range of environmental-protection resolutions introduced by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader program aimed, Trump said, at brighter economic growth.
But actions in this direction have provoked resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on the health of the population.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s website says that the use of ozone-containing air to breathe “can deteriorate the function of the lungs and increase respiratory symptoms,” for example, asthma.
European Business Association opposes new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association has expressed disagreement with US economic sanctions against Russia.
According to AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
AEB said business is one of the important linkages between countries and people, so the principles of free trade should not be restricted.
The European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new line of behavior that would separate business from policy and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and agreement.
Deputies ask police to restrict traffic on the coast in Pskov
The Pskov people’s electorate sent an appeal to the head of the IMF in the city of Sergei Surin about the problem of movement along the banks of the Velika river.
Deputies of the proud Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Storonenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists are preventing people from walking and resting in this place.
In their opinion, controlling the drivers will help make this area more peaceful and safer.
The problem is that the offenders ignore the signs of the “walking trail” and ride freely along the shoreline.
It turns out that major repairs and repairs have been carried out.
Sports and children's playgrounds become uncomfortable because of cars.
As noted by the Pskov Information Agency, in the evenings, the central waterfront is patrolled by the staff of the PPS motor patrol and the wife-in-law.
Thanks to them, the number of passenger cars becomes less, but the entire traffic does not stop.
Putin Calls Investigative Authorities Not to Remove Hard Drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed that investigators should not remove servers and hard drives from working computers in enterprises.
This was stated by the Head of State at the meeting on the investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary to “exclude the application of measures in the interest of investigating the suspension of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from computers and servers.”
Putin noted that if the investigators have such a need, “it is enough to take copies, verify them and use them during the investigation.”
The head of state added that "there is no way to create conditions that hinder the continuation of the business until it is impossible to pay taxes".
Olga Buzova told how much she wanted to call her ex-husband
TV host Olga Buzov admitted that she very much wanted to call her ex-husband - footballer Dmitry Tarasov.
Currently, the celebrity is located in the United States, where it deals with working issues.
Literally the eve of Olga’s visit to Las Vegas, after which she decided to publish a post on Instagram.
She said she did not marry, did not make new tattoos, nor did she call her ex-husband with the words that he ruined her life, although she very much wanted to do so.
Buzova said she will remember this trip forever, as she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy has died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the Minister of Magic Cornelius Fadge in the filming of a series of novels about Harry Potter, died at the age of 92.
This was reported on Thursday by the Independent newspaper.
The actor’s death was reported by his relatives.
According to them, he lived "a huge life, having achieved success in film, theater and television over 70 years of career."
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played with Lawrence Olivier in "The Tragedy of Coriolane".
Hardy also recalled repeatedly performing the roles of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of the screenplays of Agatha Christie's works on Miss Marple.
For the role of Churchill in the BBC television drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award.
Robert Hardy has also had to play the role of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
There was something going on in the Danish state: Prince Henry, and in fact Henri-Marie Jean-Andre, Count de Laborde, refused to be buried with his vengeful wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year's four is a "golden" wedding, but on the couple's agenda - not preparation for celebrations, but a blurred dispute.
His Highness gave up the title of the Prince of Consorts, while he wounded the Queen, which never complained of the title of the Queen of Consorts.
Henry lives in France, although he remains the Queen's official wife.
Russia’s Foreign Ministry Calls on Washington to Stop Sheltering Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry responded to the statements of Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was circulated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs some time ago.
In his comment, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using the Cold War stamps that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the U.S. authorities to stop shelling the Russian Federation.
As the Arguments of the Week wrote earlier, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Western Balkans and organizing a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, talk about the possibility of a decisive match
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seem to be moving tirelessly to hold the most exciting boxing match up to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of the ESPN channel in Los Angeles, until Garcia, an invincible World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked through the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the world champion of boxing.
After Garcia’s unanimous victory over former world champion Erian Bronner in four weight categories on Saturday on the Showtime channel, both boxers are ranked in the top five of the boxers regardless of weight categories.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, “How’s it going, Champion?
Good luck to you.”
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, manager Lomachenko Agis Klimas noted that the potential decisive battle between them would be at the same time.
“I used to be half-heavy,” Garcia recalled.
“I’ve gotten into the category for Bronner [up to 140 pounds], but I’m not that big.
I'm a little 140.
I want to get down to the halfway point.
And he needs to go up to half light [up to 135 pounds], and then we'll arrange a match.
This is what fans want.
Let's fix it for them."
Lomachenko agreed.
“Box needs this fight.”
Climas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of the strategy he adheres to, that Lomachenko spends his debut fight in weight 135 later this year, to designate the next summer is a one-on-one meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 nocauts), which is also a one-on-one.
“The fight can be on the PPV because all the fans have asked for it,” Garcia said, expressing his willingness to fight on the channel that will offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other names will be of such interest.
As soon as they are ready...”
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko to be a “great boxer” and may be visiting his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko did not immediately begin to praise Garcia and said that, in his opinion, the three-weight champion from Riverside looks "very slow, sorry, Mikey... you asked for a knockout."
Garcia said he focused on showing the force of the blow, and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension was rising in front of their own struggle.
“This fight has to take place.
No other battle has caused so much interest and conversation.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I was waiting for some of the top boxers, and there he is, Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
On several central streets of Moscow will shut down the traffic on weekends
On this weekend, 5 and 6 August, the movement will be limited in the capital on the section of Tverskaya Street from Nasta<0xC5><0xA1>insky street to Triumph Square, as well as the movement on 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street.
In addition, the trip will be closed on Leningrad Avenue, from the Third Transport Ring to 1st Tverskaya-Yam Street.
In all areas, the overlapping will operate on both tracks, reports the information center of the Moscow Department of Transportation.
The streets will be closed from midnight on August 5 to 5 a.m. on August 7 due to their renovation.
Also on the weekend, traffic will be closed on the Moscow Riviera area.
There is the construction of the park "Zaritye".
Putin commissioned the Prosecutor General’s Office to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office to carry out an inspection of the territory of Baikal on the subject of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
“I ask the Prosecutor General to check the Bikalystok territory for the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities,” Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on environmental development issues in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader has asked to take action if the facts of the violations are revealed.
New test results to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden have been published
The latest results of asylum seekers’ tests in Sweden, which were subjected to a new age-evaluation method, show that more than 80 percent of the respondents were assessed as individuals over the age of 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make an estimate of the age in the process of granting asylum more accurate, after the Swedish Migrationsverket (Migrationsverket) criticized it for failing to determine the actual age of some refugees who claimed to be imperfect.
Currently, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensic agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of those tested were assessed as individuals 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases the forensic agency estimated that the test was “probably a person 18 years of age or older.”
In the case of 432 cases, the finding stated that the person was "probably less than 18".
Tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is doubtful.
According to Johann Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results correspond to the results of the past months.
“We’re not seeing a big difference with the statistics over the past few months, the numbers are quite relevant,” he told The Local.
The high percentage of cases in which people were estimated to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, “the most likely age to be tested is 18 years or older.”
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper "Svenska Dagbladet" found that in 243 cases, the person openly stated that 18 were executed this year.
The method of medical age assessment, consisting of making wisdom teeth x-rays and tomography of the knee joints and giving them for analysis to dentists and radiologists, has also been critical in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Caroline Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they passed through sexual maturation sooner or later than usual.
“I had reasons to think about it, and I don’t think I need to use the measurement methods that are being used right now.
Biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we can’t define it with certainty, we shouldn’t pretend we can,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransen of the forensic agency said in favour of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it is possible to say that the risk of miscarriage of a child for an adult is wrong.
“The biggest risk we face is when a person is soon 18, in which case he is about 10 percent.”
I'm wondering if I'm going to run for president.
During a business trip to Buryat, Vladimir Putin said he was willing to think about whether to qualify for the post of President of Russia in the 2018 election, reports Interfax.
This statement was a response to the request of the residents of the village of Cheremushka Buryatskaya region.
During the videoconferencing on the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: “Vladimir Vladimirovich, we ask you: when the next presidential elections are held, we ask all of you to vote again.”
“Okay, I’ll think about it, thank you,” the president replied.
On July 28, Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that the pre-election headquarters of Vladimir Putin will be headed by the head of the administration of Russian President Anton Wayno.
Sandkov called these assumptions “nothing based on hypothetical reasoning.”
"So far there are no headquarters, until the establishment of the headquarters is far, until the election campaign is far," Peskov said.
"Until this is not on the agenda," Peskov said.
Governor of West Virginia says he is moving to another party
West Virginia Governor Jim Justis, a Democratic Party spokesman, announced on Thursday during a rally with President Trump that he was moving to another party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats are far from me,” said Governor Justis.
“Today I tell you with many prayers and many reflections ... today I tell you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be useful to you as a Democrat governor.”
The meeting exploded with applause.
“So tomorrow I will change my registration to a Republican,” Justis added.
“As a coach, I would tell you that it’s time to play differently.”
Earlier, Trump had promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with a 42 percent overweight, and Justis did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justis, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at <0x24>1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican Party’s National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening that “Governor Justis’ transition to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is hindering rather than working to make our country great again.”
“Considering only 15 governors and control over the smallest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justis’s statement is just another refusal from the party that has no leaders from the top to the bottom and is unable to find a positive, unifying C-common statement.”
Cat Heavyweight on call Mr. Krasavchik found a home thanks to social networks
Pittsboro (North Carolina, U.S.A.) cat named Mr. Krasavchik weighed more than 14 kilograms after he became famous for the internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
In late June, a photo of the cat was posted on Facebook in the pet's account with a request to find its owner, because "obviously someone had fed it before".
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal's face can become a new meme.
The publication received more than 3.2 thousand likes and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to welcome Mr. Krasavtsich.
As a result, he was given into the hands of Angela Frazee, who promised to take on his excess weight.
In an interview with WNCN radio, the American woman said she had already had a similar experience: she took a cat home weighing about 10 kilograms, and now it weighs a little more than five kilograms.
In July, Reddit users paid attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long legs.

Kou praised Russia’s “more sincere” apology for the doping scandal
International athletic expert Sebastian Kow on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia in connection with the doping scandal, but repeated that now is not the right time to allow the country to participate again.
Russian representative of the federation of light athletics Dmitry Shlakhtin said at the congress of the International Association of light athletic federations, which took place on the eve of the world championship of light athletics, that the removal of his country from the sporting competitions was difficult.
He apologized to “all athletes who had stolen gold and silver medals at the competitions.”
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations voted in favour of maintaining the removal imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the evidence found by the state on the use of funds.
"It seemed to me that today's response, today's report was very sincere," Cow, president of the International Association of Athletic Federations, told reporters.
“All the council and all the congress liked ... that the Russian Federation itself acknowledged that it had experienced extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation.”
Kou said he also “liked” that Russia agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that it is not the time to restore Russia to rights,” he said.
“In the next few months, we have to do everything we can to fix this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate pure athletes from the locked system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations, will take part in the World Light Athletics Championship, which will begin in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletic Federations, said on Monday that a number of requirements are still to be met for the restoration of Russia.
As he told reporters in London after a report made at the Council of the International Association of Athletic Federations, the drug testing is not yet done in sufficient volume, and the removed trainers are still calmly doing their work.
Court Arrested Ukrainian Journalist Suspected in State Change
The detainee by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) journalist Vasily Muravitskiy has been detained for two months, the SBU reports.
An official of the Internet publication "Journal Zhitomira" is suspected of state treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and attacking the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a “barbaric policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship "Commander Borsini" entered Libyan territorial waters to then, together with the country's Navy, stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to start the operation was taken by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome has agreed to it with the internationally recognized Libyan government, which, however, does not control much of the country's territory.
The opposing cabinet and the Tobruk-based Libyan parliament accused Italy of violating Libya’s sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army Field Marshal Haftar ordered his subordinates to counter Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they said they did not believe these threats and intended to send another warship to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in talks by Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the Europe-recognized Libyan cabinet Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities have set up a naval mission to combat illegal migration, after statistics on the number of illegals stranded in the country from Libya were released in July: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The government said that the migrant reception resources were exhausted.
A large-scale crash occurred in Skype.
A global failure in the operation of Skype service was spotted today in several countries around the world.
Users on Thursday, August 3, began sending mass complaints to the developers of the program.
Microsoft stressed that specialists are already actively working on solving the problems that the residents of Europe and North America have faced, RIA Novosti said.
It should be noted that in June of this year, there was also a failure in Skype.
For some time, users were unable to receive and send messages.
Two leaders of Ukraine's athletics team removed from participation in the World Cup
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povch, who specialize in short distance running, are excluded from the Ukrainian team at the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Light Athletics of the country (FLAU).
The decision was made by the executive of the organization in connection with the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) in the field of disciplinary procedures for athletics.
Trainer Zemlyak Sergey Basenko is also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects the athlete of using doping.
Powch is a bronze medalist at the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championships, the 2010 European Champion at the stage of 4 to 100 metres, Zemljak is the winner of the 2012 European Championship at the stage of 4 to 400 metres.
The World Athletics Championships in London will take place from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted spending by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar’s world record transfer from Spain’s Barcelona to France’s Paris Saint-Germain.
Any consequences can come further along the chain, for Paris Saint-Germain by UEFA, the governing body that controls European football, whose authorities prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
From the rules of the financial fair-play introduced by UEFA in 2011, it is clear that the PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar’s transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million (<0x24>262 million) just to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a lawsuit that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
The PSG could definitely luxuriate to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, considering the funding of the team from the energy-rich ruling Qatari family.
Clubs have the right to spend large amounts on acquiring players, but they have to balance them for legitimate sources of income in order to reach the profitability threshold in their football business.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs falling into huge debts in their pursuit of success were essentially robbing and risking ruin in the event that banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on club debts and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model that was originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential, and then seriously spend to improve the team and create a global brand – became a difficult plan.
During the current three-year evaluation period, which spans 2018, clubs can bear losses of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And, despite Platini being shamelessly removed from his presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to restrain excessive spending.
"Of course, FFP is alive, and we will, moving forward, tighten the rules," Andrea Traverso, who controls FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG will pay the redemption of Neymar’s contract at the same time, he can allocate this amount for accountability for the entire duration of his contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer cost can be shown in the annual report as a cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the most severe sanctions were applied to the PSD, as well as to the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
The PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (at that rate of <0x24>82 million), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and was stipulated to limit the membership of its team in the Champions League during the 2014-1015 season by 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is tracking clubs that may try to override its financial inspections by blooming its revenues at the expense of companies associated with the club’s owners.
Although the Qatari company could have sponsored the PSC, but if the amount of funding was considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of funding from the Qatar Tourism Office was inflated.
It was reported that a portion of Neymar’s earnings at the “PSG” could have come in the form of payments by the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar-2022 deny that Neymar will become the ambassador of the World Cup, and a similar maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA will keep an even more careful track of any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday by people familiar with the situation, UEFA did not hold preliminary discussions with the PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
They communicated with the agency "Associated Press" under conditions of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the position of "PSG".
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016 "PSG" received more than 10 million euros of profits with turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The report for the last financial year has not yet been published.
"PSG" expects the arrival of Neymar to be a favorable ground for sponsorship transactions, the sale of attributes and shirts with the team's logo.
The club assumes that the turnover will increase by at least 30 percent as a result of hiring a new player.
Undoubtedly annoyed by the fact that one of the best footballers is leaving, the Spanish league has tried to prevent Neymar's transfer, saying that the PSG will disrupt the financial "fair play".
“This is an obvious case of ‘financial doping’, with the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper, referring to the fact that Qatar is the ultimate owner of the PSG.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnat, shares La Liga’s doubts about the club’s state funding.
"It's all the consequences of participation, and it's completely changed the landscape of football over the last fifteen years," Wenger said.
“When the club belongs to the country, it can be anything.
It becomes very difficult to adhere to financial fair play because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and place of the oath shall be determined by the President
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation, the president will determine - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law have been drafted by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Building.
A week ago, the deputies were planning to directly determine the procedure for making an oath in the law.
Children under the age of 18, as well as disabled, will be released from the solemn oath, as follows from the revised text of amendments to the bill "About the citizenship of the Russian Federation" (is available "Izvestia"), which the committee will consider before the second reading on 11 July.
The idea of introducing an oath upon entry into the Russian citizenship instead of the formal signature of the documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin during a meeting with State Duma spokesman Vyacheslav Volodin on June 6.
Deputies have formulated this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the draft law, which provides for the cancellation of the decision on the extradition of citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a series of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature.
According to the bill, its logic was as follows: by issuing documents for citizenship, a person is signed under the promise of complying with Russian legislation - he is on the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
In April, the draft law was introduced to the State Duma by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasilyev (“United Russia”), Gennady Zyuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov (“Justice Russia”) and spokesman D.D. Vyacheslav Vyacheslav.
On May 19, it was adopted by the deputies at first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for second reading, but now it has been revised again.
Now it says that the procedure for making an oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On the citizenship of the Russian Federation", specifying that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting before the state flag and the flag of Russia in the presence of the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - a list of places where it is possible to place the emblem of the Russian Federation, regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of state bodies of subjects, municipal entities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive authorities, etc.
Most likely, it could also be a scam.
To make a solemn oath those wishing to obtain Russian citizenship will be after officials check their documents.
But the Russian passport a person will only receive after he has made a vow, follows from the refined text.
A week ago in the draft it was said that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text says that Russia will be sworn in from the age of 18, not from the age of 14.
The rule remains that those who are not able or are limited in their ability to act will be exempted from the oath, as well as those who are unable to pronounce, read or sign the oath text themselves.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure and "other persons",
Also in the updated bill is prescribed a special procedure for admission to the Russian citizens of the residents of Ukraine, who are considered to be carriers of the Russian language.
They will have to formally waive Ukrainian citizenship by submitting a corresponding statement to the authorized body of Ukraine for this purpose.
A notarized copy of the statement will have to be sent to Russian officials.
A waiver of "foreign" citizenship, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible "for reasons other than the person".
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among which the first Deputy Speaker DG Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalya Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninkov and Irat Farrakhov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a visa from Ukraine is unrealistic, simply impossible.
Accordingly, very many people are waiting for their fate to decide on the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the head of the Duma Committee on State Building and Legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text clarified that the restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who have writtenly waived "other" citizenship and issued the former passport in the Ministry of the Interior of Russia, but "for reasons not dependent on it" did not stop him.
It is now forbidden to foreigners to hold positions in the municipal service, to be admitted to work on facilities and in organizations whose activities are related to ensuring the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual nationality or residence permit in another country cannot become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force from 1 September 2017, by the time necessary sub-legislative acts must be prepared.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in "American Summer Jar" and "Detective Camp"
The current iteration of the story is nostalgically reminiscent of the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; of the age of grenade in the 90s (approximately at a time when outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Shovaler were the ones who made the comedy of the 2001 series, "The State of the Mind," and "The State of the Mind."
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time an uplifting and embodiing of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems an anachronism.
The “First Day of Camp” was surprisingly good, and not just because of the absurd humor (including the original story of a talking pot of vegetables, which was voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually preoccupied children who have only reached adulthood; thanks to this, the impossibility of returning to become part of the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults were already played as adults, has less emotional roots, and its parody is more systemic and includes reefs from stalkers movies of the 90s, like "Hands That Shoot the Crowd."
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991".
Many of the storylines are the same.
The Charity Cup (Showalter), now a writer, has not yet achieved reciprocity from Katie (Marguerite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn’t broken up with virginity.
And there’s also a crazy and ugly plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Shooter), who is now encouraged by George Bush the Elder (a tried-and-tested parody as Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the withdrawal from it.
It’s especially fun to see eternally young Radd, who sings Matt Dillon’s song from “The Lonely Ones,” whose character, the former great man Andy, now looks old.
To bring this franchise to success could be random madness in the spirit of the kind of recursive series "Seven Up", until it comes to what I think would be its logical ending: "Hot summer is hotter than the American summer" was "twenty years later", where it followed.
"Detective Warrior" in the Amazon refers to another type of nostalgia: memories of the Cold War from the "Americans", "The Explosive Blonde" or even "The Flash" with her images of the struggle of the East and the West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Riz Thomas, depicts the television film: the Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and Marxist-Pussy.
The main roles - the life-showing Gregor and idealist Joseph - are performed by Florin Pierce Jr. and Cornelius Street, and their dialogues in English were voiced by Channing Tatum (he himself is executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-L.
That's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are several visual jokes (the police spend time watching a chess game, as Americans could watch football).
The team of famous behind-the-scenes voices - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevini - makes it interesting to play the " guess the voice".
But "Detective Warrior" is so deemed to be the credibility of the unfathomable propaganda drama - there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask, which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are delayed, and it's funny not very and not often.
If it were to be shortened, the "Detective's Crowd" could better cope with his satire in the spirit of Agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the U.S. Embassy, there are two fat people sitting in the lobby.
To the imaginary spectator-communist, this image tells that Western culture is capable of making food from anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with them as well.
The prize fund of the match for the Russian Super Cup of football between "Spartak" and "Lokomotiv" will amount to about 30 million rubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergei Pradkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, RT reports.
He also added that there are almost no tickets for the match so far.
The match "Spartak"- "Lokomotiv" will take place on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
As noted by TASS, "Spartak" - the current champion of the Russian Federation, and "Lokomotiv" is the owner of the Cup of the country.
Two young Uphims cleaned the furniture workshop for 200,000 rubles
A 37-year-old Ufimeti, who has a furniture company, turned to the police.
The man reported the theft of expensive tools from the workshop, which caused serious damage to its production.
Mining drills were tools with a total cost of almost 200,000 rubles: two welding machines, drill, hydraulics, shovel.
The guards of the order began to search for the criminals and soon went on to the residents of the Blagoveshchensk district of Bashkortostan, friends 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, the accomplices penetrated the territory of the enterprise, broke the entrance door and took out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold stolen equipment to the first car service.
The case of theft has already been initiated, and law enforcement has managed to return only a portion of the stolen instruments to the legitimate owner.
The State Department commented on Medvedev’s words on relations between Russia and the United States
The United States and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State Deputy Minister Heather Nauert in response to the words of the Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev on relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to hopes of improving bilateral relations and declared the Russian Federation a full trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a "low level", but noted that it is necessary to search for "zones for interaction".
"Look at the ceasefire in southwestern Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
“And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia,” RIA Novosti said.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign policy ministry refused to comment on the Russian prime minister’s statement that the sanctions are equivalent to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea was signed by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday.
At the same time, he acknowledged that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior has grown roses from amethysts and quartz
The jewelry unit of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - complemented the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
In them appeared five new rings and three necklaces-chocolate on barhat tapes.
In the line of Rose Dior Pré Catelan released two new rings and pendants from amethysts, pink quartz and diamonds, made in the technique of glyptic (hand-knitting on stone) and respect and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of the Dior Joaillerie Victoire de Castellan was inspired by the roses that model Christian Dior raised in his estate in Granville, and the Paris Gardens of the Rich and Pre-Catellan.
Trump found guilty of deteriorating relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump has been critical of congressmen.
According to the U.S. leader, their actions have led to deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedentedly low and dangerous level.
“You can thank Congress, these same people can’t even give us medicine,” the president tweeted.
Earlier, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea.
In particular, they will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House later issued a statement by the president in which he stated that the law would not allow the United States to make profitable deals and would further rapproche Russia, China and North Korea.
Belarusian Entrepreneur Refused to Buy Ukrainian Daughter Sberbank
The Belarusian entrepreneur Victor Prokopenia has withdrawn from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC with the intention of “focusing on other of our planned investments and projects that we are working on.”
According to Mr Prokopeni, such a move will be "the best investment of time", despite the investment attractiveness of buying Sberbank's daughter.
Prokopenia became the main claimant for the acquisition of the Russian bank’s unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the NorvikBank consortium, Grigory Guselnikova, and the Belarusian company, Said Guceriev, in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiary structures in March.
One of these financial organizations - in addition to VTB and Vneshekonombank - became Sberbank.
Novak named the cause of blackout in Crimea
In the Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation named the cause of blackout in the Crimea.
Explanations on what happened were given by the head of the department, Alexander Novak.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a road traffic accident in the territory of Krasnodar region.
The truck hit the transmission line, as a result of the disconnection of Cuban and related Crimean networks.
Failures in electricity supply to major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The specialists resolved the problem within a few hours.
It was initially reported that the cause of the blackout could be abnormal heat.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have forced rumors of a possible rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain steady, and has left interest rates unchanged amid growing pressure on family incomes.
Experts from the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with a score of 6 to 2 for maintaining rates at 0.25%, while this month fewer committee members voted for an increase in the rate because weak economic growth weakened support.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to an increase of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on family income will continue, while it is still expected that inflation will rise to about 3% in the fall.
However, the bank warned that rising rates in the next few years would be necessary to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said that loan expenses would likely have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted in favour of abandoning part of the huge set of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close its emergency financing plan, under which it provides banks with cheap loans, although it has reported that it is now to provide an additional <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion – up to <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion – as part of the plan.
According to MPC’s basic forecasts, GDP growth will remain slow in the near future, while pressure on real incomes continues to affect consumption, the bank said.
On the issue of interest rates, he reiterated that in order to stop inflation, it would require “some tightening of financial policy” in “some size” more than markets expect.
At the moment, markets are forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases will be "stupid" and "limited".
The bank’s forecasts for an increase this and next year were lower than those made in May, which were 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank remained unchanged by 1.8% in 2018.
After these news, the sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to <0x24>1.31 and by 0.4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent inconvenient growth rates weakened the growth expectation; GDP then grew by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth, apparently, will remain at the level of 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank’s latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice households, which were hit by high inflation and slight increases in wages: according to the bank, the pressure will increase before how to reduce.
The bank added that financial policy “cannot prevent” success in earnings in the next few years, but expects wages to “significantly” recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also geared towards growth as a result of the growing demand for British goods, which is due to the low <0xC2><0xA3> rate, which offsets part of the lower consumer spending.
The decision was taken a year after rates were reduced to 0.25% last August after the shocking results of a referendum on exit from the European Union that drew the pound down.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last rate decision, the noise around the expected rate increase increased, as inflation was increasingly pressing on and so under strong pressure households: three members of the committee of specialists were asked to raise the rate to 0.5%.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although, according to the bank, this decline was expected and will be compensated again in the coming months.
According to the bank, a higher rate compared to the planned 2% is entirely the result of a low pound rate.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco’s Mortgage Brokers, said: “If you take into account the recent swap rate drop, it seems that the mortgage market will become even more competitive again as lenders demand business opportunities and rely on trust.
The market looks particularly favorable for those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing of loans, often with the possibility of no commission, as well as with a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.”
State Health Service Prescribes Disputed HIV Drug for 10,000 People
Starting in September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug for the prevention of HIV after the battle in the High Court on the issue of funding of the drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposure prevention of HIV (PrEP), a pre-sex pill that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in people who are at risk for a lifetime, will now be protected by an average of 86 percent.
She agreed to finance the trial after the appeals court backed last year’s High Court ruling that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay for the PrEP, despite its claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, which was announced on Thursday, was called the “most important innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it a “turn point.”
Before the full launch of the program across England by April 2018, venerological distributors in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, and even more distributors will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
As studies have shown, PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PrEP before sex in the human body, a sufficient amount of certain drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to the drug include gay and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-positive and are not receiving a successful treatment.
Dispensers will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender and individuals whose partners are unknown if their HIV status is deterred by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for a potential participation in the upcoming venerological distributor participating in the program.
The program will cost <0xC2><0xA3>10 million, and the National Health Service of England signed a contract for the drug this week following an international procurement tender.
The study is designed to assess all the potential of PEP for the collection of clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its absorption and its large-scale use.
“This crucial innovation must complement and strengthen the broader and increasingly successful efforts aimed at preventing HIV.
This is another milestone for more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the biggest health threats faced by humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of the NAT (National Office for the Control of the Proliferation of AIDS), said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
The PEP, if appropriately targeted at people in need and at risk, gives the opportunity to change the situation with the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people in the HIV risk group, thanks to this study conducted in England on behalf of the National Health Service, will have access to a new opening new possibilities of a tool, the use of which can be controlled by a person, knowing that it is not discussed with the public.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Jan Green, President of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “Now, first of all, we need to make sure that the test is rapidly deployed across the country and that none of the HIV risk group is forgotten.
Now that we’re provided with the experimental drug PrEP, we’re going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.”
Sharon Hodgson, the shadow minister of public health, said: “We very welcome the start of the PrEP test, it has been very late because of months of delays and cramps on the part of the government.”
The data demonstrate how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this rock infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PREP.
It is now important that the test be implemented as soon as possible across the country to protect people at risk for HIV and to advance us further towards a step towards halting the spread of HIV in society.
World Congress of Tatars adopts resolution on support for the treaty between Tatarstan and Russia
The sixth congress of the World Tatar Congress (WKC) adopted a resolution in which it highlighted the importance of preserving the presidency in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is a "positively confirmed form of organization of the supreme state authority in the republic and expressing the national interests of the whole Tatar people".
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the treaty on the distinction of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole".
The treaty between Moscow and Kazan, in force since 24 July 2007, was concluded for 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the Tatarstan State Council appealed to the President of Russia to extend the agreement and maintain the appointment of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only entity of the federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called the “President”.
In Russia, there were difficulties in obtaining international driving licenses
The GIBDD units are experiencing a shortage of international driving licences (IMCs).
To get such rights, you have to wait a few weeks in a row, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go abroad on vacation in their car or rent it there.
It should be noted that the situation with international driving licences remains contradictory.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, as the information is explained in five languages.
The requirements of international law are enshrined in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968, but in the countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian law is still recognized.
However, in fact, everything depends on specific police or leasing offices: some require the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and someone has enough national rights.
To insure, drivers of international rights still receive, but it is worth taking into account that in countries that have not ratified the convention (e.g., the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
There is now a problem with forms in almost all units of the GIBDD, Kommersant reports, conducting a study in a number of regions.
Thus, in Moscow, in the units of the UGIBDD, plates are simply not issued, the forms have been missing for four months.
You can sign up for the reception on the website of the state services, but there is already extended to mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk it is impossible to get the Ministry of Foreign Affairs "for technical reasons", without entering into the details, in the Samara region honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation occurs in other cities.
Many Moscowites have already faced the problem, there are more and more such messages on social networks:
Irina Burmistrova: “Guess why international rights cannot be obtained in Moscow?”
That's right, because all the GIBDD offices have completed the forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A Question to Known People!"
International law needs to be obtained urgently.
In Moscow all the time is pushed forward, at the place the talons are not issued at all (button is there, but the talon can not give).
It's like a public service portal shows that in SPB free time before the fiddle.
Has anyone tried to get it in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation, the requirements for the forms of international driving licences have changed, therefore, new forms are being delivered in the Gosavtoinspection department.
This may be related to the deficit, although it is unclear what changes are being discussed, not previously reported.
Blanki is purchased by the Center for Special Designation in Road Traffic Safety (CSN BDD) of the Ministry of Interior of the Russian Federation and then supplies them to the units of the GIBDD.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with Goznak Company: in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand forms were produced by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in 2016, 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on 18 July.
There is a version that the CSN simply failed to hold the tender in time, which is why there was a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to travel on their own not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are accepted there, until the end it is unclear, so people are reinsured, so there was an intense demand for international "shorts".
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to pass the exam to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by the Ministry of Transport.
The International Driving Certificate (IVA) of the new model has been in force since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
Ukraine’s Minister of Justice Pavel Petrenko said he does not believe in Russia’s ability to build a bridge in the Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the Watcher portal.
No self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or a hat there, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan – in countries that have joined sanctions against Russia against Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, the prospects for this project are virtually absent," - said Petrenko.
He added that he believes Russia is unable to implement a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build even less-sized facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, entire stadiums have already begun to be destroyed.
“Therefore, I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have proved so invisible to join this project,” the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the car arch of the Crimean Bridge.
On the Kerch coast, an enlarged assembly of the highway arch of the Crimean bridge is completed: its fence will be closed at a height of 45 meters from the foundation of the construction.
"At the same time, the bridge builders prepared to install the railway arc on the railroad supports," - said in the information center of the project.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Maxim Sokolov informed the President of Russia Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility is going ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge connects the Crimean peninsula and the Krasnodar region.
In Spain, an official who has not worked for 10 years has been fired.
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the head of the Spanish official, Carlos Resio, have had?
The permanent walk was extended for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Resio was still fired.
But not his immediate boss.
Nothing happens in the world of bureaucrats.
Visitors seem to have long been accustomed to all the cravings of “the servants of the people.”
And yet, officials are always able to surprise those on whose taxes they live not badly.
This time the “sensation” came from Spain.
There, Valencia’s archivist Carles Resio has been unable to go to work for ten years.
He had a complaint on a regular basis.
And the whole solid - 50,000 euros a year.
Mr. Reesio’s “weird times” are over.
He was fired by the Legislative Assembly of Valencia.
The investigation found that an evil walker came to the office every working morning at 07:00 to mark in the electronic system.
And he went home right away.
He appeared again at the workplace at 4:00 p.m. to remark on the system that he had left.
And so 10 years.
It was also known that all his free time the walker devoted to drawing comics on the house.
Now the deputies of the Valencian Legislature are thinking about how to punish and direct boss Mr. Resio, who could not have known how to "actively work" in his workplace his subordinate.
Judges propose to protect from presidents
The Presidential Council on Human Rights (HRC) on the orders of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The SCC proposes to limit the powers of the presidents of courts and to introduce their election.
For the courts of the appeal and cassation authority, the SPD wants to introduce special districts, which will not be bound to administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
Its proposals in the framework of the presidential mandate should also be submitted by the Supreme Court.
The SPD has completed the drafting of proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out on the order of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the president gave after a meeting with the members of the council.
The meeting with the members of the council on 8 December 2016 discussed, among other things, individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as issues of public control in places of detention of citizens (see "<0xD0><0x95>" of 9 December).
As a result of the work of the SCC, 25 proposals were made, which concern both issues of ensuring the independence of judges and the detection of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin’s human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of courts to increase the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate for the position of judge has successfully passed the contest and has received the support of the judicial community, then the chairman of the court, in the opinion of the SPC, must submit it to the appointment, not having the right to refuse, as the law now permits.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to allocate cases to judges.
To do this, experts allow, may be a specially written computer program.
The SCC also considers that the chairman is not entitled to "predetermine the results of the judge's qualification certification, initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments".
At the same time, the presidential council considers it necessary to move to the “election of the presidents of courts as judges themselves” and “attribute their powers for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation.”
Now all the presidents of the courts (from the republican to the district) are appointed as president for a six-year term on the submission of the president of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the SCC proposes to reorganize appeals and appeals in courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The SPD says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation bodies not at the level of regional judiciary bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts".
Experts are based on the practice of arbitration courts.
There are “judiciary districts” that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but that guarantee a great independence from regional officials, which make the use of “phone right” difficult.
The World Court of Justice proposes that the People’s Assembly be strengthened to consider some “categories of civil and administrative matters” with their participation.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honor and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"These are just our proposals," - explained "I" member of the SPD, judge of the Constitutional Court in the resignation of Tamar Morshakov.
She also reminded that the president’s mandate was not only for the SPD, but also for the Supreme Court, which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
The time for the execution of the task at the military (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General and the Human Rights Commissioner in the Russian Federation) is still there.
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation, Vyacheslav Lebedev, the chairman of the army, is required by September 1.
Living a high life: half-floor and clever design techniques turned this small apartment in Earls Court into a spacious apartment
Joan Lee, a former banker passionate about real estate repairs, moved from a spacious house in Nightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is located on the first floor of a cute typical house in the style of Queen Anna, and in favor of a new design says that Joan has not collected her belongings and has not moved again.
“I used to live with my ex in Nightsbridge on a much larger area,” says Joan.
“I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings here.
I fell in love with her and offered the price the same day.”
From the moment of the first view of the apartment with an area of 1000 square feet carried out a complete reconstruction.
Originally it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout – to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add space to store things and a half-floor to get the most out of the generous height of the ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, large windows, a lot of light.
Those were my demands,” she says.
For this purpose, she hired Herfan Azadi from the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed in Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings and create a housing that would not only be a successful project, but would welcome Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to arrange two rooms over each other, so the architectural task was to create a half-floor where you could stand in full growth.
Erfan had to think creatively in order to deal with the letter.
“Working with steel structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We had to place the rooms so that they were above each other, and we didn’t have to bend.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to curve the structures so that they were at the right height and allowed to use the premises above and below.”
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms over each other in the space – and much more interesting.
From the semi-floor through the vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius" opens to the chic living room downstairs.
Mirror furniture with gold finish, silver accents and vintage lighting devices from Serge Muya set the project style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacle, space and light.
The short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a mirror protective panel looks like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirror cabinets are used to store all Joan's dishes.
To create a sense of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can enclose the kitchen when it is not used.
There is nothing new in the foldable kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is moving up the door like in a garage.
“Engineering art was involved here,” – Erfan will tell about the reinforced steel wooden-fibre shielded door.
“It’s equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slips very easily.”
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom, and improved planning.
“At the end of the day, the floor area is exactly what you’re going to sell, that’s what your property is valued for,” says Erfan.
"In a nutshell, the real estate trade agent will enter and make calculations based on the floor area."
Here they were able to increase the area of the floors, using quality materials, which give the space shades of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection with the home,” says Erfan.
“No one is in love with the electrical wiring in the walls.
It’s important, but it doesn’t touch the strings of our hearts.”
This serves as a testament to the fact that due to the good design and the increased metering of the apartment can turn from something ordinary to something amazing.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government Approves the Establishment of a Commission on Cultural Policy
The Russian government approved the establishment of a commission on state cultural policy.
The relevant decree was published on the Government's website.
According to the document, the main task of the Commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify the objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The head of the commission is appointed by the vice-president of the government of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the committee will be approved separately.
In 2016, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved a plan to implement the strategy of state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 events and measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve the unified cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries decreased to an 8-year minimum
The rise in consumer prices in the G20 countries has fallen to the lowest in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, referring to data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The OECD estimates that the inflation rate in June 2016 was 2% - lower values were recorded in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a drop in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
Thus, the agency recorded its first weekly deflation in 2017.
The target of inflation in Russia, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the goal has already been achieved - according to this agency, the figure is 4%.
Putin Warns of Illegal Cutting of Bikal Taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin during a meeting on the ecological development of the natural Bikal territory warns against the illegal destruction of forests.
In the course of the event, the Minister of Natural Resources Sergei Donskaya noted that a bill had been prepared earlier.
It permits the deforestation during the fire eradication, and the government plans to adopt it as early as autumn.
In turn, the president said that the project should be monitored so that in the process of cutting “not everything is cut in a row”.
Donskoy noted that this bill involves monitoring by the ICC and supervisory authorities.
Media: VSU fighters secretly from command negotiate with Donbass militias
On the line of the armed confrontation in the Donbass is established regular telephone communication.
Fighters from the opposing sides are constantly communicating with each other on mobile phones, and they do not know about this communication in the headquarters.
WSU fighters and Donbass militias have arranged communication on mobile phones secretly from their high command.
On August 4, Strana.ua reported this with a reference to the members of the military operation in the Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know the names of their colleagues from the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily on the phone.
Communication is not at all domestic: the commanders are trying to reach some “tactical agreements”.
The result of such talks is often an armistice in a certain part of the front.
Journalists became aware of cases when a birthday congratulations were received by the officer because of the front line, from his formal enemy.
WSU fighters and DPR and LPR militias have been in the trenches on the line of demarcation since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine began a combat operation against the Donbass.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs angered the blocking of statements of the UN Security Council on attacks on the Russian Embassy
In the Russian foreign policy ministry are outraged by the actions of individual Western diplomatic representatives, who block UN statements in the press condemning the terrorist attacks of the Russian embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry reminded that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2 for the third time in a month was subjected to a gunfire by terrorist groups "Heyat Tahrir Ash-Sham" (formerly "Djabhat al-Nusra", banned in the Russian Federation) and "ArkhahF".
Taking into account that the international community unanimously qualifies Nusra as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for countering this structure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation noted that "it would appear that it is not a self-evidently a counter-evaluation."
However, as stressed in the diplomatic ministry, "for the third time in a month the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, in turn, varying the tonality of the statement of objections, to cover up the evidence of the alleged lack of information.
The unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us must remain on the conscience of these delegations.
“Most of all, the inability of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, makes them feel impunity,” they said in a statement to the Foreign Ministry, adding that “they don’t want these barbarians to get into trouble.”
Vladimir Putin advocates limiting the number of non-planned business checks
Russian President Vladimir Putin said during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East that the number of non-planned business inspections should be reduced to 30% from the number of planned, and also said the need to limit the duration of the inspections to ten days.
"Out-plan checks are usually carried out without proper agreement with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% agree with the prosecutor's office, everything else goes on its own," - the president quotes TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be banned from locating servers and hard drives in enterprises.
In addition, according to the president, business associations should have the right to protect the interests of their members in court.
“This, I hope, will bring some positive to the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurship, or related to violations of the law in the field of entrepreneurship,” the head of state said.
As reported by <0xD0><0x95>, due to the action of the moratorium on the conduct of planned inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is increasing.
In May, on the order of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, 8% was conducted an interrogation, which resulted in the fact that the replacement of the plan checks occurred by non-planned 1 (for those who encountered them), also increased from 21.9% (in 2015 to 30.8%, 8%, in 2016), by prosecutors (16.9%).

The brothers are fighting for real estate empire worth more than <0x24>500 million
The two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria’s largest empires in real estate trade worth more than <0x24>500 million – forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton football club director and builder Colin de Lutís lives in the Palace of Turk through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court for separation of possessions and assets.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court has so far held a fierce dispute over the terms of the divorce.
Together with her mother, Anna, the brothers own 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars that have been purchased since their family bought a store at Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded the company Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 shopping malls.
It was sold in 1999 for <0x24>85 million.
The money was invested in the property, and the De Lucis family’s list includes today office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mount Buller, and shopping centers in the suburbs.
According to the agreement with his late father Colin, whom Paul describes as "the main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lucis family, he owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million, and Paul is 176 million.
The section of property and money has become a stone of stumbling for Paul.
“The division proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property,” he wrote in his first statements in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts to reconcile, the first hearings were held in the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business – from which, according to Paul, Colin ruled it out.
Colin claims that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of certain objects.
In the statements given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian roots make me consider the family a top priority,” he wrote.
Judicial costs are growing as a snow comm: hundreds of pages of testimony, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are included in the case; both sides have attracted the most renowned lawyers, including the King’s Attorney General Allan Maerl.
Mrs. De Lucis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; from the late 1950s they ran dairy bars and restaurants, and in the early 1970s bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last class of school, and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old) at the time."
Anna De Lucis says they and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their possessions to their sons without conflict.
“Louise often told me that she didn’t want the brothers to be heard in court,” she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lucys group; Colin says Mark got <0x24>10 million when he left the business, and Luke got <0x24>26 million when he left the business.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were “dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their office.”
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL Club and, according to the 2015 biography of Eddie McGee, the best friend of the TV star.
The Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered, with a text message saying that, since the case has not yet been considered in court, "I really have nothing to say."
“I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to file a lawsuit against me and shake the name of our family in court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a statement that he was trying to satisfy his brother’s demands.
"Our father would not like to see me and Paul argue in court," he said, adding that "he still hopes for a resolution of the conflict."
On Friday, this hope seems to have disappeared.
“The decision on our case will soon be taken by the court,” Colin wrote.
The new head of the Trump apparatus plans to restrict information to the president.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly will really do that.
In that case, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House head of apparatus plans to limit the flow of information received from President Trump, including news reports from the media, hoping to keep the head in a quieter state.
That's what reporter Josh Dowzy reports.
“At a meeting held by the new White House head of apparatus John F. Kelly with the apparatus’s leadership on his first working day, he marked the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: the bad news channels are running.”
Kelly told employees that the information should pass through it — in paper form or through briefings — because the president would be better to make decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly’s diagnosis is completely true, but others have already failed, trying to calm Trump by tracking information from him.
President Trump’s relationship with television began a few decades ago — and now that he’s in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, was angry at the unfair illumination of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he was given fair illumination in publications that could have been convincing,” Sam Nanberg, the former adviser of the campaign, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri then wrote in Politico that “according to the six former members of the electoral staff, in order to keep Trump’s habit of writing on Twitter, it was necessary to ensure that there was a constant stream of praise in the information that came to him in person.”
All right.
But the idea that Trump’s habit of writing on Twitter was once “under control” is just ridiculous.
Perhaps these members of the electoral staff know something we don’t know — for example, that if they weren’t, Trump’s tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump hasn’t published.
If his employees saved him from trouble at least several times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has ever managed to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by providing Trump with material – reliable or not – that confirms their views.
"Political" - just to this story - wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly provide dubious information to the president.
Here is an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump employees say that Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks of information, and will not rest until he finds out who was behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone submitted to the president a printout of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocator Charles K. Johnson, in which deputy head of the apparatus, Kathy Welsh, was accused of "standing behind a row of leaks" in Bea.
It doesn’t matter that Johnson is forever banned on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he didn’t present concrete facts, or that in the past he launched false accusations and then renounced them.
“Trump read the article and agreed to ask employees about Welsh.”
Goldmacher adds that then-Chef of the Raines Pribus and Secretary of the Rob Porter were “trying to build a system to manage the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them.”
How did that work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
He may be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump is still impulsive in nature, and his assistants are still fighting for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen Prosecutor's Office Fights HIV Dissident
The prosecutor's office challenged the decision of the Kalininski State Court of Tyumeni, which ended the criminal case against a local resident who had died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother was HIV-dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court exempted her from responsibility for reconciliation with the victim's father.
The prosecutor's office believes that the crime should not be left impuned in order not to create a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against the resident of Tyumena was initiated under Art. 1 of 109 of the Russian Federation (causing death by negligence) in April - after the death of her three-year-old daughter from HIV infection in stage 4V.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
“The woman did not treat herself and gave up the treatment of her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist,” the prosecutor’s office said.
The criminal case was filed with the Kalinin District Court of Tyumeni, which on 25 July decided to terminate it.
The petition was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that "he forgave his wife, she had no complaints, she smoothed the damage and apologized".
The prosecutor's office disagreed with the court's decision and appealed, demanding that the decision to terminate the case be annulled and re-examined.
The girl is dead, and the damage caused by the crime is impossible.
The HIV-infected mother, despite the recommendations of the doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her from a dangerous infection,” the prosecutor’s office said in a statement.
According to the supervisory authority, it should be punished, otherwise its example will be followed by other HIV dissidents.
As told at the Tumeni AIDS Center, now in the Tumen region about 12 children who are HIV-positive do not receive medical care due to the refusal of their parents.
"And this situation has already improved - in the year of work of the special group half of the parents, who categorically refused to treat children with HIV, changed their mind - allowed to make a diagnosis, began to take drugs," - said the press secretary of the AIDS Center Elena Loseva.
According to her, it is impossible to legally influence parents, and as a result not all HIV-infected children can be detected - mothers do not allow them to be examined, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV dissidents?
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called HIV-dissident movement.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and AIDS service NGO activists call such views anti-medical, and see a serious threat in their spread.
A ghastly photo session, which ended in a tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Greek railway station in Khmelnitsky.
A funny company of young people who were smiling walked over the bridge over the railroads, where the freight train just stood.
One of the friends had the idea to make an impressive selfie on the roof of the car, reported "FACT" in the police communication sector in the Khmelnitsky region.
The boy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but due to his negligence, he crawled behind the transmission line and instantly got a shock.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station manager, who immediately called for an "emergency".
Before the arrival of the injured doctors were transferred to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of Khmelnitsky Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with burns of tuberculosis of 1-2 degrees.
His condition is now assessed by doctors as stable.
Law Enforcers remind that in recent times, extreme selfies are gaining popularity on the roofs of multi-storey, bridges, moving transport.
Police are urging people to be vigilant and not allow such photoshoots, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists Allow Oceans to Exist on Ancient Venus
There may have been oceans on the ancient Venus.
That’s what French scientists have suggested.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of the planet, Science News writes.
It turned out that on Venus, at the beginning of its history, oceans formed, in which there was 10% more water than now on Earth.
Previously, Arguments of the Week wrote that, according to the scientists’ hypothesis, the ocean could have existed on Mars four billion years ago.
Foreign experts in their research concluded that the water object was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.

Rock band Louna will present new album in Barnaul
The concert of the rock band Louna will take place in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album "Wonderful New World", which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The group is preparing a conceptual show that will become the brightest in the group’s concert history.
"Beautiful New World" is the fourth album by Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is associated with the famous novel "Of a Strange New World" by O. Huxley.
The new songs do not recount the book, but tell about a society that lives under the law of anti-Utopia, "blind faith in propaganda and enforced values."
Collecting money for the recording of the album was helped by the audience: on the site "Planeta.ru" project supported more than 1,200 people.
Her first album, "Make It Bigger!", was released in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians released the album "Time X" and in 2013 recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, the band Louna performed with the symphonic orchestra at the Crocus City Hall with the program "Songs of Peace".
Lusiné Gevorkyan (vocal), Vitaliy Demidenko (bass guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergei Ponkratiev (guitar), Leonid Kinzbursky (barabana).
The concert will be held at the Barnaul Club "Pharaoh" on October 17 at 19.00.
Ticket price: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the most popular bands on the Russian rock scene.
The group was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The group has won several times in different nominations for the "Chertova Dozen" parade.
The Tsiganes have crossed the pits and returned to the ‘street of millionaires’
Some of West Midland’s wealthiest homeowners are again clashing with decisive gypsies who have overcome the pitted municipal authorities to reoccupy the field next to their homes.
Tsiganes parked 20 homes on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihall Street, which was named the “millionaire street”.
With horses, infants and many homes on wheels, they returned after being expelled no further than in May, and they were not hindered by a pit excavated by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
The tactical company found a breakdown in the defensive structures and pushed its vehicles through the site, which was left unfenced to leave room for the trail.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihalla, saying it was “unable to solve this problem.”
An anonymous local resident said: “They came here on Monday night after they were expelled from Bentley Het, where they were sweeping stones in the past.”
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act, because they are absolutely incapable of solving this problem.
The Tsiganes were here in May, they were expelled, and here they are again.
Last night, more gypsies came, and today, maybe even more.
“Birmingham Municipality knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don’t like the fact that I continue to pay the municipal tax, and the municipality can’t even put an end to it.”
One local resident who wanted to remain anonymous said, “It’s funny, we just saw these gypsies leave for the last time, and here, please, this attack continues.”
This time there were more of them, and we even saw the horse on the shore.”
A municipality spokesman said: “We know about the illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and we are cooperating with Solihall Police; we are taking the necessary legal action to expel them as soon as possible.”
To help us in the case of collecting evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police by phone 101.
This allows us to make an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares champagne wine factory "New World"
GUP of the Republic of Crimea "Factory of Champagne Wines "New World" decided to share, by transforming "Factory of Champagne Wines "New World"" OAO, follows from the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anyukhina.
100% of the company’s shares will remain in the state ownership of Crimea.
The statutory capital of the company will be 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Crimean Ministry of Agriculture said that if there are no funds for the modernization of the plant within the next three years, there will be a threat of the plant stopping.
The output of the main assets in the enterprise is about 60-70%.
For the modernization of the enterprise needs 1.2 billion rubles. Due to the characteristics of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the budget income.
What remains is insufficient for the implementation of the modernization plan.
“Getting money from the owner is problematic, it is difficult to talk about attracting loan funds from large credit institutions,” said Sergey Petelin, deputy chief of Crimean Mineselchoz in April.
The Crimean Parliament has included the enterprise in the projected privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to hold its shares and be put on auction.
The source of "Interfax" in the authorities of the Crimea estimated the possible cost of the sale of the enterprise in <0x24>40 million, the investor's investment in the modernization - another <0x24>30 million.
“New Light” in 2016 increased the production of wines by 2.8% compared to 2015 – up to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, “New Light” intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lviv Golitsyn as a wine-making plant in the name of the New World he acquired.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third-graders destroyed more than 40 tombs
Officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Nizhny Novgorod region identified the identities of citizens who destroyed 46 tombs at the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The attackers were third-class students.
The first statement that the burial plates were damaged by unknown, came to the OMVD of Russia in Lyskovsky district as early as June 27.
In all, 24 people have been contacted by the police.
As a result, a criminal case under article 244 of the Law of the Russian Federation "Destruction, damage or defamation of burial places" was initiated.
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing monuments fall, which prompted them to act as hooligans.
Preventive activities were carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening the tone with respect to the ships of NGOs that rescue migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs owned by rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue their work unless they comply with the new rules governing their activities.
“If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities,” Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the daily newspaper Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization "Jugend Rettet" on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal gambling.
The humanitarian organization, which has worked for a whole year, declined to comment on the substance of the detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human lives is and will remain a top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue our search and rescue activities now," the organization said in a statement.
“We will be able to assess all the charges that have been filed now only after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventus ship belonging to the Jugend Rettet since October.
His crew is suspected of taking on board entire rescue boats of migrants, sent directly to them by human traffickers, and of allowing smugglers to go along with boats that they could reuse.
At least one such meeting is thought to have taken place just 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, the indictment claims, the content of which was published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities that control the rescue operations in the area, rather than humanitarian raids on any other grounds.
The Code of Conduct mainly implies that Juventus courts will have an Italian police officer on board who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code: "Save Children", the Maltese MOAS and "Pro-Activa Extended Embraces" from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considers the new rules unnecessary, but acceptable, provided that they do not bring any “significant changes or interference” to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there are also the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Physicians Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support Libya’s coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are fruitful.
“In the last few days we started seeing light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
“In Libya, we don’t want to associate with either side of the conflict.”
The authorities of the Russian Federation have recently markedly stepped up their policy in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow participated delegations of the opposing Libyan sides.
The head of the Russian contact group on intra-Libyan settlement with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, the assistant of the head of the Chechen Republic Lev Dengov told “Y” what goals Moscow is pursuing in this region and who is betting on.
Almost nothing is known about the Libyan contact group you are heading.
Here, let's say, the contact group in Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
Here's the secret curtain.
What exactly do you do, what goals do you pursue?
The contact group was established on the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Its activities are curated by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Deputy Duma from Chechnya. - "I").
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan direction by State Duma spokesman Vyacheslav Volodin.
The momentum for the formation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mehanic Chebotarov" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "I").
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military experts, representatives of the State Duma was established, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
And how did it turn out that you led her?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group.
Our activity was not limited to the release of the sailors from "Mechanics of Chebotarev".
We managed to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups confronting each other in the Libyan conflict - and from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government headed by Faiz Sarajevo is based. - "I", "I"), and with the "Haleuk" (residence of the parliament, which is based on the United Nations-led government led by Faiz Sarajevo.
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Vice Prime Minister of Libya - "I"), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize in particular: in Libya we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict, we are conducting a dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
There are now five people in the contact group.
Among them are people who have experience working in force structures, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to include a group of specialists in the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East RAN.
None of our staff is permanently in Libya, and that is not necessary yet.
Are there Russian military advisers, instructors in Libya now?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this do not correspond to reality.
But in your contact group, ex-military members are...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or such cities closed to a certain point for us, such as Misurata (where militia units are based, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and have significantly increased in subsequent years).
We arrived in Missouri in January of this year.
We were frightened, we were told there were all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to evaluate the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why such rumors are going, what the role of Islamists is actually there.
In Misurata, we met with all the representatives of the forces that were engaged in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016 this city on the Mediterranean coast was repulsed by the militants banned in Russia "Islamic State" - "I").
We wanted to look at them, get to know these people, check out the information that it was they who played a decisive role in destroying ISIS in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits to himself.
And what conclusion did you come up with?
Hasn’t the Islamic State in Libya won Haftar?
That's not what he did.
Haftar carried out operations on the other front, Benghazi.
And with ISIS in Sirte were fighting structures that were subordinate to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited people to Russia who carried out this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, the Libyan delegation received in the Council of the Federation, in the Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Rosgardia.
You, as we understand, are in all Libyan regions and probably imagine the moods of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections that were reached in late July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as has been the case several times in the past, will the agreements be broken, the hostilities resume, the parties will try to take power unilaterally?
For us a good signal has already been the fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to meet again, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, the two leaders have reacted extremely negatively to each other.
As for Russia’s position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misurata, and it was on that day that Haftar was boarding the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurata they did not believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people who came to us today."
But our task is precisely to show: we are not only supporting Haftar, we are conducting a dialogue with all the key actors in the Libyan conflict.
You and Haftar talked.
Does understanding with Russian partners on a human, emotional level make it easier for him to study in the USSR twice?
And, by the way, does Haftar speak Russian?
Russian, if you know it, is relative.
But what he has learned from us, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And not just with him, by the way.
When we talk to the military in Tripoli and Misurata, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or still in the Soviet Union.
And that's why they speak Russian very well.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent experiencing nostalgia on it.
Do you think it is likely that the arms embargo imposed against Libya will be repealed immediately?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I have already said, we do not take sides in this conflict and would not like to arm one another to the detriment of the other.
We would like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
As far as the arms embargo is concerned, there are constant calls from Libyans for Russia to somehow facilitate its withdrawal.
Libya is now actively advancing the process of drafting a constitution.
We hope that the parties will come to compromise decisions, that they will reach an internal consensus.
Then the elections, as discussed at the meeting between Sarajevo and Haftar, must take place.
If elections are held and a legitimate power is finally elected (and now none of the parties has such status), then the question of lifting the arms embargo can be put in the UN Security Council.
To raise this issue now is pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to a escalation of the conflict.
It has been reported in the media that Italy, facing the problem of floating African refugees from Libya, feels thrown into the hands of EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using their ties with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is it that the Haftar troops will establish control of the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers relocating immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need Russia’s support, because Moscow is simultaneously in dialogue with Haftar, Sarajevo, Misurata and the south of the country.
And in this matter, the tribes in southern Libya play a major role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about the Southerners intercepting the flows of migrants on long-distance footpaths?
I mean, conditionally speaking, were the buses back-to-back that Nigerian migrants are going to take?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these streams going.
We hope to help bring the South together in the negotiating process between Sarajevo, Haftar and the tribes of the South.
But first, we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Sarajevo.
The head of government in Tripoli Faiz Saraj is considered an Islamist, a proponent of the country's introduction of sharia rules.
How radical is it that he holds?
Wouldn’t that be an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I'll give you my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he, on the contrary, is an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country – a moderately Islamic, open world.
He is also actively fighting terrorists.
How did he get such a reputation?
It is created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, there is legislative, executive and judiciary power.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not letting us down there.
And we mixed them all the cards and started actively communicating with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And let us reap the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded an agreement on cooperation with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
NOC director Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rossnefti chief Igor Sechin made a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago there was the first shipment of Libyan oil company Rosneft.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess to resell.
What are the economic interests of Russia in Libya?
It plans to re-sign the contracts concluded with Muammar Gaddafi.
These include, in particular, previous agreements in the transport sector (railway construction), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Is there anything the Libyans can pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, as in the case of Iran, is it about the “petroleum in exchange for services” scheme?
I don’t know what the scheme will be, I don’t directly deal with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We're actually doing peacekeeping work there.
For us, the most important thing is to stop the bloodshed, help the Libyans to come to terms with each other so that they can establish order and that Libya ceases to be a favourable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task – to help the Libyan people and to push out terrorists from there.
Do you have data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to this day no one from Russia or other countries of the former Soviet Union is there.
He said he had about 50,000 phone records of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - "I") and the Russian language doesn't sound there.
What countries are these fighters from?
I don't want to go into those details.
Let's formulate the question differently.
How many militants in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are almost no Libyans among them, no more than 5%.
The rest are here.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan negotiations on the example of Paris?
There are plans like that.
We are conducting active negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and expressed their willingness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
There are still a few more visits to take place, and then, I hope, there will be clarity about the time and place of negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, charities collected money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
In the sub-Moscow museum commissioner "Melihovo", nine-year-old boy Sasha Macola, whose DCP, hydrocephalus of the brain and full blindness, on August 5 will receive a specialized runway as a gift.
A useful present will be presented to Sasha the Minister of Culture of the Moscow region Oksana Kosareva and the Director of the Museum Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the trainer was collected during the charity marathon "Don't Dare to Do Good", which took place in Melihovo on 15 July on the Day of the Memory of Chekhov.
On the eve of the marathon in the museum, Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino Chekhov district, received a letter: "I can't see my eyes at all, so I asked my mom to write this letter."
“I’d really like to get a runway as a gift so my legs are strong and I’d learn to walk a little bit.”
And then Sasha's dream came true!
After the presentation at the museum commissioner will take place "Concert-postscriptum" - a well-known pianist, the deserved artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melihova performed the choir of Voznesenskaya Davydova Desert, the callers of the workshop of Ilya Drozdihin, the students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Academy named after Gnesiny, the artists of the Melihova Theatre.
For visitors, auctions were held, a book fair was organized and a charity sale of souvenir products with the marathon logo.
The commissioner of the Museum "Melihovo" took the initiative to make the Day of Remembrance of Chekhov on July 15 a single day of charity in all the Museum of Podmoskva.
The 30-year-old resident of Olevsk Zhytomyr region near the local football stadium shot several times in the direction of the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was outraged by the noise, reported "FACT" in the communication department of the police of Zhytomyr region.
After that, the man went to a café located nearby.
In the building he had a conflict, during which a man used a device to shoot rubber bullets, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim is given the necessary medical care, there is no threat to his life.
Police and emergency medical assistance arrived at the scene, but the shooter was hidden by that time.
The law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He's got a device to shoot rubber bullets, which is sent for examination.
According to this fact, criminal proceedings under article 296 (humiliation) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine have been initiated.
The detainee is threatened with imprisonment for 3 to 7 years.
Remember, in Kiev on Lukyanovka in the area of Tatarskaya Street on the night of July 28, there was a shooting attack.
Michelle Carter sentenced for messages prompting Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for using text messages and phone calls to incite her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to spend 15 months in jail and another 5 years in prison.
Carter was found guilty in June of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at the hearing on Thursday: “My family was killed in grief.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum term of 20 years, but her lawyers said both she and Roy had suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, wearing red pants and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, tightening her hands and lowering her eyes.
"With her actions she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said.
“She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She did not acknowledge responsibility,” she said.
"She didn't show remorse."
But lawyer Carter said it was “a tragic case that she deeply regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his opinion, her "age, level of maturity, or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions."
The prosecutor read Roy Lynn Roy’s mother’s statement: “There hasn’t been a single day when I wouldn’t cry for the loss of my beloved son.
"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with it - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will stay with us forever," he said.
Sister Roy Camden Roy said she was constantly chasing after the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children’s aunts.
“Life with a person who has been with me since I was born is a pain that will remain with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
This case is likely to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that would provide for the responsibility for the advice of a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon dioxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case attracted the whole country's attention when it became known that he was pushed to suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang up, jump off the roof, shove yourself with a knife I don't know there are many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before she committed suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "You just have to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said Carter wanted to get attention through Roy's death, and banned her from communicating with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The opinions of the lawyers on this were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of the murder in Italy of her British neighbor on the apartment and was excused two years later.
The 30-year-old Knox published her special opinion in the Los Angeles Times, stating, "Michael Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Evgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a bird of high flight"
One of the best basketball players of the VTB League, 33-year-old Kit Langford left UNIX.
The departure of the American defender "Izvestia" commented on UNIX President Eugene Bogachev.
Keith made this decision on family circumstances, - said Evgeny Bogachev.
He has a young child, a wife who did not want to move to Kazan.
Kit wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played at UNIX for three seasons and showed a high level in each match, all 100%.
So I let him go like a bird of high flight.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and in his playing career.
Keith Langford played for three years at the Kazan club, winning the silver of the 2015–16 League.
In the 2016/17 season he was awarded the most successful player of the Euroliga season.
He scored 21.75 points on average for the match.
This is the second result since the award was established in 2004.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in Euroleague history to receive the award more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with China's "Shenzhen", Eurohoops said.
The American is expected to enter into a two-year contract worth <0x24>5 million.
Langford will be the second Euroliga star in July to move to the Chinese championship.
Earlier in the Chinese CBA moved to the ex-centre "Panatinaikos" Jannis Burusis.
The sun-burning tourist from Podmoskovskaya evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
Adygei rescuers today by helicopter evacuated from the mountainous region of the republic of the sub-Moscow tourist who received the strongest sunburns.
The man rested at the Fisht shelter, located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure, as well as difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuers were contacted by the leader of the turg group, who told that the man had received the burns during the trek.
Audi to modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
A day before the announcement by Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 cars.
The chairman of BMW said the company believes that “there are more intelligent roads than restrictions on driving”, referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is located – which have considered the possibility of banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday it was modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies called their move a retreat.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
But nitrogen oxides that are released by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automakers to install equipment that neutralizes diesel car exhausts is also rising, and maintaining a competitive price for cars is becoming difficult.
While German carmakers are being deployed, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has also been accused of beating influential car manufacturers and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying not to repeat the errors of “Folkswagen”, which concealed the use of so-called “destruction devices”, which during testing could smuggle the amount of harmful gases emitted in order to comply with the rules, and were disconnected under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Folkswagen leaders have been convicted, while the rest are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics department of the Audi engine development group was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zackeo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian, and is therefore not protected from extradition and may appear in court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was subject to a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing the system to circumvent European emissions rules and expanded the investigation, which had previously been focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is a source of disproportionately large share of Volkswagen’s revenue.
In Astrakhan, a visitor to a cafe paid for fake money
The police received a message from the employee of the branch of the bank about the discovery in the recalculation of the money received from the point of generalization, a suspicious bill of 5,000 rubles.
A study conducted at the Expert Criminal Center has shown that it is a fake.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia in the Astrakhan region, the banknote was paid by one of the visitors of the café, who bought the shouram.
It is worth noting that the cashier was not equipped with a device to determine the authenticity of the tickets.
Currently, the police are identifying persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a counterfeit ticket of the Russian Central Bank.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs calls on the residents of the Astrakhan region to be cautious when carrying out financial transactions; employees of commercial facilities are advised to install devices to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found a “infernal” planet where even iron can float.
For the first time studying the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were much surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts have noticed that water molecules are so heated by the light of a star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope captured the luminosity of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the planet's atmosphere to shine in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot Jupiters" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the Solar System, but located dozens of times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "earth" days a year, and its gas shell is rocked to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and southern France, but there are now concerns that climate change threatens it.
Lavanda has become worse growing due to the drought and infectious insect diseases; this has been the cause of constant headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shees, an expert from the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, says: “Lalanda in Provence is really under threat because in recent years this plant has felt the effects of climate change.
This affects the longevity of the lavender.
And there are also small cycads jumping on the leaves of insects carrying microbacterial bacteria; in very dry weather they become very many.”
There is a lot on the map.
Lavender not only attracts holidaymakers; lavender oil is very popular in perfumery and cosmetology.
“Instead of very long shells with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent.
Therefore, we have fewer parts that contain essential oil.”
The solutions that are currently being considered include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and removing drought-resistant varieties.
The Ambassador of Winter Universities-2019 met with the students of Krasnoyarsk
Twice-time World Hockey Champion, Ambassador of Winter Universities-2019 Alexander Semin met with beginners and distributed autographs to fans.
The meeting took place in the tent of Winter Universities-2019 as part of the thematic week dedicated to hockey with washing machine.
Any visitor of the tent could ride on horseback riding on the pitch with artificial ice.
In addition, staffs, quizzes and games were organized with the distraction of the souvenir products of the student games, embroidery from the aerobics federation.
Fifty schoolchildren participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much as possible on the sports courts and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of the training is hard work and a huge desire to do hockey.
"It is great that there is such a pitch in Krasnoyarsk as the tent of the Winter Universities 2019, where beginners can directly ask questions to the coaches of the teams," - said the champion.
To promote student sports and a healthy lifestyle among the Russians, the ambassadors of Winter Universities-2019 help.
The Universiade tent will operate throughout the summer season until September 25, according to the press service of the Winter Universiade Directorate-2019.
In the State Department commented on Medvedev's words
U.S. State Department official Heather Nauert, commenting at the briefing on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said the need to find “zones for interaction” with Russia.
In her words, such areas need to be found in order to "improve bilateral cooperation".
As an example of such a successful cooperation, Nauert called the ceasefire agreement on Syria.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
“And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other,” the diplomat said.
Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev’s assertion of a full trade war between Russia and the United States.
“If Russia has said that, of course, it has the right to speak, but I can’t say anything more about this,” the State Department spokeswoman said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, the head of the Russian government Medvedev said that Washington had declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said U.S. sanctions would last for decades.
In addition, the prime minister believes, the U.S. establishment "should have mocked" Trump.
Missing bodybuilder found on someone else's house lost memory in the sub-Moscow
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very spicy circumstances: he left the car salon to go to the toilet.
For seven days he was unsuccessfully searched by familiar and local people.
And Shamil was found in another man's house in Ramensky.
He was found completely naked by the owner in his toilet.
The Dagestan athlete could not explain how he was here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was gone.
Identify them helped announce his disappearance.
The doctors who arrived on the call recorded partial memory loss and brain injury at Hanmetov, the Mash public reported.
Athletes are likely to have other surprises.
The perpetrators who kidnapped Shamil probably had already visited his apartment, from which the keys were also stolen.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the oil and gas revenues received by the end of July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation reports.
The exaggeration, the agency explains, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the ruble compared to the monthly average of June used for the assessment, as well as due to the exaggeration of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of non-export forecasts.
"The deviation of the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly assessment corresponding to the Federal Act on the federal budget for 2017-2019 is forecast to amount to <0x2B>40.2 billion rubles in August 2017," the Ministry of Finance said in a statement.
Thus, the total amount of funds directed to the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic currency market in the period from 7 August to 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily purchase volume of foreign currency will amount to the equivalent of 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Russia.
Each working day during the specified period, the CB will make transactions of foreign exchange purchases on the organized trades of the Moscow Stock Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The foreign currency acquired will be credited to the Federal Treasury account in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist underscores that in Mexico it is becoming more and more dangerous.
Officials of the weekly newspaper Riodose usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to shed light on the latest violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing drug war code.
But today, oppressed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking children with them to the office where they had already dropped a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote on the board hanging in the room, three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - no evidence is needed, suspicions and inner feelings will be enough.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being in government or cartels, a whole list of smugglers that make work to illuminate the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence does not give breath, and among the bodies that are multiplying in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, no less than 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people have been washed in this person; after the attacks and threats, they are under protection.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspiration, co-founder of Riodose, Javier Valdes Cardeñas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdes wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence is felt very sharply, although his presence everywhere - a large photo of Valdes, showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the façade of the building "Riodose"; his two journalists, Aaron Ibarra, and Miriam Ramirez.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, and paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Federal Prosecutor for the Investigation of Journalism was established in 2010, only two cases have been investigated, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders perpetrated each year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists’ killers rarely go to court.
The Riodose journalists insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed by grief, though now much more dangerous.
“Without information about the killers, without justice from security talks at meetings, it is little useful,” Ibarra said.
"It's very stupid to spend time on this seminar," he says.
“Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the office of Riodose in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to travel only a few blocks before his red Toyota King was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means "The Twelve River".
The shooter left his car and smashed it near him.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually spread quickly across Kuliakan.
Almost everyone is silent about Valdez.
Since Guzmán was arrested and released in the United States in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival factions struggle to fill the formed vacuum.
Let’s not say that one or more people are killed every day in the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with two-storey mausoleums of drug kings, which are more than the homes of many living people.
Let’s forget for a moment that the state of “silence” is just when one of the cartels takes control of the coastal state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodose, was overwhelmed by a sense of guilt for failing to protect a friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the murder.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso López, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, which is fighting Guzman’s sons.
The publication could have angered the sons; people who were supposedly members of the gang bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Waldes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper, which wrote about the same story, was captured.
Valdes was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was regarded as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been away from danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste and in 2003, along with five colleagues, founded Riodose, selling his <0x24>50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching on the topic of drugs," Bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publishing, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to the fact that in this issue they could read about what no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after her founding, Riodose received the prestigious Maria Mures Cabo Award for her work as a reporter in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Award for Courage in Investigating the Drug Trafficking in Mexico, wherever it leads.
He honestly admitted that he was frightened.
“I want to live further,” he said at the CPJ Awards.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is “a way of life,” he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last year.
“You have to take on the tasks that lie with you as a journalist – either that way or you’re just fooling yourself.”
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodose employees miss Valdes, a joker who roared like a harbor freighter, a friend generously embraced and advised, a teacher who knew how to suck alive.
They relied on the order they were given.
He always had to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, a bar in front of the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Did he destroy the love of the one-time order?
His death forced them to question in their calculations how best to do their job and stay alive.
“They don’t like when you get to know their wives, children, their legal business, and underground airports for drug transportation.
"These things were on the line," Bohorkes said.
The result, even at the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to believe in your instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says Riodose editor Andrés Villarreal, is that “the obscenity can be deceiving ... and then what happened to Javier.”
The old rules, he says, and others no longer apply in Sinaloa — as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a toxic mixture of profitable smuggling routes, weak state institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodose employees gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to put in cell phones: a few days before it became known that spy programs sold exclusively to governments were used in Mexico by journalists and public activists.
Outside, two policemen hide in the shade of a tree from 104 degrees Celsius (40 degrees Celsius).
They were given the task of the state government to guard the office of Riodose, which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois quarter of Kuliacan.
Some journalists were asked if these police officers were among the 50 percent of the officers of the order that the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that is de facto under the control of gangs of drug dealers.
In the nearest issue, Riodose had three main topics.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio César Chávez.
They also had a disclosure of government spending concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of Kuliakan's most expensive restaurants, in the neighborhood from the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant of drug dealers and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of power for almost the past century.
Recently, loud accusations of corruption have been made against several governors of PRI.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in the restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo Husman slipped from the military.
A few months ago, readers would have searched for the Valdes column with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
“We would have known before what happened,” says 46-year-old Villareal, for his slim body shape called El Flaco.
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Valdes’s office is now being used as a poster and sticker warehouse to protest the murders of journalists because employees have become what they never thought they would become: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramírez took several posters and went to the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor’s office dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adama disappeared in Michoacán, in the western part of the country, three days after Valdes was killed.
They found the body burned, and authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the streets and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., trying to get international support in demanding justice in the Valdes case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdes Ramirez, she accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
After that, she asked her not to give her any more tasks to shed light on the government’s activities, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdes has said many times that journalists in Mexico are “circled” by organized crime, its complicit in the government, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not just being killed by gangs of drug traffickers; they are doing so on the orders of politicians and security services who are in conjunction with organized crime.
The Committee on the Protection of the Press, Article 19, believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out on the orders of the police and government officials.
“In Mexico, you’re dying because they want to shut you down,” Ramirez said.
Of course, murder scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body was found a note supposedly written by the face of the Zetas cartel: “I’m here because of my articles.”
The computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her cut-off head.
Some publications preferred to close as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslav Brich was murdered in March.
Others continue to stand as "El Maníana" from Nuevo Laredo after her manager was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home state or country at all.
It's a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find a job, and they are still looking at the danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as was apparently the case with photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work are balanced daily between risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he is afraid to write about drug trafficking.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a journalist,” he said.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last edition was already ready to be printed, Riodos publishers were sitting on the sidewalk next to the office drinking beer when their phones suddenly ringed at the same time.
A series of shootings between opposing gangs and security forces near the resort town of Massatlan left 19 bodies, according to confirmed data.
The war continued to erupt, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news via a mobile phone on the Riodose website.
The next day, I had to rewrite the first page.
Nearby the sirens were blown - another shot in the vicinity.
Bohorkes looked at whether the police guards were ready to defend them.
If they were frightened, they did not show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the whole of Sinaloa, the Riodose employees continued his case.
"How can you think of closing," Bohorkes said, "if the same day that Javier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to report?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit awful.
The researchers said that the first remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhino discovered by a Canadian miner survived so well that experts called it "My Lyse Among Dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they could even determine that the color of his peeling skin was reddish-brown – and say that he had, in some way, a “dark past.”
The report, published in the journal Contemporary Biology, described it as "the best preserved of Tyreofor in the history of findings and one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
This fossil is a recently discovered specimen of a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of a small period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly good condition stunned the researchers, who call him “really amazing.”
This herbaceous thyreophor is the best preserved fossil of this species in the history of findings, according to articles in National Geographic.
He was found by Sean Fanck when he was working at Sankor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He encountered something that seemed to be different from the surrounding race, and decided to look more closely.
The fossils he discovered were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was carried out to detect an animal within the earth’s depth of 2,500 pounds (1,100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
“It’s worth a little bit of getting up, and it’s almost possible to believe he’s asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology, where the creation is demonstrated.
"He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaurs - Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
Studying his skin, the researchers found that it was herbal, although it was covered in pancircle and resembled a walking tank, apparently was exposed to significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful pancircle-covered dinosaur used red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as protective paint, which is also used by many animals today.
This would allow him to merge with the environment faster and avoid meeting enemies, experts say, suggesting that he was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This 110 million-year-old creature, belonging to the nodosaurus family, was widely illuminated in the press in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and given it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the museum laboratory worker Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours behind his excavation.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the drawing and shape of scissors and pancakes on his body.
They discovered a protective color, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although the protective color is well-spread, the discovery has become a surprise because the size of the Borealopella dinosaur significantly exceeds the size of the now living animals with a protective color.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred the masking of confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern protective-colored animals – for example, ostriches, zebras or armored bears – are considerably smaller and are more affordable mining, which indicates that nodosaurus had to fight seriously for survival.
“The serious threat from predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur-covered pancier shows how dangerous the Mel period predatory dinosaurs were,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur’s cough also indicates that his skin should have been reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the preserved contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was carried into the sea, where it drowned and flew down to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Albert was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to spread far deeper into land than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with the preserving skin, and at the same time completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original form of the animal," Brown said.
As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked then, in the Early Mel period.
You don’t have to resort to imagination in order to recreate it, it’s only worth getting a little tight, and you can almost believe that he’s sleeping.”
A melting period is an era when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, roamed around the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the rex tyrannosaurus, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of its terrible ancestors could hunt for thyreophoresis.
These include the acrocantosaurus, a monster of 38 feet (11.5 meters) in length, weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Modern Biology, believe that Borealopella was taken into the sea after his death and mummified in the island.
The creature was found by Sean Fang when he was working on a Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum’s staff, it is the best-preserved thyreophore in the world, along with skin and pancircle, and it targets from the face to the hips.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic characteristic were two twenty-inch sticks that emerged from their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbal thyreophor has been hard on the fact that it is now Canada until the melting river brought it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his armor with precision to the smallest detail.
The rocky remains of this particular specimen have been so well preserved that the skin remains still cover the buggy panser plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Mikhail Greshko wrote in an article for National Geographic, such a degree of survival is “rare as winning a lottery.”
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The stone remains of the skin are still covered by buggy pantry plates, sowing the animal’s skull.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it are folded upwards.
I can count the skulls on his sole.”
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who had previously led Georgia and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did so without any documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
Saakashvili’s arrival is reported by the Polish edition of Televizja Republika, which posted on its YouTube channel a video with his performance.
Saakashvili performed at the event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw uprising against Hitler troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not speak Polish, although he tried to start speaking the language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, politicians touched on the topics of Georgia’s cooperation with Poland, as well as speaking about Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service of Ukraine lost his citizenship, the opposing politician learned while in the United States.
How did he manage to make a transatlantic flight without documents, yet unknown.
Earlier, former governor of Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining Ukrainian citizenship was falsified.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
Investigation period in the case of Weinziher and Olhovik extended until January
The period of preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the group of companies "Renova" Evgeny Olhovik and head of energy holding "T Plus" Boris Weinziher has been extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmann court is considering the extension of the accused's home arrest.
The representative of the SC informed at the meeting of the decision to extend the period of preliminary investigation for the last time.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and carry out the examination of a large number of documents, as well as the conduct of investigative actions in the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly sworn in to the Comi leadership.
Their total size is estimated to be at least one billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinsicher, Olkhovik, as well as the former head of the company "Complex Energy Systems" Mikhail Slobodin, who, until September 5, led the company "Vympelkom", were also responsible for the creation of the Vympelkom and the <0xD0><0xBF><0xD0><0xBE><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xB4><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB5> <0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xBC><0xD0><0xBC><0xD0><0xBC><0xD0><0xBC><0xD0><0xBC><0xD0><0xBC> to the senior officials of the Republic.
Weinsicher and Olkhovik were arrested, staged in Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin hiding from the investigation and was announced in federal search.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question “Whose streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the depths of her soul.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, St. Louis’s native was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented via Airbnb, watching a Facebook tape on her phone.
She was pushed to the post by someone from high school.
“The police just killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and he’s still in the middle of the street.”
Noting that no one else in her ribbon had posted this information, she was confused, she closed her Facebook page and opened her Twitter account.
It had a lot of user posts with <0x40>TheePharoah.
A real-time rapper from Greater St. Louis tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black teenager killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown’s lifeless body, spread out among the streets where it will be located for four hours.
“It’s wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was not something new for her and her circle.
She postponed the phone, and later in the evening returned to tweets about people coming to Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of a signal tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown’s father, holding a poster saying, “A Ferguson policeman just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a lazy dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, raised a gun and said, “I’ll kill you all... animals!”
“It’s a non-standard situation,” Ferrell said in her own memories.
“It’s not a murder like the ones we’re used to and which we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt a swelling.
I was angry and crying.”
She took a ticket for the return flight and flew home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years became the theme of the new documentary “Whose Streets?”, which will be released on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, strength and persistence from the point of view of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrell was driving to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower dress and under-coloured wristband, they remembered a conversation that had led to this morning countless times, "about the experience of the blacks and their position."
She remembers how she said, “Remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We’re going to Ferguson now because the policeman killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and that was wrong.”
“I couldn’t take her,” Ferrell said later.
“What’s happening today is the culmination of what’s happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it and be educated on it.
It should not only understand well in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black people’s experience and their status and what we must do to become free to be free.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she herself does not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I'd do her a bad favor if I'd fenced her out of it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made their first stop on South Florida Road, on a pitch across the road from a police station, which became like a tent camp, while the activists awaited reports of the officer's innocence.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined a local businessman who prepared lunch packages.
They collected the packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
A little in the mind of Ferrell took the form of a new type of activism.
"My activism has completely changed since August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Health Students, representatives of national minorities, and engaged in food equity and health inequality.
“I didn’t have the experience of an organiser.
It came on its own.”
A few weeks later, in the evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Folyan, one of her co-directors.
Folyan said she and her chief operating officer Lucas Alvarado-Ferrar "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrell came to his mind with the question, “Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story that can be played on?”
This skepticism was engulfed by numerous people, often white, who came to the community in order to take advantage of its pain and endurance.
“We’ve heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson don’t get the focus, and we wanted to do it differently.”
By that time, Foleyan had already merged with his co-director, Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on the issues of those sentenced to death.
His involvement aroused sympathy for the project at Ferrell and six other locals, with whom the team of the Whose Streets Project had been in touch for years after Brown’s murder.
“In this documentary, no one is talking for us or with us, that’s what we’re talking about,” Davis said.
“It was the most important thing for me how these people will be represented, because that’s how I will be represented myself.”
And while the goal of the project was not to focus at all on Ferrell’s experience – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the rescuer leader, but about how the community unites,” Folyan said, it turned out to be the most open part of the film.
As a result, Ferrell’s “Whose Streets?” shows unexpected personal aspects of her life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said, laughing about how she first saw the finished product.
“But I understood that when you do this job and humanize black people, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story once again discusses and emphasizes the role of black gay women in the wider context of the “Life of Blacks Matters” movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – those who created the <0x23>BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after the murder of black teen Trayvon Martin in 2012 – classify themselves as homosexuals.
“Black gay women in leadership positions support all this movement,” Ferrell says, “and all because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
“Black gay women have to bear all this burden.”
Folyan agreed with this claim, noting that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of gay black women.”
However, she insists that “this is not a case of positive discrimination,” and that Ferrell was not selected as the film’s central character due to its distinctive features.
“She was the person who awakened this energy,” she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that it was in the foreground, because when"
You can feel her energy through the screen.”
In the meantime, Ferguson has not had a film camera for a long time, but there are still complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be on trial for another two-and-a-half years to close the road during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place, which it calls home, simply: "Bardak".
She's still holding on to the speech she learned when she went out on Ferguson's streets three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
Two El Salvadorian players disqualified for biting U.S. players
El Salvador team players Henry Romero and Darwin Serene have been long disqualified for their non-sportive behavior.
During the quarter-final game of the Confederations of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF) the El Salvadorans beat American players.
The first was defending Henry Romero.
The Salvadoran bite the attacker Josie Altidor, then stabbed him in the chest.
Then, Seren's half-defense, when he placed the corner in his penalty area, bit U.S. defender Omar Gonzales.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Seren for six.
The match itself ended with the Americans’ 2-0 victory, Goal.com reports.
Appearance of similarity: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of the Friedman Gallery in New York, the faces of people - white, black and brown, all inextricably similar to each other - hang from the ceiling on the wire.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from cheeks and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent cuts from Fort Levinworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst holds a 35-year term for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which covered August 2nd, is called "The Appearance of Similitude".
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and famous dissident, whose sentence was softened by Barack Obama just three days before the end of his presidency.
After analyzing using a computer program of DNA obtained from Manning, and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of faces that might be present in people with such a genome, Dewey-Harborg has created a deep, but not easy, intriguing, intriguing, intriguing, intriguing, and intriguing, intriguing intrigue.
Manning, who was born under the name Bradley Edward, but who, from a teenage age, said openly that she considers herself a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Spy Act, computer fraud, and theft.
Her photographs in prison were unavailable, so only one photo of her was known: a grainy black and white selfie, on which Manning in a platinum-shaped wig, clearly feeling uncomfortable, sitting behind the wheel of the car; with this photo, she and the assy became.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed her 2012 project, Visions of strangers.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people with the help of prosecution evidence of the type of stitches and chewing gum, extracting DNA from this garbage and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article,” Dewey-Hagborg explained in a preliminary presentation of the new press exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait made from her DNA.
In such an unusual way, the artist and her incarcerated muse became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote a comic book, "Depressed Images", illustrated by Shoeley Canungo, who depicted how in the future the president will ease Chelsea's punishment and be able to visit the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book was released turned out to be a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There’s something deep and strong in the fact that the exhibition opens right now as Donald Trump declares war on people disclosing secret information in the government, and invents new ways of sparking the enmity he’s sparking on Twitter.
When Dewey Harborg was asked about the coincidence of all of this over time, she said that "nothing happens by chance."
In the artist's statement, written on the wall of the gallery, the huge signature Manning below (with the heart instead of the "i" point in her name) calls for an end to "automatic separation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long crayon from pencils C, G and A.
Including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist sophisticatedly expresses), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how we all look amazingly similar, at least in its biological structure.
“I hope to explain to people that our genome doesn’t define who we are, how open the genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective it is,” said Dewey-Harborg, whose 2007 video “False Memories” is also displayed here.
“DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here.”
The last part of the exhibition that fits in one room is the above-mentioned novel in the comics.
On it, the King Kong-style Manning appears above the U.S. Correctional Chamber building with a speaker in hand.
“If they kill your speech, they will win,” it says.
“Never shut up, then.”
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says the artist, who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
“I still have ants on my skin when I talk about it.”
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person – as it was predictively portrayed in the comics – but when it comes, she will be greeted with masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulations, gathered like crowds of protesters.
This was also done intentionally, as was all at the exhibition up to the height (5"-2, the growth of Manning), on which the genetic haplogroups were drawn with a pencil.
“I would have hung them on the walls before, but now I want them to look like a crowd of people,” Dewey-Harborg said.
“I wanted them to resemble the mass movement that was formed around Chelsea, as the movement that stood behind its liberation.”
A Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staffer is searching for police on murder charges.
According to police, a national possession is going to a professor at the Northwest University and an Oxford University employee, who are being searched for as suspects in connection with the fact that a man was found trapped dead in a luxurious room in Chicago.
According to the court records of Cook County, orders were issued on Monday for deliberate murder without the right to release forty-two-year-old Windem Latham and fifty-six-year-old Gryunnette Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged murder.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after he was sustained multiple knee injuries.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department says the body was found on July 27.
Policemen received a call, they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and now detectives are investigating the death from knife wounds, deeming it a murder, while police are looking for two suspects.
Latham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of the Northwest since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbage, Vice President of the University of Communications, said in an emailed statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was banned from entering the Northwestern University campus.
“This is now a criminal case that is being investigated by authorized persons, and the North-West University is cooperating with the investigation,” Kabaj said.
Warren is a senior staff member of the financial institutions of the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: “We have spoken to the UK police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigative authorities.”
The statement also said Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
Chicago Police Chief of Communications Anthony Gullemy said he strongly advised the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have speculations about their location, but our attempts to find them are intensifying,” Gullemmi said.
According to Gülhelmi, local, regional and federal authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
According to Gülmey, the policeman was called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in number 1008.
Police have called the crime scene awful.
Gülemmi said it was unclear whether the incident itself occurred on July 27.
According to him, the data from the video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were in a relationship,” Gullemmi said.
The Grand Plaza Directorate issued an appeal to the defendants, stating: “At the moment, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the VADA roadmap in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) set for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be met in the near future.
“A certain stage in fulfilling the requirements has been passed, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and conduct tests together with the UKAD (UK Antidoping Agency).
The VADA roadmap was updated accordingly,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap for the Restoration of Compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of the work of RUSADA and was recently published on the website of this organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian andidoping structures should publicly acknowledge the results of an investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McClaren, who claimed that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
On this issue, Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures were taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not acknowledge what was not.”
Mutko repeated the words of Vitali Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
The same morning, in an interview with the Russian edition of "Rsport", Smirnov acknowledged the problems that had occurred in the Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
Unconditionally no one is going to accept this report,” Smirnov added.
VADA removed RUSADA from the doping control in November 2015 after the doping scandal.
However, in June of this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After a visit to the Moscow office of the organization in July, the Director General of WADA Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to restore its work.
Fire in 79-story tower in Dubai
The fire, which took place in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, The Torch Tower, has been extinguished.
It is noted that the firefighters managed to cope with all the fires at 4.00 local time (3.00 msk).
Local authorities said no one was injured as a result of the incident.
At the time of the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed.
The reasons for what happened are not yet known.
Earlier it was reported that the 79-story residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world, is burning in Dubai.
All residents were evacuated in time.
Inconceivable costume of fans: pants that don't cover boots
The scandalous leading reality show "Dom-2" Olga Buzov struck the viewers of the Europa Plus Live festival with dances in panties.
In the eyes of thousands of fans, the newly appeared singer with a duet with Nastia Kudri performed the song "We will be hot".
Both girls went on stage in provocative "brooks", sewn in such a way that the singer's underwear meant.
Buzova and Kudry were printed on the pants.
Earlier it was reported that the changes in the appearance of Buzova commented by a specialist of one of Moscow clinics of plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg acknowledges deterioration in relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, August 4, by the news service "Radio 4" with reference to foreign media.
According to him, it is the Russian authorities who are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, the NATO secretary-general also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine”.
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia, however, is possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said U.S.-Russia relations were at a dangerously low level, accusing the U.S. Congress of doing so.
Yekaterinburg Metro is taking on a new payment method
In October, the trip to the Ekaterinburg metro will be possible to pay with a bank card, said the CEO of I-Net Ltd. Pavel Vedernikov in an interview with Oblastna Gazet.
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 World Cup the same metro payment system as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
“We want fans from other countries, guests of the world, to be able to use the metro with their bank cards, without buying tokens and standing in a row,” he said.
Startups that will help your company not become the next “Uber”
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among the employees of her e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often floating, useless, or, worse, dishonest.
And even though she had promised anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
“He’s never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, who runs a 75-person e-commerce company based in San Francisco, Madison Reed.
So she turned to third parties for help.
Now there is a new kind of startups in the field of work with staff that help companies find out how their employees feel.
By designing and licensing software, which is intended to measure employee involvement, they allow companies to make express inquiries, to address specific teams and demographic groups, to provide anonymity and a hot line of complaints to the employees.
“We now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Glint’s Redwood City startup, whose analytics programs are used by companies to measure engagement.
Errett said she had a better understanding of what her employees think and feel after three years of using Glint.
In addition to the express surveys and surveys of certain teams, the product offers a thermal map of the company and shows in a visual way which units have more complaints and which managers have a low rating of approval, allowing it to understand why.
Companies are a little aware that they need to control the workplace situation, otherwise they will become another "Uber", which turned out to be involved in the scandal, when a former employee posted a post in a blog in which he did not describe the aggressive situation, in which he did not.
For startups like Glint, the desire to control the situation is an opportunity for a profitable business.
The internet portal “Let’s talk about payments” dedicated to financial technologies, the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could cost more than <0x24>118.7 billion by 2020.
The Denver, Colorado-based Convercent startup, which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year against the backdrop of a decline in Uber’s reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber appeared among customers.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send individually-ordered staff opinion polls, collect confidential responses in real time, and view thermal maps of problem zones.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messaging that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go straight to the direction.
“The court of public opinion has seized power from inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company treats employees badly or behaves unethically, even if the inspector does not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of customer boycotts, employee leaks and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant network with more than 500 establishments employing more than 25,000 employees, has used Convercent for more than a year to make sure employees are aware of the rules and procedures, and to offer an easy way to contact the company’s headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to search for a phone number or email from the head office, file an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, chief legal officer of Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company uses the Convercent service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay – can be quickly detected and handled.
“I can approach a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the employee’s situation,” said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
“And we are protecting our shareholders from court proceedings with employees.”
According to Queenland, the companies began to take more seriously the ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of the Enron Case.
But only when “social networks have become mass-proliferated” have the companies realized that they will not be able to keep their dirty underwear from spreading viral on the network.
“Before we started using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both "Glint" and "Convercent" offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that has been approved by venture investors who have supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received <0x24>10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, resulting in the company’s total capital of <0x24>47 million.
Glint received <0x24>10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, resulting in the company’s total capital of <0x24>60 million.
These investments are unlikely to be surprising given the interrelated nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than it used to be.
In markets with fierce competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is just the minimum necessary.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they dedicate their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in a company, they feel that they are heard, and that the work they do produces results, they are more trying to make such a company successful,” says Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits, Incent and Company Satisfaction.
Investors earn income when companies are doing well from their portfolio; companies are doing well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase the loyalty and involvement of employees, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to experts in workplace culture, it is important to have data on employee involvement.
But the data is useless until the company's guardians take action.
In fact, if the company asks employees for feedback, it can create the impression that changes are coming.
And if the changes do not come quickly enough, or do not come at all, disappointment may develop, and employees will lose interest.
“If you’re going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you should be ready to hold 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Ratt, president of consulting at Kotter International, a management firm that had to see companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t go to the end, the employees will think, ‘Did you really hear me?
You don't care?
If you don’t care, why shouldn’t I care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which is now conducting monthly employee surveys, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports the problem with Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees dissatisfied with the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long run, this knowledge will help it to more effectively retain employees in an industry known for its high current staff.
“If you don’t try to create a culture of transparency, you lose people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
If you lose customers, you lose your company.
New asphalt opened in Barnaul on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue
In Barnaul, significant measures were taken to eliminate the cause of asphalt failures on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue.
The place where two holes emerged on the recently paved passage (crossing with Youth Street) was decided to "open".
We recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tramways was due to the fact that the land was inhabited in the area of the homeless unexploited network.
According to Ivan Garmat, Deputy Chairman of the City Committee on Roads, Construction, Transport and Communications, a detailed investigation will be carried out for a detailed examination and elimination of the preconditions for the collapse.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that the refurbishment of homeless communications and their concreteization will be required.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins team has to work longer because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled training twice a day.
Time is approaching eleven o’clock; a crowd of footballers from the University of California in Los Angeles is delayed to chat on the one side of the team’s new training fields located on the campus.
Some of them put down their shirts, barely covering their backs, shiny from sweat after the tense first day of the sports camp.
For many players, these minutes of break are a break in the middle of the day.
The players registered for the summer classes, after a three-hour training, will go back to the dormitories to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning will return to the Vasserman football centre for the meeting at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday became Tuesday, team coach Jim Mora said: “The next three days, these guys are waiting for a meatball.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the burden on players, actually extended their working day – at least until the exams were completed on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three training sessions of the California University team in Los Angeles was set at 7:15 p.m. to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
The side effect of the absence of two workouts a day has been the increased number of days with one workout, and Bruins moves the start of the camp almost a week compared to last year and conducts training during the summer school for the first time in six seasons in Mora.
According to the schedule, they will have 18 training sessions until August 20, including before starting official preparations for the first game of the season against the A&M team at Texas University in September.
Mora said he supports the change of rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that he has added another item to the tight schedule of players.
“For three or four days, we’re giving them this enormous burden, it’s a serious test,” Mora said.
“And they just beat him, they’re working, they’re great guys.
I think when we live up to Saturday and have more time, it will be really great.”
When the camp ends, the University of California in Los Angeles will make the trainings closed; this is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct visibility with the adjoining parking lot and from the neighboring "Laskin-center", which is more expensive than that.
Players from Bruins are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will have security,” Mora said.
“It’s a serious problem, and I’m not exaggerating the danger, assuming that someone can take a room, sit there, and record a training video.
If you have a video of your workout, it’s very serious.
But we'll have security there and there'll be security in parking lot number 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg have been discharged from hospitals
All victims of the terrorist attack on the St. Petersburg subway in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of Deputy Governor Anna Mityanina.
According to the data at the end of July, there were three people in the stations, reports the TV Center.
The explosion in St. Petersburg’s metro station broke out on April 3 of this year.
The bomb was exploded by the terrorist-murderer Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the terrorist attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the executioner himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including alleged organizer Abor Azimov, were arrested.
On the eve, Rospotrebnadzor recommended that the St. Petersburg metropolitan to revise the plan of transport security measures, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook boosts fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will be more likely to send suspicious texts to independent experts and display their findings under original posts, the world’s largest social network said on Thursday, which is trying to combat so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company said it is starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible mystifications, send them for verification, and possibly show the results of fact-checking under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news, which many believe has influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
This issue is also actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by fake news before the presidential election in May, and in Germany before the September elections, the supporters of the plan were not saying they would be fining social networks if they did not.
In a separate German-language statement on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was testing a new fact-checking algorithm that was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing what messages are being challenged by independent verifiers, people want to have a broader context to make sound judgments about what they’re reading and what they’re sharing,” said Sarah Sue, Facebook’s news ribbon manager.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the “linked articles” feature and work on other changes in the news bar to solve the fake news issue.
Create a comic book: A castle in English history
In the recent past, the tiny castle of Scotty was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 70s and 80s served as a harbour for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy place in the Built River Valley in Kent County, he watched the stormy history around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with a shady hair and a tendency to historical documents, to a comic book.
“I think it’s so beautiful to look at the character of a man who died 300 years ago,” he says with enthusiasm.
“You feel it so personal when you hold this letter in your hand.”
"The Castle in England" covers a period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells about families who lived in Scotland; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkevich, Bryony May Smith, Izzy Belli, and William Paxley.
This is not the first book by Rods, which is based on archival data: in 2014 he wrote "The Teeth of a Dead Man and Other Stories" - a collection of documents from the British Library; this project unexpectedly brought him to the depths of his soul.
“I could have just strangled a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working on Jacobites,” he says.
"It's his fingerprint."
And the letters always smell of smoke, because in those times the lighting was lit.
And in 300 years, in the future, you think you're there too.
Oh, how I love the archives!"
For a person so passionate about old papers, getting support from the National Foundation and the English Art Council and living in a castle for four months ("Honestly, I've been there a little bit") seems too good to be true.
Rods studied the "new" Victorian castle for days, went through the archives and looked at numerous treasures of property and ancient things - for example, heads of hyenas on walls or bottles, centuries lying in the back.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to foresters, gardeners and sometimes artists working on illustrations for his book.
Then at night he “drank whiskey and sat down to write.”
The history of Scotty Castle has not been studied much since the National Fund received full access to it only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassi, died.
When Rods arrived ten years later, the staff only began to deal with the archive, which he describes as "what the aristocrats had fallen to the ground for centuries."
The diaries, the letters of the British Empire's times, the maps showing who owned something: "You think the land disputes are boring," says Rods, "but two families fought for this pond.
“That’s right, guys!”
In some stories the castle collection becomes the starting point for broader quests in English history: for example, in the Worker's, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
"There is information about the uprising that took place at the castle in 1380, in a book called The Knights of Kent and Sussex," Rods said.
“The peasant uprising started in these places, and I thought the uprising was a good start.
Maybe they were connected?”
Other plots are closely related to the history of the castle - for example, "The Priest", which tells the story of a Jesuit priest whom the Darrel family had been hiding for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Contrabandist", about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrel, who is believed to have staged his own funerals by stamping the tomb with stones (this was discovered several years later when the tomb was excavated).
Darrell is the beloved Rods family of all Scots people: "The gentlemen seem to have been a perfect villain, always indebted and spent money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their problems with debts, marrying rich older women – I imagine them as a company of cute guys who can take care of the heirs of big fortunes.”
Upon completion of his work at the castle, Rods seeks other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish deafness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Eliyamayaki - a place where at the beginning of the twentieth century there was a sanatorium, and then it grew again in the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
“It was sad to leave,” he says.
“I felt like this: damn it, I have to go back to real life again.”
Fifteen of the largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alpha-bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank and FC "Opening", another seven credit institutions are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, at least 80 per cent of the market will be accounted for by organizations exiting the ARB.
But this is not just a way out - all the banks that have declared a break with the ARB, are negotiating with another public organization, which unites credit institutions, - the Association of regional banks "Russia", which is led by a well-known politician, Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the Finance Committee.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was set during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, suggesting a new classification of banks according to the size of the statutory capital.
At the time, Garegin Tosunyan, the president of the ARB, said that according to the association, the bill is being passed in the interests of the largest banks, which are thus trying to limit the possibilities of small and medium banks in the regions, interfering with their clientele.
Among other complaints was criticism of the Central Bank, which, in Tosunyan’s opinion, does not always justify the withdrawal of licenses from some banks, which, indeed, was followed by an objection from the representative of the central bank: many of the leaders of the banks that were smuggled, in particular,
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions is very sensitive to the relationship with the chief regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, stating disagreement with the policy of the banking industry, have begun to prepare for the admission to the association.
Investors will be better.
What's the deal going to end?
Let us immediately answer the main question that arises with the slightest failure or conflict in or near the banking sphere: investors will not be threatened by anything, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Headed by "Russia" Anatoly Aksakov, known for his versatility in everything regarding the interests of banks and their customers, a high-level professional, who is highly appreciated in the Central Bank: almost all the directors of the central bank are well-informed.
In the staff and organisational plan, obviously, no special shocks are also foreseen.
Undoubtedly, the ARB is in a difficult financial and management situation after the loss of such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest, established in 1991, organization that defends the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the area of monetary and credit processing as a whole.
It cannot be said that even in the association "Russia" banks with extended arms are ready to accept new members under any conditions, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("maybe, too much is a good idea").
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiating process is now under way, the proposals of both sides are being considered, and the agenda of the special meeting of the association is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of the international banking forum.
We'll figure it out.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "the chair is not held", named a possible new head of the updated association "Russia" Georgiy Luntovsky, who leaves the post of Vice President of the Central Bank in September.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now resting in the Crimea, plans to pause for one day and arrive in Moscow, for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of Association "Russia", where it is intended to consider the agenda of the extraordinary congress "Russia".
Entrance of gasoline-powered cars to major cities of Russia will not be limited
Deputy Head of Foreign Affairs Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of gasoline-powered cars into Russia’s major cities will not yet be restricted.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually increase the environmental class.
And there's the concept of immediately switching to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for that.
The question is: from what year?
That’s the slogan of the phrase – let’s ban it.
Where and when?
-Tomorrow?
Will the whole city be closed?
“In 20 years, I don’t know, maybe it will happen,” Prime Minister said.
Earlier, the newspaper "Izvestia" reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study proposals on possible options of state support for electric transport, presented to the government by the Director General of PAO KamAZ Sergei Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of vehicles with DVS in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for obtaining a green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump has said that a new U.S. immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining a green card will change.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so in the light of changes in how the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who own the English language, have the money resources that allow them to retain themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said in a statement.
The appearance of sex robots is real, and that should worry us
We did not manage to think that 2017 could no longer be worse, a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots was released.
- Yeah.
Sex robots are now at the center of attention.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
In the opinion of Noel Sharki, deserving Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must take their emergence seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the eyes of robots, the shape of the claws and the type of nails.
“People are hilarious about this, but companies are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we will see much more of them,” Sharki said in a presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable comrades to robots with silicone leather, warm to the senses, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "customize" their robots to their taste, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the shape of the robot's claws to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a “personality” compared to which the Stepford Woman would seem very progressive is even more worrying.
Modern sex dolls have turned into silicone leather robots.
For example, the company "RealBotix robot" allows users to customize in robots the quality they find attractive – for example, shyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by "True Companion", which come with already programmed personality - for example, "Cold Farra" makes an impression of shy, and "Dicky Wendy" has a "court" character.
“Roxxxy Gold has a character that suits you perfectly,” the True Companion website said.
That’s why she loves what you love, doesn’t like what you don’t like, and so on.
She changes her mood over the course of the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she may “be in the mood”!”
In the emergence of sex-robots, there is a lot of concern – not least because they replace real human relationships – but the most worrying is the subordinate image of a woman, an association with the rape that is caused by the (obsession).
On the site "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared with a vibrator, only for men.
“If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can’t men have a Roxxxy?”
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicates something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not stupid or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It is not a coincidence that these complex sex robots emerged precisely when women’s rights around the world were under threat, when there is a president in the White House who boasts that he is approaching women.
The scariest thing in the TV series "Story of the maid" is not graphic images, twisted bodies and oppressed eyes, but just how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it does not seem so big.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve such a physical resemblance to real women (only with proportions of pornstars), as technology allows.
Their creators want them to seem like people to sense to copy the movements of the human body.
But their “character” robots are not like real women.
They can’t break up with their partners or leave them.
They have neither their life nor their biography—nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, the maids.
The native of Los Angeles, Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, who has been running for Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which will start on August 31.
This was reported in an interview with the portal BeBasket, general manager of "blue-yellow" Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately, he won't come by family circumstances.
"We're going to the Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will give opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
I remind you: with the direct participation of Jeter, the team of Ukraine took the record sixth place for itself at Eurobasket 2013 and for the first time reached the World Basketball Championship, in which the "yellow-blue" case was not able to overcome the group stage 4, under 5 in the U.S.
Jeter has ceased to play for the Ukrainian team since he left the position of head coach of our American national team, Mike Fratello, who left the position in 2015.
The men’s Eurobasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold their group tournament matches on the promised land.
Evgeny Murzin has five matches in Group B: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our men’s team conducted two control matches, in which they surrendered to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's big hit?
Images of Mitt Romney seem to be very reasonable
In Trump’s era, the commonplace was the fact that political controversies that polarized the American electorate broke some families at the micro-level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, U.S. newspapers sparked columns about how to deal with terrible relatives voting for Trump.
Looks like we're all so tense that we're going to explode soon.
We talk less about Trump’s ability to connect families.
I am writing about this because my cousin, a left-wing poet from Chicago, who had long been on knives with Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity in the fight against the common enemy can have a strong effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother she’s been arguing with about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely came to one side.
It’s certainly good for dinner, but I can’t help thinking that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has instilled power in the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will stop beating his way out.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the right-wing Republicans, who will suddenly show up as an example of common sense against the backdrop of his standards.
I realized that I miss the old-fashioned madness of Mitt Romney today - with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looked like) - compared to Trump and the rest.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will have enough to be in his mind to see a huge step forward in him.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to the Central Park carousel – the largest carousel in the New York State Department’s parks and the best way to spend <0x24>3 in the city if you don’t need caffeine.
Horses are ugly and huge, pictures of fiberglass on the central drum - make-up clowns and animals, who, bending, in terror, look at their backs - extremely captivating, and the whispering music, as strangely as it may be, leads to war.
So many well-known things in this city are disappointing: views from skyscrapers become obsolete, the silhouettes of buildings are too much to cause trembling, and the reality of the city does not succeed in a dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I am still experiencing the day when I learned that the Suiss Cottage area is not really a Swiss shale (the thematic pub "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" is not included), but a large circular crossroads in North London.
A carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old, an eleven-year-old and two women in their 40s can have a great time.
If I could give the carousel a rating, I would give it five, but, fortunately, no one asked me for it.
And in the studio this week I was asked before how to carry a card on the terminal, to evaluate my "experience" of purchases on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street the same plus the option to accompany the tea assessment at 15 percent is for order at the stand.
As a result, not only is the neutral idea of interaction slowing down, but it is also necessary to introduce a personal attitude to a situation that does not imply it.
The poor saleswoman at the universemagazine smiled confoundedly while I was tired of assessing my experience of handing her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
Pistorius is leaving prison for his second visit to the doctor.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of wrist cuts, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of falling in the chamber.
Pistorius was convicted of deliberate murder after the prosecutor's appeal for an initial conviction for unintentional murder.
He killed Steencamp early on Valentine’s Day in 2013, shooting at him several times through the toilet door of his Pretoria home.
Pistorius said he accepted his girlfriend as a night thief hiding in his toilet.
The prosecutor’s office said it intends to file another protest, this time against Pretorius’ six-year term, which she said was too soft.
The Prosecutor General's Office said that the appeal would be brought before the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be considered this year.
The term of the Pretorium may be increased by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect in strike of journalist NTV selected subscription on non-exit
The capital's law enforcement officers chose a measure of restraint in the form of a non-exit subscription for the man who attacked the journalist of the NTV channel Nikita Razhozhayev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
"In the framework of the investigation of a criminal case initiated under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (“Poboy”) against a 32-year-old man who hit the face of a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of Culture and Rest - the mention of the name Gorky was written, and the suspect was chosen by the measure.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that the suspect had been drafted an administrative protocol for police disobedience.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during a live broadcast on VDV Day, a ruthless man approached the correspondent and hit his face.
As it turned out later, the hooligan has nothing to do with VTV.
According to Rozhozhayev himself, the landers, on the contrary, tried to detain Moscow.
Two Bulgarians Detained in Greece for Illegal Parking
According to the BBC TV channel, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal parking.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people were detained in Sitonia, setting tents in an uninhabited location, including two Bulgarian citizens.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to the TV channel "Bi Ti-Vi" that Bulgarian citizens were subsequently released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camping and are already imposing severe fines on anyone caught while parking in a place not intended for this.
The checks will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Russia's Foreign Ministry Accused Vice President of the United States in the Rhetoric of the Cold War
Statements made during the European tour by Vice President of the United States Michael Pence have been criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
“It is regrettable to note that Washington is increasingly leaning towards primitive ideologicalized stamps of the Cold War era, which are completely detached from reality,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Thus, the Foreign Ministry reacted to Penz’s words about the “Russian threat” and the attempts to violently cover the borders told him in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice "either with the West or with Russia" and the vagueness of the thesis about the allegedly non-alternative entry of the whole of South-East Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also reminded that it was the United States that violated international law by applying force to renounce Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another focal point of tension.
“We call on our American colleagues to stop the shelling of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is consistently based on respect for partners and readiness to work together constructively, on mutual consideration of interests,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Fieldsher injured in a car accident with "soon" in Podmoskiv
The accident occurred in the sub-Moscow Stupino, as a result of the collision of the inomar with the cart "Emergency" suffered the fieldsher.
Today at about 08:10 <0xD0><0x9C><0xD1><0x83><0xD0><0xBA> occurred a collision of Mitsubishi car with an ambulance wagon in the city of Stupino Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the machine "soon" turned around," - TASS said in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Moscow region.
At the scene of the accident, law enforcement officers work, the circumstances of the incident are clarified.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son into a cellophane pack.
On the evening of August 3, the Divisional Police Department received a message from the local resident that he had found a package with the baby in an unfurnished private house.
"On the scene of the accident, law enforcement officers and doctors went out, who promptly delivered the child to a medical facility," the Odessa National Police chief said.
The doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before he was discovered, as evidenced by the presence of a pub.
During the priority operational and follow-up activities established the identity of the native - a 36-year-old local resident.
It has also been found that the woman has three other minor children.
As noted in the chapter, in the field of view of law enforcement, the family did not fall before and did not take special care.
At present, the circumstances and reasons that have offered the woman to do so are identified by the police, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under the supervision of doctors.
As reported earlier, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her unborn child into the garbage dump.
Grigory Leps: "I'm in a fight, 55 is not 30"
One of the most successful artists of Russian estradiation, Gregory Leps will celebrate his 55th birthday on Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer talked to the spectator "Izvestia".
I remember how your "co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co-
A special tent in "Lu<0xC5><0xBE>niks", Gloria Gaynor sang for the name man, a powerful greeting over the Moscow River.
You must have been hanging out then, like you'd like to spend your next five years.
Plans come to fruition?
Speaking of profession, it was a good time.
I worked hard, I toured the country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
I have released two great albums.
Of course, I'm not what I was, say, 20 years ago.
Biological watches should not be deceiving.
Singing like I sang at 30 is getting harder.
Still, I'm in a fight, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
With them you're recording a new album, the first in three years.
Yeah, he's working on it right now.
Actually, we've already recorded it all in my studio and now we're going to send it for a visit to Los Angeles.
It's called "Why Are You So Serious?" from a song of the same name that was co-written with Timati.
It's not ready yet, so we haven't put it anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we get the clip on it.
And the album will be presented in November - to a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow "Crocus City Hall".
Your new record has been hand-in-handed by classic American drummer Chris Coleman.
Do you think you wanted him to join your tour team?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to my studio, recorded his parties.
I offered him to join my band, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, in a gentle way, excessive conditions.
It was about fees from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35,000 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,000 per month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space I would also be looking for decent musicians.
And I found the great drummer Max Malyshev.
It is better to feed them (smile).
Sometimes I want to get in touch with someone, not for anything.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly rated internationally.
About him is written by Western music magazines, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wei, listening to his play, said that "a new generation of guitarists came with another performing technique."
Your album's down in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you can't come to the U.S. yourself?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Now, to be honest, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry I can't get to America.
I've said many times that I'm studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful.
We don't fool them, but we don't have that experience, school.
In front of our popular music performers for 70 years, the challenges that American musicians have always faced have not been quite the same.
They aimed at the highest quality sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has refused me to enter for ten years.
But I will still apply for visas to the British Embassy every year to allow me to travel there again, and most importantly, to work there.
The rest of Europe has a positive attitude towards me.
And already in August you have a concert in Monaco, not an order, but a poster, right?
Yeah, there's a good sports room in Monte Carlo, and I've been there before.
Now they are invited again, and as far as I know, all tickets for the concert have already been sold out.
You want to go to Randeva Lyma Vikule, which will begin on July 20 in Jurmala?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lyma is a wonderful singer and a wonderful woman, able to present herself with a beautiful voice, and even a whisper.
After tours and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be completely different.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky in about the same presentation as he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
There's no other arrangement.
I will be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to participate in the album and Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about this, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy person, so let's see how it goes.
You and the songs of Boris Grebenschykov gradually entered your repertoire.
Maybe you'll write his stuff on the album later?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a wonderful musician.
I crossed with him several times and asked, “Can I sing one of his songs?”
He said, "Grigory, I'm writing songs so they can be performed."
Please, try it, sing it.
It’s interesting to write such an album.
I don’t have such a task yet, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn’t mind, I might make such a project.
Unless you are fully focused on the affairs of your production center.
I guess until you realised his potential, didn't you sign contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers that I would have dreamed of having under my wing, but they are independent, held people.
You mean Sergei Lazarev?
Serija is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may not agree with anything with his repertoire, but he is a professional and has his own development strategy.
And now in my center is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in the Voice.
We signed a contract and worked with him.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be a shame if he does not reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, I'm taking the clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, I cry to poets, sometimes their tracks fall in the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
At the release they will get a recorded album, a few clips.
And further, if they wish, they can go their way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I would be pleased if any of them succeeded commercially and paid me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to cover up oxygen for anyone.
Let everyone work, punch, prove, as I once proved.
If tomorrow you are offered to take a tour of Ukraine and guarantee entry into the country, will you go?
I'm still being invited there.
It is mainly about closed-ended activities.
As for the big tour...
I am a man of my own country, a Russian, who, in his own opinion, flew to Syria on the same plane that later crashed.
If tomorrow they say that we need to fly to another point in the interest of the state, I will take a break.
I don’t care what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I sincerely regret that such a situation has happened to us with Ukraine.
Because I believe that we are one people and must be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
They met like nowhere.
A very grateful audience.
He also collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik...
There are a lot of talented people in Ukraine, and it is sincerely a pity that they are now unable to fully pour out their talent to a broad Russian audience.
Music has to unite and entertain people.
I would love to invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, for example, Slavu Vakarchuk, and make a concert with him.
But at the moment, I think it's unlikely...
Andrea Ohlopkova transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known "<0xD0><0x95>", the technical director of the Eastern cosmodrome Andriy Ohlopkov started work at the State Space Science and Production Centre (HCNPC) named Khrunichev.
Previously, he de facto engaged in the construction of the Eastern cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the management of the Center for the Operation of Earth and Space Infrastructure (CENKI) was transferred to the enterprise in Moscow Filiy, where the co-ordination of the procedure is engaged.
Mr. Ohlopkov will not have an alternate: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished, and the functions are dispersed by the units of the CENKI.
About the fact that the technical director of Eastern and deputy director-general of CENKI for technological development Andriy Ohlopkov moved to work in the GKNPC named Khrunichev, "I" told the top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as difficult
“He’s been working on a new post for several weeks,” the industry’s “I” interviewees said.
CENKI’s immediate comment on Thursday failed, and Mr. Ohlopkov himself was unavailable for comments.
However, the information "<0xD0><0xB0>" was officially confirmed in the GKNPC.
He decided to move to the position of director for the coordination of production, - said at the company. - Andrei Ohlopkov presented him the task of ensuring a minimum of launch for the first launch on the Eastern submarine fully completed.
Mr. Ohlopkov moved to work at CENKI in 2013, serving behind the shoulders in the space forces, in particular in Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - on the "north" cosmodrome occupied the post of first deputy commander in the title of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Ohlopkov became a criminal figure.
The investigation accused him of robbery: allegedly, from his submission, regional merchants received state contracts for cancellation, but did not fulfill the commitments taken to clean separate parts of rocket carriers in the Archangel region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The responsibilities of the CENKI for technological development were applied to various projects, but the main of which was the construction of the spacecraft in the Far East.
The head of the then Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, in an interview with "I", clearly said that the situation in the East "was critical already in October 2013".
The fact is that the planning made a strategic mistake: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the carrier missile "Union-2.1" were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
To carry out the launch by the end of the year, the construction was decided to be completed six months earlier and the deadlines were moved from December to July 2015.
To accelerate the process, it was necessary to go to the trick: CENKI specialists began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment on unstructured facilities.
The main proponent of this idea was Andrei Ohlopkov.
Despite the risks that existed and the transfer still occurred (in place of December 2015, "Soyuz" flew only on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, says the source "<0xD0><0x95>" on the cosmodrome: "Otherwise, we would not have carried out a single launch.
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, curating the creation of the cosmodrome, in a joke called Andrei Ohlopkova his "space Susanin", but he almost always asked for information about the progress of the construction.
Did you remember Mr. Ohlopkov and the straight: for example, in an interview with "I" he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Specstroy) of the status of the only performer in the Eastern and directly working with the subcontractors?
This idea was supported by the government.
Since 2017, CENKI has assumed the responsibilities of the general contractor to complete the construction and installation work on the startup and technical complex to the planned launches in the fourth quarter.
According to "<0xD0><0x95>", the reason for Mr. Ohlopkov's transition to the new workplace became disagreements with the management of the CENKI on the methods of completion of the construction of the cosmodrome structures and complexes, as well as methods of work with subcontractors.
“It was decided that this would be better for everyone,” says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
An official of the government apparatus, in turn, called the decision strange: “He was one of the best specialists, finding an equivalent replacement for him will be difficult.”
According to the "Y", this will not be necessary: the position of the technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be distributed by the units of the CENKI.
In music schools there will be a curriculum for two specialties
In the future, children’s music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Svyatoslav Golubenko, for this, it is possible to read to the students repetitive disciplines, and the question with the payment of the other classes in the second specialty to be solved with the help of special grants.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken over this issue, and we will develop together with the expert community a mechanism that will allow us to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," - said Golubenko.
Last Friday, during the "Nedetic conversation" of Vladimir Putin with the educators of the children's center "Sirius", the student Maria Andreeva reported that she was forced to pay for repetitive items on the second specialty in the CMS at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she is studying violin and piano classes and has prizes contests in both directions.
The Head of State recognized her issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian detained on a wall in a skyscraper
In Mexico, the 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who fell on the roof of a tall building, reported the portal El Universal.
The incident took place in the capital of Mexico.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, passes through a three-metre fence into the territory of Nestle’s office building complex and takes himself to one of its towers.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
The young man was arrested on the roof.
Public security officials dropped him to the ground by helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
It will determine whether the young person is legally in the country.
In the meantime, video with a young man climbing high became popular on the Net.
Users called the young man a “spider man.”
As the media writes, such experiments are for him a hobby.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help ease CVD.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent studies say the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products can help alleviate symptoms in those who suffer from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable disease, which affects about 1.3 million people in the U.S. and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and swelling of the abdomen, chronic or blood cough, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to alleviate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid protein tryptophan contributes to the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Leading researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells in the intestine ensure that the harmful microbes coming from food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of initiating an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body and not damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too severely disrupted in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice with certain bacteria in their intestines appear to increase cell tolerance.
And this bacteria needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of the protein - to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a link between one type of bacteria — Lactobacillus reuteri — that is part of the normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan was contained in the diet of mice, the more these immune cells they had.”
He suggested that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan could contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to intestinal inflammation.
Postdoc Dr. Luiza Cervantes-Barraghanvas, studying the variety of immune cell-enhancing cells, found that one group of rats tested had these cells, and another group that belonged to the same line but contained them separately.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the microbiome of the gut of mice — the communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the gut cells of mice were sequencing, and six types of bacteria were found present in mice with immune cells, but absent in mice without them.
Mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells received L. reuteri, and immune cells appeared in them.
To understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of the liquid — free of bacteria — to underdeveloped immune cells secreted from mice.
Immune cells have turned into cells that increase tolerance.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the processing of tryptophan, known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice’s food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were reduced by two, the number of cells also dropped by two.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same cell-enhancing tolerance as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans as well as in mice, but in people suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, defects in tryptophan-related genes have been detected.
She says, “Maybe we need to strengthen the development of these cells, because inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may potentially lead to an increase in their population.”
According to Jose Mourinho, Manchester United hired “genius” in the face of Nemani Matich
Manchester United hired a genius in the face of Nemania Matich, according to José Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, bought for <0xC2><0xA3>40 million from Chelsea, started off with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last pre-season match of the United before the UEFA Super Cup match when the Real Madrid Super Bowl was played on Thursday and made an impression of the role.
However, since Matic did not take part in the pre-season Chelsea tour of Asia, he was seriously lacking in preparation for the game, and he only lasted 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires refinements before the start of the Premier League season.
“He takes time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in the way he thinks – he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him get ready sooner than later.”
Like Mati<0xC4><0x87>, his new co-stars Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began forming his base team at the start of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire first.
“I’m grateful to the club for getting three out of four,” he added.
“I’d be even happier if they hit me four out of four, but they’ve already tried a lot for me.”
Former social democrats of Lithuania agree to stay in the ruling coalition
Former presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former Prime Ministers Algirdas Butkyavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former social democrats speaker Cheslovas Yurshenas appealed to the co-partisans with a call to stay.
As the parliamentary newspaper reported, due to clashes with partners – the Union of Peasants and Greens – the Social Democratic Party has initiated a discussion about whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here are the three senior experienced comrades who turned to the one-party parties in an open letter, which, in particular, says: "The disappointment of the party comrade with the results of the elections, however, the coalition with the "peasants" has created for us a tendency that is not very easy, but still the conditions for that.
According to former party leaders, in the discussion so far, "there was an emotion-based expression of opinion without concrete arguments."
The authors of the letter fear that the unthinkable actions of their party may lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Anton Mamaeva Disabled is fined
Mosgorsud softened the sentence of disabled cyclist Anton Mamaev from four and a half years in prison to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
Earlier, by the decision of the Timiryazevsky Court, the convicted person was released from SIZO.
At the same time, Mosgorsud confirmed that the accused is a criminal, as he organized the robbery and kidnapping of a motorcycle wrestler from a former Special Forces fighter.
Mosgorsud with his decision softened the punishment of Anton Mamaev to 200,000 rubles.
"Mamaev is the organiser of the robbery, which also constitutes the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal accountability," - explained the press secretary of Mosgorsud Ulyana Solopova.
In this case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamaev, the factual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied article 64 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation, according to which a penalty can be imposed below the lower limit.
As for Mamaev’s assistant Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would be the reason for changing the category of severity of the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself said he was dissatisfied with the decision of Mosgorsud.
I'm disappointed by the court decision.
The only legitimate solution would be a justification, intended to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrei Orlov did not rule out appeals of the sentence in the Cassation Court of Mosgorsud and the Supreme Court.
“We will use all the levers until the European Court of Human Rights,” he told RIA Novosti.
The 28-year-old Moscovich Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscle atrophy, became a criminal figure in the fall of last year.
Disabled claims that he bought a motorcycle from relatives for 160 thousand rubles, to then sell.
However, the owners of the motorcycle, including a former special forces fighter, said that the disabled man and his assistant, Vasily Serostanov, had taken property from them, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Moscow district court sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in the colony, and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years in prison with the execution of the sentence in the colony of the general regime (according to Article 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation).
After the disabled person was placed in SIZO, the case was joined by the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General’s Office, commissioned for human rights under President Tatian Moskalkov.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from SIZO by the decision of the same court of Timiryasev.
Defence, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Mosgorsud.
UNF will prepare a report on ecology to the President
The final “Forum of Action” of the All-Russian People’s Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, the source at the UNF and confirmed the head of the movement Alexey Anisimov.
According to him, according to the results of the forum, "Frontowki" plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of domestic ecology, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
Izvestia’s interviews with the UNF noted that the report will contain a “deep analysis” of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final forum of the UNF will be held in the autumn.
The exact date of its implementation has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is adjusted to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present at the key events of the UNFPA.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirovo.
The final will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
Based on the proposals that have been made and will be made at these events, we will also form systemic proposals to solve environmental problems, - said Izvestiays interlocutor at the UNF.
The co-chair of the Central Headquarters of the Movement, Olga Timofeev, chairman of the State Duma Committee on Environmental and Environmental Protection, said that the “fronts” will inform the head of state about the work carried out within the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the UNFF’s “Action Forum” will most likely be combined.
For a year, we have grown up with a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental issues, seen gaps in legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be included in the report that we are preparing for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, "Frontowiki" is also reported on the work on the UNF priority projects, - told "Izvestia" Olga Timofeeva.
According to her, the forum will also be invited to the special representative of the Head of State for environmental activities, ecology and transport Sergei Ivanov.
Earlier he had already participated in the media forum of the UNF, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
Within a few months, the Year of Ecology will go into history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they can work for many years.
So that these issues do not fall off the agenda,” added Olga Timofeeva.
The head of the regional policy lab of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI) Andrey Kolyadin noted: raising the environmental issue, the UNF operates in the direction of the presidential agenda.
Many things they as experts offered in various forums, and these initiatives received the president’s support,” Andrey Kolyadin told Izvestia.
He stressed that, to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be excluded, which could give the regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the UNF, the regions will be able to promote not only the solution of their environmental problems, but also the development of ecotourism, - the expert added.
The relevance of the environmental theme was demonstrated by a “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the garbage landfill in Balashiya (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of the city of Nahodka (already a draft law on the prohibition of open coal transfer in settlements, one of the authors - Olga Timofeev).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole is created, the issue is in the further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the state, says Leonid Bochin, head of the charity "Ecology for All".
A member of the SPD, the head of the non-governmental organization "Greenpis of Russia" Sergey Tzyklinkov in a conversation with "Izvestia" stressed that to successfully solve environmental problems it is necessary to take a responsible approach of society and business, one legislative effort is little.
As soon as society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more profitable step in a strategic perspective, the situation will change, - noted Sergei Zipplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to break the trend that violation of environmental legislation is an economically advantageous solution for businesses.
A British inventor uses a microchip to get into a house and a machine to shake hands
The British inventor became the first person in the country to install a microchip so that he could open the door of his home, enter the office, and even drive the car with a simple hand blow.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam has experienced a tiny chip between his big and point fingers and now through his company BioTek offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives for the sake of technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist-consultant from the Royal University of Winchester, to ensure that the procedure was performed in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to the microchip that cats and dogs use, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also replaces locks in homes and cars for chip-compatible for <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
A married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his car "BMW Z4", which is powered when his hand is on the steering wheel.
The White House's record was worth thousands of dollars to taxpayers
According to records of the armed forces provided by TIME magazine, the White House’s decision last month to deploy a Marine helicopter to the South Lakes at an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers 24,000 dollars.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the "Marine One", when the president is on board, became a central element of the July 17 White House event demonstrating American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials have inspected tech products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, produced in Connecticut, was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Squadron of Marine Helicopters (HMX-1), the department responsible for the management of the helicopter, the Military Administration of the White House ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or "FRAGO" order, just 36 hours before the helicopter.
“I just wanted you to make sure you are aware of it because it’s an unusual event that is widely illuminated in the press,” the commander of the HMX-1 wrote in an email to his chief, the first deputy chief of the air force of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter stated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Strait at about 7 a.m. on 17 July to participate in the event scheduled for 3 a.m., and will remain there until the lawn will be released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with the restrictions on working hours.
The first crew escorted the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records received by TIME magazine, it remains unclear whether the second crew was eventually required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal officials from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event was not contrary to this decision.
“We asked, among other things, if it was a violation of Hatch’s law, and we were told that it was not,” the commander wrote.
“You don’t seem to have a place to go,” replied the deputy chief.
The event “Made in America” was declared by the White House as an official event, and the Hatch Act did not apply to it.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the president made efforts to promote the health reform, which was then being drafted in the Senate, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as "Marine One" and "Air Force One" for political purposes is unlikely to be a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travelling.
But asking them only for the sake of photography is unusual.
Trump was already the subject of discussions in February, when the presidential plane was flying in the background during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was shattered by messages with complaints about the use of the presidential plane ahead of his predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made in America' show, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers made of American materials," White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsey Walters said in a statement.
The HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington Agglomeration and on the South Pole to train the transport of the President of the United States to the White House with an accuracy of up to an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight performed for the event “Made in America” was calculated for the crew in the account of the necessary training flights for a month.
The unit’s helicopters also flew 11 additional hours on that day as part of “non-presidential support tasks”.
According to the White House, the taxpayers did not pay the expenses for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of the company "Sikorsky" said that the company did not participate in the organization of the demonstration of the helicopter on the South Lake.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the hourly rates of the Ministry of Defence for the fiscal year 2017, the VH-3D compensation rate for the Ministry of Defence is <0x24>24,380 per flight hour.
It is recorded in the records of the unit that the time of the aircraft in the air was 30 minutes in each direction from its base airport at the Quantico Marine Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than this rate.
“Calculating the cost for taxpayers on the basis of an approximate rate of reimbursement is completely wrong,” says Walters.
“These exemplary rates include personal composition, service, and many other irreversible costs that are included in annual allocations.”
According to a study conducted in 2015 by the REND Corporation, the rates of reimbursement do not include the cost of personnel, but, indeed, take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and expenses specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was in favour of using the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to showcase things done in America this week,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose workplace depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to create.
Therefore, of course, it is appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was unclear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter while inspecting the South Side during the event, but he was definitely sitting in the driver’s seat in the fire car.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, joking with the press about his own fleet of products of the company.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” said the president. “I have three of them.”
Moscow to allocate grants for reanimation offices of urban hospitals
Every year, the "Saving Life" grants will be allocated to revivals and intensive care departments of the capital hospitals.
The funds are made to encourage doctors and nurses.
The Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, visited the City Clinical Hospital named Judina.
During the examination of the clinic, he handed a letter of thanks to the traumatologist-orthopedist Viktor Procko, under the direction of which the most complex surgery for the reconstruction of the teen's foot was carried out.
Sergey Sobyanin also told about the decision to allocate annual grants to the reanimations and departments of intensive therapy of urban clinics.
The funds will be directed to the promotion of doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of the capital, the clinical hospital named Judina is one of the largest in Moscow to date.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment, allowing its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at the base of the Kolomenskaya Rural Hospital.
Currently, the offices of medical institutions are expected to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to the reanimation and station there are daily offices here.
The staff of the hospital is 2,800 people.
The total area of the hospital is 23.7 ha.
In February of this year, the medical institution became part of the pilot project on the organization of short-stay stations (SCP).
They are designed to carry out relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, allowing to significantly reduce the rehabilitation time of patients.
After the operation at the station they only spend a few hours.
Only in the first half of this year, 36,000 patients were hospitalized in a clinical hospital named Judina.
The clinic’s medical staff performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported the absence of buyers of Ukrainian "daughter" Sberbank
In the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported the absence of applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
About this on Friday, August 4, TASS reports with a reference to the representative of the press service of the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Victor Prokopeni for the settlement of the intermediated (via Paritetbank) acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank shares was revoked.
“Documents from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank’s shares in the NBU have not been received,” the statement said.
On August 3, the Belarusian businessman Victor Prokopenia withdrew the application for the purchase of the subsidiary structure of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused to buy the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank to Russian businessmen Said Guzheriyev and Grigory Guselnikov.
The regulator substantiated his decision by the fact that the businessmen did not provide the necessary documents to verify their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian "daughter" to Norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, the son of the Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the "daughters" of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among which was Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country for the benefit of parent organizations.
Trailer of season three "Narco": in the popular series of the studio "Netflix" after the death of Pablo Escobar the central role of the Cali Cartel
Despite the fact that the second season of Narco revealed the identity of Pablo Escobar's killer, the Netflix series is far from complete.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons are scheduled, and the third was already presented as the first trailer demonstrating the villains of the upcoming show.
In the third season, the attention of the Drug Control Agency was attracted by the richest drug dealer organization - the Kali cartel.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, are involved, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nikolas Haysom, the current head of the UN Mission to Assist Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for the post of vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative if women are fully involved in them and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The provincial council elections and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban is threatening to disrupt the election process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to advisors.
In this year’s elections, for the first time, power moves peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Heisem said that enhancing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

The materials are transferred to the Presnensky District Court of Moscow for substantive consideration.
In Venice tightened fines for tourists for unfavorable behavior
Venetian authorities have tightened fines for bathing in the canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walking around the city in a swimsuit or with a nude torso will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros will be required from those who organise a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle in pedestrian areas, TASS reports, referring to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide a fine for the inscriptions on the monuments of 400 euros and for the garbage of 25 euros.
Informing tourists about the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice will be with the help of the special company "Enjoy, respect Venice" (<0x23>EnjoyRespectVenezia) in social networks, as well as through advertisements and posters on the website of the city council, on billboards and in places.
The campaign will be held in 10 languages.
According to Venice tourism adviser Paola Mar, information on the fines will be transferred to the embassies of the offenders’ home countries in order to warn their compatriots of such mistakes.
“The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach,” she said.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit turmoil.
In Venice, the number of tourists visiting the city centre has already been restricted.
Instead of 100,000 people who wish to observe the Festa del Redentore, only 60,000 guests were allowed to attend the event.
In addition, a moratorium has been introduced for the creation of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice.
Officials of the State Border Service in the first half of 2017 detained 272 illegal migrants at the border with the EU countries; a total of 1,059 illegal migrants were detained.
This was reported in the State Border Service.

SF resigns Ozerov from the position of committee chief
The Federation Council on Wednesday endorsed the statement of the chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, Victor Ozerov, and relieved him of this position.
He remains a senator from the Khabarovsk region.
A statement with a request to release him from the position of the Lakes was written last week.
He explained his decision by the need for rotation and his desire to “change the rhythm of life.”
The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not a minute.
Victor Ozerov has represented the legislative assembly of the Khabarovsk region in the Russian Federation since 1996.
The Senator has chaired the Defence and Security Committee since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers of goods in Buryatia
More than a decade of efforts by the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
Since September 1, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial receivers has been reduced by 25%.
The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Regulation of the Government of the Russian Federation "On Amendments to the Rules of the Wholesale Market of Electricity and Power and in the cumulative Prognostic Balance of Electricity Production and Supply (Power) in the framework of the requirements of the Unitary Energy System of Russia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat commodity producers is reduced by a quarter, which will significantly make life easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic have smashed the thresholds of Moscow cabinets in vain attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with the cascade of hydroelectric power plants on Angara, which flows from Baikal, the main watershed area of Buhari.
It was only this year that the moves began.
In March, the tariffs on electricity for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles/kWh to 3.93 rubles/kWh, or by 7.3%.
With the inclusion of the Buryatia by decision of the federal government in the List of territories of wholesale price zones, for which the characteristics of the functioning of wholesale and retail markets are established, industrial consumers have come.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of the Irkutsk region pays for a kilowatt/hour of 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to name at least an approximate date for the new tariff trends towards the declining for Buryatia.

The National Union of Unqualified, Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) is concerned about capital investment at McVitie's plant in Glasgow
The union demands guarantees from the managers of McVitie's cookie manufacturer in connection with its long-term manufacturing commitment at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has silenced the issue of future investments at the tolcross facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie’s, reports that over the past few years it has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the facility.
The company adds that in case of any changes in the work of the facility, employees and representatives of the trade union "know about them first".
In a letter to the head of the facility owned by the company, the Scottish GMB department demanded McVitie's response to concern that funding would not be released for the modernization of production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “Our union members are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the facility’s general manager on the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tolcross.”
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in the local society and in the territory of the Great Glass; this is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the growth of the living minimum and the chronic decline of production, East End Glasgo desperately needs the prosperity of production at McVitie’s factory.
According to Pladis, “The head of the Tolcross facility received only yesterday a letter from the Scottish GMB, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our constant cooperation with employees and representatives of the union.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with employees and GMB representatives, at which a number of issues were discussed openly.
We talked to employees that like all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions – and this applies to all of our facilities and areas of activity – to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our tollcross facility, especially in production lines and improving functional performance.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolkross as a production facility, and in the event of any changes in the work on this facility, employees and union representatives will be the first to know about it.”
Putin said the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the cabinet of ministers should join the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (OECD), but no one will give instructions to Gazprom like Rosneft.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin’s request to help resolve the conflicts that have arisen.
The head of state noted that the relationship between Rosneft and Gazprom should be resolved exclusively on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for HNCC threatens the implementation period of the project.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
Gazprom offers to find gas resources from the Rosneft perimeter, but we do not have such resources," Sechin added.
Rosneft asked her to allow it to use gas for the Eastern Petrochemical Company from the Gazprom field of Kyrgyzstan, located on the Sakhalin shelf.
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on the issue are ongoing, and “there are no sharp corners.”
Did the PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar’s transition three years ago?
"La Liga" member may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
“Paris Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neymar after the club offered <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to redeem him, but have they warned Barcelona of a world record robbery that took place three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window when the League 1 club was ready to break the world record at the cost of a transition, more than twice the previous mark associated with Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for 89 Futsal.
When the transition is over, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, as the PSG offers him a salary of over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week net.
Barcelona is known to be angry at how the offer was made and how Neymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, according to a source close to the leadership of the Catalan club, the club has always done everything possible for the player since 2013.
But hasn’t the football world been warned of such a possibility three years ago by the president of the “PSG”?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in hiring Blaze Matthews in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a strong warning to any club who would like to beat one of the best players of PSG.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we’ll act against them, we’ll make suggestions to their players,” Al-Helaifi said.
“We respectfully treat all the clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they’ll have consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line when the Spanish club expressed an interest in the midfielder from the PSG Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
The PSG has made it clear that it will not release the Italian team under any conditions, and now Barcelona is likely to feel the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neymar.
Putin ordered to deal with the payments of those affected by forest fires.
Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered to understand the material aid, which is allocated to the residents affected by forest fires and for the construction of new housing.
Today I would like to hear how work is going.
In particular, please report on the case of payments and compensations to injured citizens.
I've got some variety.
"In this regard, I would also like to ask my colleagues about how much money is allocated," Putin said at a meeting with the leaders of the regions located in Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the authoritative representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District, Sergei Menaylo, and the head of the Baikal branch of the FGBU "Glavrybvod" Leonid Mikhailik.
They talked about the work on the clearing of the lake.
The males were then shown in an open container next to the container, which were prepared for breeding.
At first, Putin released several boys from the sack.
Then he pulled a special lever on the lid of the container and released the rest.
Also during the trip, the leader ordered to deal with the environmental situation on Baikal and to build a road on the island of Olkhon.
According to the Ministry, one volume is required, and a supposedly different volume is provided.
“I want to understand that, in fact, there is funding going on with us,” the Russian leader said.
We recall that during the 2017 forest fires were covered by fire the settlements of Buryatia, Irkutsk region, were destroyed residential houses and farm buildings.

Novotroitsk became the first monorail of the Orenburg region to receive TOR status.
It should be recalled that the territory of forward development is an economic zone with favourable tax conditions, simplified by administrative procedures and other privileges, which is created to attract investments to improve the lives of the population.
Among the benefits for residents of the Republic of Croatia can be the following: income tax of not more than 5% during the first five years, and not less than 10% during the next 5 years, social contributions of 7.6% for 10 years, the use of the rate of interest, the use of the free customs zone, the preferential rate
