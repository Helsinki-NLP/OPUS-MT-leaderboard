In an emergency call, the professor admitted to shooting his girlfriend.
During an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb confessed to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and needed them to come home.
Lamb imagined that his "sweet dog" was home alive and probably upset, and that contacts with the dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the police found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten note on a white paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," the letter said.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to a school campus where police believe he shot his favorite professor Ethan Schmidt in the door of his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said the university’s staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb said he made a fate phone call to the emergency line shortly afterwards.
Eventually another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at the school, students and faculty were forced to hide behind closed doors, with the authorities still trying to find out what Lamb’s motivation was.
The details, published by investigators on the state side as well as students and employees who knew him, together created a picture of a talented but probably problematic teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lesson.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no records in the criminal record or a violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote to thank the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both were taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History together with 17 other faculty members and many students attended courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations when it comes to problems.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also appeared agitated and shaken, "as if something wasn't right with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was facing stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to leave for health reasons when he said he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s recruitment meant that the doctorate, in which Lamb worked hard, would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
William LaForge, president of the University, said he did not know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb apparently had something to do with it."
Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After leaving the campus, police caught his footprint as he crossed the Arkansas state border back into Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb was killed by a single gunshot in the courtyard of the house about a mile from his parents in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington State Colonel Methel Johnson confirmed.
The car started off on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went into this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which reads about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and hours of education.
He received a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny person.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb’s 20 when they met through common friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older boy who taught her guitar for several years.
It was quite heartbreaking at the time.
The heart of all the girls recovered as soon as it appeared,” says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss were supposed to have been together for some time.
During an emergency phone call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the marriage record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the shoulder of the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was okay.
Ex-husband Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said of her daughter.
She was with her mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he hadn't met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail performed at a summer festival three years ago.
Later they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a stovelighted bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5th, sweat that Lamb played on the guitar and harmonica for countless crowds.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We were playing and recording each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialised in original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boys' student club and student government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, some 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students and community members, took part in a candle-like memorial event.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also participated in the vigil, during which the college choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The school started again on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get our students back,” LaForge says.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis filed a report in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to the report.
This story was edited to reflect the fact that the police are now claiming that Lamb made an emergency call after killing Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually seasoned.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us says they won’t pick up as many seasonal workers as last year, but manufacturers of children’s toys and products say they will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire around 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company announces that it will start recruiting candidates this month, and will recruit employees between October and December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching, and companies are preparing to temporarily accept employees to assist in stores and sales, for shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his ‘rande’ with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the arrival of the royal family when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I knew that Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in a trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in time."
The film starts and I find I'm on the verge of something that could be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," is a documentary about "Back in the Future," which features talks with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, “It’s truly the best travel documentary ever filmed for me.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
U.N. chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s accelerated military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief has again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of countries - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the verge of a ministerial meeting at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that the division in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "has made this situation insoluble."
Ban called on five permanent members to express the solidarity and unity they showed in reaching Iran’s nuclear deal in solving the crisis in Syria.
8 Election Numbers That Show Donald Trump In The Real Light
Some have tried to label him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others held their hands as if they were an unspeakable joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they are not (so far).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in charge of the two-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously ask what that means for the nomination odds of this real estate magnate.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this suggests that Trump is likely to win a Republican nomination.
Experts point out that during this time of 2011, Rick Perry’s leadership made his way to the ascension of Herman Cain, eventually not one of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are a lot of reasons why it could happen in the general election.
But outside groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bush and the economic conservative club for growth realize Trump’s willingness to stand up and start spending their dollars on his stand to knock him down.
Here are some recent polling numbers that suggest that real estate magnets are not just a passing phase:
Trump’s rating of favourability turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, the Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of this real estate magnate.
In mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion on him.
And these numbers are held in the initial stages.
After the Quinnipiac University vote last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion on Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “satisfied” or “satisfied” with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "shocked" by his nomination.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be “excited” against 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next level of excitement?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "dissatisfied" if Jeb Bush's favorite became a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his outrage and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide are inclined to think that real estate has the right temperament for the presidential post, according to the ABC News/Washington Post vote on Monday.
The same number is held at the Iowa state senator's club, which is the first in the country, where 52 percent of Republicans think they have the commander's personality, according to Quinnipiac from last week.
Yet 44 percent think they don’t have a personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independents say their temperament doesn’t belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to this idea.
When he wears his science hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeba Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
During the last round, 4 out of 10 Republicans selected Rick Perry as the winner of the nomination against 28 percent for Mitt Romney’s eventual nomination.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as credible.
Even though Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some scholars stress that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely spread among more than a dozen other candidates.
But the Monmouth University survey from the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical straight fight between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the majority’s support.
He leads over Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Ruby by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rande Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points at each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would lead the trader by 19 points in a one-to-one hypothetical match.
The naked majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have already made their opinion.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of Trump’s voters claim that they will no longer change their minds.
It is obvious that a lot of things can change it, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46% say they keep an open back door for a change between candidates.
Still, Trump’s current strongest opponent is his outsider colleague neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion to be final would go twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violent" in his campaign announcement speech, immigration has still been held as the main and central topic of the 2016 conversation.
Some fear that Trump’s brilliance will distract the key Spanish voters from the Republican party and try to rebrand the damage.
But according to a new poll by ABC/Post on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as the issue of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain as well.
The frustration of the government is reaching new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive about half the support from Republican voters, especially due to their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post poll on Monday say they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
They are also very angry with Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellly angry."
The House has supported a greater share of the state's coal fees.
The Czech Republic will receive more than <0x24>400 million.
In the first reading, the House of Representatives supported the government's draft upper law, which regulates the amount of extraction fees from coal mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (CSSD) promised the members that they would receive money in addition to both the state treasury and the municipal budgets.
The proposal was criticized by the opposition MPs, who fear that the mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The House of Representatives in the first reading should support the government's bill from the state, which would remove the top law.
The share of the state will increase to 67 per cent, while the share of the municipalities will decrease from 75 per cent to 33 per cent.
The proposal also changes the method of calculating the payments for the nerosti that the companies will benefit from.
The change in the fees for the mining of nectars is expected to bring to the Treasury 427 million more crowns than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenue of the municipal budgets should have a neutral impact because the fee should be higher.
Last year, the municipalities received approximately 450 million SEK of fees and the state budget of 150 million SEK.
Brown coal mining cost the municipalities about 200 million kroner and the state 66 million kroner.
The novela also expects an increase in the payment of the mining spaces with a allowed mining of 1,000 crowns per hectare per year.
Revenue from these payments shall continue to belong in full to the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (CSSD) told MPs that thanks to this, the municipalities earn between 14 million and 100 million kroner a year.
The amount of the extraction fees will no longer be determined by the law, but will be determined by the government by its regulations.
The compensation shall be recalculated as a component of the amount of non-growth extracted and the rates for individual species of non-growth.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that the fixing of the fee by government regulations may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mladka, it is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the nero, which is state property.
Fees are paid only to municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the municipality’s money and a quarter of the state will receive.
The same applies to the extraction of radioactive minerals.
The amount of money that the state will collect on the fees from the mining will be purposely bound.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damages after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The proposal was criticized by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that it would damage the mining village and the region.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and Staro<0xC5><0xA1>tová) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
“It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to make Mr. Finance Minister improve his budget,” said David Kádner, elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>svit region.
MEP Hana Aulická warned of rising unemployment in Mostecka.
Kádner and Aulicka unsuccessfully proposed to reject the novel, Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted the law to return to the government for processing.
According to mining companies, the increase in taxes will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are more than 90 percent long-term contracted.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or thermal plants should not feel the price rise.
"But on the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in salaries by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it believes that the increase in employment fees is plausible.
According to the reporter for the novel Milan Urban (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), it is crucial that MEPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government’s decision on the limits of coal mining.
If coal is to be mined beyond limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and the community, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mladka that the decision to break the border at the base of the Czechoslovak Army should fall until 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of the <0xC4><0x8C>SA should be broken already due to social, national economic reasons and due to the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Happy will lead the Czech Republic as one, deployment will influence the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on Thursday at the Davis Cup draw in India on the table, and this time each of them is likely to get into the game as well.
Captain Jaroslav Navratil plans to spread the burden on the entire quartet due to the difficult conditions.
In Delhi, there is hot and high humidity, so tough matches are expected, which can stretch up to five hundred.
We have to take this into account.
I'd like to spread it according to the weather.
And according to what it will look like, Navrátil said during today's training of the Czech team in the centre of Ráj Kumár Khánna.
With the first team and the world's 40's, Ji<0xC5><0x99>im Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> counts for both Friday and Sunday.
Lukas Rosol and Radek <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánek are likely to be in the twin position.
I'd like almost everyone to get involved.
I've got a little bit of it in my head, but I'm not saying it yet, said the captain.
Another certainty in the Czech assembly should be <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánkov’s participation in the Saturday Fourth.
The only question is who will stand next to an experienced fool who has an 18:4 in the Davis Cup.
It probably won't be happy.
There's still a chance with Rosal, or Adam Pavlask.
"I really don't know with whom and how it will look," Navratil said.
It will be decided according to the development of the two.
The variant may be Pavlásek, with Joselyn surprised by a first round victory in Debla over Australanya.
"He's really decent," he said.
“I managed against Australia, and when I play, I’d like to show the same performance I’ve shown since the second set.
"I'm happy for those experiences and I'd like to bring a point," said Pavlásek.
Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP ranking), who won the challenger last week in Shanghai, where he defeated players third and fourth in the ranks.
The duo will be Somdev Devvarman (164th).
Both are players from the challengers and ours have experience in the ATP Tour, but we have been convinced many times that the Davis Cup rankings do not decide.
"It decides the momentary form, the weather," he said.
Friday’s opening hours start at 6:30 AM and can be extended due to the weather.
It's predicted to rain and it's not under the roof.
However, it can possibly be played under artificial lighting.
They've already burned it, and it's got about 2,000 lux, which is enough.
"It should be put under the lights," said Navratil.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Mr. Corbyn's debut in PMQ has been highly anticipated since his election.
New CEO Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut in Prime Minister's Questions later, and will have to work with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will pose the first of his six allocated questions shortly after noon, while his performance will likely be carefully examined by the media and MEPs.
In a weekly statement, he called for "less theaters and more facts."
He also said he could skip several sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby’s leadership, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to remain silent during the national anthem singing in service on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met with critics from a number of conservative MPs and is the focus of several notes on the titles.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
Mr Corbyn's spokesman said he would "stand in respectful silence" and recognize "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But Corbyn’s shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told BBC Two’s Newsnight that he would recommend the Labour leader to sing the national anthem “regardless” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in economics, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of parliamentary parties initially supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "arranged" after Mr Corbyn's appointment over his position in the European Union and the government's grant limit.
Mr Corbyl said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party had tabled amending proposals to remove the whole idea of a limit on allowances.
A few hours later, Smith, secretary of shadow work and pensions, said the party was "very clearly" opposed to government plans to cut the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Party leader faced by David Cameron in the last decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The Labour Party leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from the crowd" for questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North claims that PMQ is too confrontational and will refrain from both “urgent responses” and dental trade, and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at PMQ if he does not participate — such as when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also renounced the idea of letting other colleagues speak for him from time to time because he had heard that he was still discussing the whole matter with House Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr. Cameron became a leader in 2005, he said he wanted to retreat from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics, which was often associated with the PMQ, but a few years later admitted that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of leaders' judgment, their leadership of the House, and their stance among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become a caricature and need far-reaching reforms.

The pound rises while the UK’s wage growth accelerates
The libra jumped the following dates and showed a recovery in British wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led above using the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and June GB profits including bonuses increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009 and it seemed as if the estimates were approaching when the rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar at <0x24>1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an outstanding stock in the market and jumped 20% after receiving a close offer from its rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and bring brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch closer together.
Burberry stocks were 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from rival group of luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, have begun to rise again.
Shares in Glencore rose by 5% after mining giant said they rose by <0x24>2.5bn using shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Stocks in the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest drop on the index and fell by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs lowered his company rating to "sale."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sports company announced an 83% jump in pre-tax earnings in mid-year
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Harm Expansion
CEO of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, said a higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean “greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would outperform the higher wage costs in his company, he said.
The costs could affect JD Sports’ plans to expand, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment marshmeloun are chasing.
The controversial building got a hit.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision illegal and will appeal against it.
Against the building, which is to be built in the vicinity of the Ane<0xC5><0xBE> monastery in the center of Prague, 1 hundred people protested in front of the Prague office, and a petition was issued.
The magistrate in the decision noted that there was a violation of the construction law, because not all the matters of the territorial decision were complied with.
"The territorial decision in question does not include some matters, such as the type of land, the distance from neighboring buildings, a sufficiently clear and comprehensible description of the shape of the building, the definition of the area affected by the impact of the construction," the decision states.
It also considers that some of the documents for the decision have been issued for the originally discussed documentation, but it has changed.
This is the opinion of the environmental authorities, for example.
Part of the building is to be constructed on the premises of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the records that, however, the landowner has only given consent to the project documentation for territorial management, not consent to the location of the building on its land, writes the building order.
According to Francesco August Razet of the investment firm, the department of the construction order did not take note of the decision of the supervisory authority - the Ministry of Local Development, according to which the deadline for initiating the review has already expired.
In any case, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, complying with all the laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the relevant authorities and institutions," Razeto said in a press release.
The project, which people call marshmallows because of the supposedly designed colored facades, inspires strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city center in the past to protest against the construction.
The association and residents of nearby houses are concerned that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that had to look different.
They also criticize the inadequacy of the building for the historic center of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Ane<0xC5><0xBE> monastery.
The house was designed by the architect Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Fránek, the project has changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which was calculated with a glass façade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture based on the opinion of the National Monumental Institute (NP<0xC3><0x9A>) and cancelled the permission of Prague monuments in 2010.
The new project of Praga Progetti e Investimenti with face-shaped windows was approved by the NP<0xC3><0x9A> and the monuments of the city and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the opposing ideas, saying he never counted on the facade in pink, which gave the project a nickname after the pink-white sugarcane.

On the way, he and his crew took three Syrian refugees into their cars, who they said were about half a mile away.
At the time, it was not criminal in Hungary, he claimed to the Lid newspaper.
We knew that the guardians of the law did not interfere with such conduct.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and took us to the Szeged investigation facility, he described the letter.
In the end, he spent nine hours in the cell.
The police said they behaved correctly, but the communication was heavy, because they did not speak English very well.
Prison, however, was sad.
For example, in our cell about three times four meters, 15 refugees from Syria were depressed.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were shut down on the second day and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what was going to happen to them, Berg said.
What can't be fun anymore?
Ask the President of the Executive Chamber.
On Friday 18.9. from 9:30 am, the President of the Executive Chamber of the Czech Republic, Mgr. Pavla Fu<0xC4><0x8D>íková, will answer the questions of the readers.
You can ask her about changes to the law on executions applicable from 1 September 2015 and other matters related to executions or executors.
Metcash launches campaign in the countryside to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA trades from Aldi’s resistance in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches campaign in the countryside to fight Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food vendors and building the IGA brand showide through marketing in mainstream and social media.
IGA merchants and suppliers are adding brands such as Dunsborough-based Simmo's ice cream shop offering IGA tastings and store owners sell discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when food, alcohol and hardware vendors will celebrate their annual investor strategic day.
There is a lot at stake because southern and western Australia represent almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA trading steps and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in southern and western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in the U.S. and 24 percent in WA compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will account for 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores that have taken over revenue from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
This week, analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA retail could lose <0x24>360 million on annual sales and Metcash <0x24>250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West over the next year, and will generate sales of <0x24>500 and <0x24>600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in the Metcash fixed price base could cost him around <0x24>13 million on pre-tax revenues, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing its market share in the eastern states, mainly against Aldi and Coles, although Roy Morgan’s latest survey found that IGA buyers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the financial group Magellan, said that business lunches in Melbourne could “highly likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglass' comment.
But it's known that a member of the Metcash board contacted Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenues from Metcash’s food store, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of speculation change as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler has gone counter-attacked and invested more than <0x24>150 million a year to level counter prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers to reequip stores by adding fast-growing food and newspapers.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says price leveling and business upgrade programs are catching up, and hopes that wholesale will return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Australian Tennis President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for her behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has become a side loss in a recent habit around her friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for her behavior, Tennis Australia President Steve Healy said.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," attracted unwelcome attention thanks to the affair with unfamiliar Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the referee twice, Harrison then declared, "Wawrinka had to pull one to Kyrgis and I had to pull him as well."
While the last time he was seen breaking a rocket after the crash upset Richard Gasquet's possible U.S. Open, Kokkinakis unwaveringly defended Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he is competing with Sam Groth for the second place behind Bernard Romic in the semi-finals of the Davis Cup against Britain.
"I've been thinking quite intensively about the fact that in my opinion Thanasi was a little stuck in the whole dispute," Healy said.
He destroyed the rocket when he lost because of the U.S. crash, but he's not the first player to run out of frustration on his own rocket. I know Thanasi well enough and I can say that he won't be proud of this event.
But he really did manage very well because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the U.S. because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves great recognition.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he has been treated a bit hard.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and fits into the team great and so on, he has never had a problem with other players, in the wardrobe he is very respected, he trains hard, he is in amazing condition, he is very stable and advanced in his mind, he's a young boy in a cradle and I think he's
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios because of the important game that starts on Friday, saying that "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but it encourages Canberry natives to return to the team as a long-term stand.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not on all the controversy that has arisen around him," Healy said.
And I think Nick's been up very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people show, in the public eye, he's growing fast, he's also made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he's got, but we're going to try to support him for years, we're going to try to help him, we're going to try and help him.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
On Tuesday, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia and detained those who tried to overtake it illegally to stop the influx of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants gathered in the country and the Serbian authorities reacted revoltously.
Those who have been trapped for an unknown period on the belts of land between the two states stand up those who run away from violence in their home countries, stand up and settle down.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flew over them, the migrants shouted together, "Open the border!" and put in the Hungarian police order unit.
Some people refuse food and water to protest.
The Serbian foreign minister says it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect harm.
In the coming days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after bloc 28 failed to come up with a unified immigration policy at ongoing meetings in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in surprise Italy and Greece and spoke in hopes of reaching a possible deal next month or end of the year, which the EU nations would accept more than 120,000 more refugees, including Ma.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened a special EU summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis on Tuesday.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday’s state of emergency in the two southern regions gave authorities more power to solve the crisis and allowed them to close roads and accelerate court cases for asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a fence from a fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence is now completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D <0xCC><0x81>Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped pull the wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point to the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants, who go for a better life, not war refugees, who seek protection, which is a distinctly different view from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalize the violation of the 4-metre fence that the government has allowed to build on the southern border with Serbia, and also establish longer prison terms for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern town of Szeged.
In this case, it is clear that crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Technically, parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army, which was awaiting next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have been observing a heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban’s Home Defence Advisor, said authorities had arrested 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 had already been caught in the state.
They have penetrated the fence with damages and are now accused in police custody of committing violations under the new laws.
The authorities quickly cleared the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a trailer covered by a wire.
At the main border crossing near Roszke, chaos arose because the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and created people’s printers.
About 20 of them went in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton’s rise before Bernie Sanders halved in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still holding a two-digit hike in the Democratic race for a national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders holds up her hike.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of the Democratic primary voters (58%) while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is to announce whether he wants to become president, receives support from 15 percent of the Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main contests, the most democratic voters claim it is too early to say that they are clearly the choices which candidates will support.
But Clinton’s sponsors are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month’s CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground to several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton maintains a big leap between women and is mitigating, but her leadership is shrinking.
Her support among men has drastically decreased and Sanders only loses 5 points to her.
Clinton’s advantage with democratic voters under 50 has vanished and now they are equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has great leadership thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a two-digit jump ahead of Sanders among the Liberals, but now Sanders is losing only 5 points in the group.
Approximately half of Democratic primary voters across the country say they would be enthusiastic to support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with certain reservations, and another 15 percent would support her only because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
It’s not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are particularly upset about her.
The views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton — only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16%), then that it’s time for a woman to be president (13%), and that she’s the best candidate for this job (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
There is also a great choice of choice and consensus on the problems.
While the vice president is considering a potential presidential nomination, 57 per cent of the Democratic primary voters would like to take the lead – a third think he should not run.
If the primary democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for party nomination, Biden is the most common choice.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters said Biden was their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democratic nominations, Hillary Clinton’s leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden runs, to 30 points without his nomination.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, this figure fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely to be elected is increasing.
However, when there was a question of the greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer solving the problems to greater chances of election.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate acts as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics among the primary voters of their party.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and credible and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in sincerity, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don’t think Clinton is honest and credible, that’s twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t think so.
Primary democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden in line with their ideological outlook.
With regard to all these criteria, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state continue, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that their overall view of it is not in the eyes.
But among the American public, it’s a completely different story.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with its explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public’s views on this topic were shared in March, shortly after the issue emerged.
Most Americans claim that this email controversy has no impact on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent of their views on Clinton have worsened.
It is mainly about Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim that their views on Clinton have deteriorated.
Although Clinton is perceived as honest and credible among her party’s voters, this question is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and credible, which is a decline of eight points from last month, and a drop of 15 points from last month.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don’t think it’s fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trump as honest and credible.
However, Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush were the best leaders.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of voters have not commented on him.
The range of errors in the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ends with Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in recent CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates account for half of the voters in the latest poll, and the others leave the support behind.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by a stirring majority, rising from 23% of the support in the latest CBS poll prior to last month’s Fox News debate to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson conducts well across demographic groups, and excludes Trump from university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorin and Ohio Governor John Kasiche, is behind with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker completely willing with 10% support fell to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all third together with 6%.
The range of errors in the 376 Republican voters sample in the latest poll is plus minus 6% and occurred in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed that Carson improved and achieved 19% support among Republicans with Trump’s 32% support.
A recent survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is far ahead of Carson.
With Carson’s rising trend, Trump decided to blindly shoot a neurosurgeon in retribution, and Carson even apologized for hearings about Trump’s faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood accused of death of first-year student Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died during an overloading brotherly ritual in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, a murder charge was filed against five people.
The members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Dogs brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and later took him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Police say he had his eyes tied, a bag full of sand weighing 30 pounds, and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach the target across the frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of headaches and then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 immediately after Deng fell asleep, and allegedly waited for an hour before being taken to the hospital, police say.
However, they found time to change Dengo's clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the nationwide president of the Brotherhood, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, members started hiding equipment and essentially preferred the well-being of the fraternity over the life of Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
He could not resurrect him, and he died the next morning.
According to the pier report, Deng was repeatedly hit by a silly object in his head, trunk, and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated by overloading in the fraternity, and at least one student dies every year from overloading since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Dengue family, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be accountable and this step is important by the authorities.
The Grand Jury of Monroe County recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with overloading and criminal association.
“We want to detain not only the parties involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will also take them to responsibility,” Wagner said at a press conference.
Baruch College banned fraternity and national fraternity cancelled its relationship with local branches.
This happens when the Fed raises interest rates.
The rate growth will come and the bull market will slip, debt yields will rise and the economy will slip into recession.
We know all this.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
Specifically, for the economy, the history of a small originator offers timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve system in raising rates is often, though not always, determining how the economy and financial asset will react.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rate increase will begin, but rather on the trajectory of how long normalization will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the flaw due to the increase in speed can be exaggerated.
“The Fed’s first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the ‘cheap money’ era,” Julian Jessop, head of global economist Capital Economics, said in a statement.
On the other hand, we do not expect that a gradual return of U.S. interest rates to a more common but still low level will create a seismic shock that many might be afraid of.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here is an overview of how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has recorded in the last month, the expected rate increases may make the air a bit volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
“There seems to be a trend for a re-stop of stocks 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect a delay in monetary policy,” analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed’s increase.
More precisely, in the last 35 years, the market has often the most - about 14 percent - tended to increase the rates in relatively flat in 250 days (average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returns to the normal state of the company after 500 days, no more than 4 percent, down to 14 percent, down to the average of the average.
Deutsche said the impact on shares tends to become more pronounced later in the cycle of rising rates and returns are beginning to fall.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but rising rates often help it.
The Fed is currently facing some conditions that have not yet existed and that could accelerate the recession.
The most notable is that the gross domestic product near its lowest point in history with the Fed’s rising rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate increases since 1950, the nominal annual GDP growth was only twice below 4.5 percent.
Despite the fact that in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, few expect it to stay, when in the third quarter it was just 1.5 percent, the Atlanta Fed said.
Increasing rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question might arise, “whether this time is different,” Deutsche said.
Market participants were prepared for the growth of the Fed all year round and all eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that FOMC could approve growth at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
“In our study since 1950, all of the increase cycles so far in the super leverage increase cycle with GDP covering the peaks of the beginning of the recession were very quickly after the recovery began,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery since the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, we are now at 74 months and we are still continuing.
Fixed returns were also volatile because the market expects rates to rise and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more noticeable in bonds than in stocks when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, returns appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/decrease cycle.
At the end of the cycle of increases, debt returns drop immediately,” Deutsche said.
Strategists Charles Schwab believe that rising rates will lead to a rapprochement of yields between long- and short-dated bonds, which equals the curve.
High-income bonds often work better in this climate, although “we are still careful about yield tightening,” said Kathy Jones, a solid fixed-income analyst at Schwab in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adapted to the expectations of the Fed’s policy.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook of a more stringent monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, the credit margin has expanded and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will win after rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will get worse as the growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be greater.
“History shows that the ‘quality’ of stocks tends to surpass within three months of the initial rate increase,” Goldman Sachsve said in a statement for clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets anticipated weak balance sheet companies in every interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004, on average by 5 percentage points.
High-income companies, as well as low-volatility stocks, also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become a big problem.
Companies with high interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to purely stock games, consumers are also profiting thanks to the growing dollar.
Savers can also see their profits through higher yields, but experts have different opinions on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticized the station for "shooting"
He believes that he is increasingly indistinguishable from his commercial competitor.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they’re just cheating on the British.
MP colleague Damien Collins attacked Voice and says he's not an original idea either
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" in Classic FM, the front-runner claims and accumulates fresh pressure on broadcasting to prove they're doing something that commercial broadcasting isn't doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC chiefs that the public service radio station appears to be "scratched" and is increasingly indistinguishable from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like using the word 'cooled' - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which began in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seem to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that attack me, when you're actually just imitating what we already have in the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC's director-general rejected the allegations on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn’t have learned on any other radio.
And their commitment to living with music and creating music is actually at the top level.
“I also think that the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and put it into operation is also very important,” he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to get the audience involved than before because the British are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that got under fire due to slaps on the heels of commercial competitors during broadcasting Culture, Media and Sport and got to the hearing of the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as being non-original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a manner typical for the BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" when it will launch a fun series next time.
However, he declined to exclude ordering multiple future series of The Voice or spending taxpayers' money of license fees on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest rate since August and can be blamed for Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth was recorded since the beginning of records in 2000.
Internet sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe November’s Black Friday could be the reason for spending cuts
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, and thanks to it, many of Britain’s main streets have become ghost cities.
However, experts say there are signs of steady online sales, and new data shows a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Overall expenditure in August represented the lowest growth increase since the very beginning of the 2000 measurements, with an increase of just 5% compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of steady online sales, and new data shows a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
“When you look at the growth levels of past years and go back to the year 2000, the situation has always been streamlining over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told The Guardian.
He explains that internet sales were boosted three years ago, when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on a sofa.
But now (growth) is a bit stagnating, and therefore it seems to be responding.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was wanted from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could delay purchases prior to this event, which takes place last Friday in November.
Last year, more than five times the average buyers turned to their computers to arrange their purchases and sell several retailers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which buyers re-contract, can keep customers from making further purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 was spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, rather than shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims Bury Victims of Mine Crash in Mecca and Bin Laden Family Sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were transported to the streets by Muslims at the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia blames the collapse of construction magnate Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the fall of a crane at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Dressed to some extent in white, the mourners chose their way and paid tribute to the victims when the first of the fallen was on their last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moaiss.
The sad message passed around the holy place, where just a few days earlier the construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and threw itself on the believers.
The body was released for the funeral and the Saudi king sanctioned the construction group of the bin Laden family over the disaster, which also left 394 wounded.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall of a crane at the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried to the streets.
Among the dead was the father of four children of Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first flight when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi officials have already promised that the war will take place in Mecca and that thousands of people will continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadin Group should not leave the crane's shoulder up when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the statement, carried by the state-run Saudi press agency, says that the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the fall.
The UK disk agency's service did not report this detail, but said the company's bosses were banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to uncover what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims enveloped before the pilgrimage of Hajj later this month.
Binladin Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the crane and its representatives have not been made available for comment.
The royal statements also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
Binladin’s family has been in the vicinity of the Saudi ruling family for decades and is running large construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was the son of a renegade, whom the family renounced in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in the midst of a strong wind and rain just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom on the road, which every skilled Muslim must pass at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials determined that one million riyals (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) would be dedicated to relatives of the killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
The other injuries will receive half of that amount.
B&Q chief claims that Eastern European traders working for cheap are already trending
The British are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of educated traders from Eastern Europe is on the rise
The result is an open 200 Screwfix trades aimed at traders
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Rupert Steiner, Chief correspondent for Daily Mail
The British say they postpone hammers and brushes and hand them over to trained East European craftsmen to work at home
If you’re going with a hammer or a paintbrush, it looks like you’re in a minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out the work of the Kurds at their home, according to the company’s head for Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new Chief Executive Officer of Kingfisher, who owns the domestic supply chain, claims that a large increase in the number of educated traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 additional Screwfix stores targeted at merchants, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laury says she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better halves.
Currently, most of the workers are male.
She said there is a need to address rising demographic trends that show more female households performing more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laury says, "We still have mostly men working in the stores.
We need to get closer to the balance.
Essentially, half of our customers are women who carry out 80% of their purchase decisions.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Laura, who is one of only five women at the board of directors of the UK’s FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect equality between men and women’s executives.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half of the women's representation among employees including the executive and financial director.
Mrs Laura said: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
So it wasn't difficult to find the good women we'd take to us.
Kingfisher announced a decline in both profits in mid-year and sales after the group took on the costs of closing the stores.
As a result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores
The December contribution of 600 kroner to pensioners is in jeopardy.
"It's the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said TOP 09 Vice President Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of merit.
Zbyn<0xC4><0x9B>k Stanjura, the president of ODS MEPs, noted that the one-time contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better to be in standard valorisation, because it would be reflected in the years to come.
"We have room to find the mechanism that we will arrange it," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marks (CSSD), according to which he was to be valued beyond the law next year.
Marks defended the grant by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she does not believe is pink.
A higher valuation next year would mean a budgetary impact of 5.5 billion kroner and ministers are debating every trillion.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (CSSD) on the right reminded that in the past the rate of valuation has decreased.
The rapporteur Miroslav Opálka (KS<0xC4><0x8C>M) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The right to veto payments in December will be considerably complicated and perhaps even impossible, he said.
The president of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD MEPs Roman Sklenák therefore proposed to shorten the deadline for discussing the standard in the committee to ten or 20 days, even the right blocked it.
The committee will have a month to do so instead of the usual two.
The bonus is expected to cost a total of SEK 1.73 billion.
In particular, the money should come from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the next year, pensions are expected to grow on average about a hundred pounds.
The contribution should be given to pensioners who will be eligible for a pension or part of it in December.
It could also be obtained by those who lost their pension entitlement in December before paying it.
However, they would have to apply for an additional fee in writing, no later than the end of next year.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly valued by January, with a price increase and a third of the real wage growth.
This year’s pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of gross salary, and next year it should be 40.5 percent.
The state spent <0xC2><0xA3>314.7 billion on old-age pensions last year, according to the state’s final account, which was about <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion more annually.
Old-age pension expenditures accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditures and 46 percent of all statutory expenditures.
The average full old-age pension last year increased by 104 to 10,714 SEK, according to figures in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration has secured the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and about 17,000 proportional pensions.
Jakunin has abandoned plans for a political career, will devote himself to science.
The senate chair, according to Russian media, was almost certain.
In the Council of the Federation was to represent the western Russian province of Kaliningrad, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov, as a candidate for the government of the United Russia party, defended his post in the Sunday elections with a review.
According to Russian law, senators do not elect citizens, but the governor elects them from three candidates whose names he will announce before the governor's election.
After the election, the senator will choose from three candidates.
The complication for Jakunina was that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
The Kremlin has found an exception for Jakunina to be an extraordinary and empowered ambassador, which is not subject to the legal requirement of long-term residence.
The filming of the Czech comedy Theory of the Tiger is over.
The last drop in the protagonist's preview is the voluntary death of his thigh, which has gained strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janzhurová decided about her grandfather’s life, age and funeral.
It is clear to Jan that he is on a similar journey with his wife Olga - Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzer.
He remembers that once he had his own will and dreams, he once again wants to live in dignity and freedom.
He wants to regain control of his life – and as a solution he chooses to escape from the past, Slavik said.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in a comedic form, in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role belonged to Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ka, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
However, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a long break associated with a relapse after a serious illness, said he was surprised.
We've had a deal three years ago.
I let him read the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I'm surprised he's probably a clumsy athlete.
Before filming the next scene, he always asked where he was going to sit.
This time he was riding a bike, climbing the cliffs and even walking down the hill.
All in record tropical warming, the director said.
According to Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ka, women take a tiger to make it a rabbit over time.
They feed him a little bit, but they close the door immediately so that he doesn’t accidentally think of playing outside the rabbit shop for a tiger.
And we're trying to tell our movie about it, the actor commented.
His wife, who may have a slight negative effect on the audience, was represented by Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Balzer.
She's not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and thinks well.
But at the same time, she is a usurper and wants to bake her husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film also illustrates the fate of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alenka - Tá<0xC5><0x88>a Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and the grandchildren of Erik and Pepík - Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film is produced by Petr Erben of Logline Production, co-producers of Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
U.S. internet company Google has pledged to provide an additional <0x24>5.5 million (CZK 132.6 million) to organizations that help thousands of refugees fleeing to Europe.
Google.org, which is a charitable donation to the internet company, said on Tuesday.
Azerbaijan has cancelled part of Teli<0xC4><0x8D>’s visit for criticizing human rights violations.
Czech MEP Pavel Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka has postponed his planned trip to Baku on Thursday as Azerbaijani authorities cancelled the official part of his visit.
Baku according to Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka justifies this by last week's EP resolution, which criticizes human rights violations in Azerbaijan and which Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka co-authored.
By the decision of the Azerbaijani party, Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka lost the opportunity to talk with official partners and also to visit political prisoners, which depend on the consent of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press release.
The route, which was planned several months in advance, was intended to be used by Teli<0xC4><0x8D>ka to meet with parliamentary leaders and executives as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent by the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
The European Parliament resolution condemns "unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European officials to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was passed shortly after a recent verdict against Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadija Ismailov, who was seeking to uncover corruption in government circles.
Russia does not exclude that it will build its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky did not rule out the creation of a Russian air base in Syria in the future when he visited Novosibirsk.
We don't have plans like that yet.
Nothing is excluded, he said.
Russia already has a long-standing naval base in the port of Tartus in Syria, which has been used as a service and logistics center.
According to the Russian press, since the beginning of August, supplies of Russian weapons and military materials to Syria have stalled.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from current trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians are planning to establish an air base near the city of Latakia, which for now remains the palace of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Washington, however, does not fully understand Russia’s concrete military intentions in Syria, U.S. commentators agree.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on Tuesday about the situation in Syria with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, their third phone call in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will go to Moscow to express concern over the accumulation of Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Assad’s support from Moscow for a lost bet.
Russia’s policy objectives in Syria are rather vague.
According to him, Moscow made its own satellite from Syria.
That may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a rather long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not quite clear.
According to today’s Russian press speculation, the war in Syria will be the main topic of Putin’s speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly in New York.
On the contrary, the Russian leader says he does not want to talk about the situation in Ukraine’s Donbass.
According to the New York Times, the U.S. government does not rule out the possibility that President Barack Obama could meet with the Russian president during a UN meeting.
The views among the White House advisers are still diverging.
TASS today, referring to the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, wrote that Putin has not yet had a meeting with Obama on the agenda of his New York stay.
Plant sesame oil in the gallbladder diet, hemp helps to strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When pressing from the seeds in the cold, all the healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these are the most common cause of death of Czechs for several years.
Gland inflammation mainly affects women, sesame oil helps.
If you are one of the lovers of Asian cuisine, you should not miss sesame oil in the skies, which is part of the original recipes for exotic food.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in thermal treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of the formation of gallstones.
They are the cause of 90% of inflammation of the gallbladder and women suffer from these problems 3 times more often than men.
In general, problems with the bile are especially related to people with overweight who do not exercise and consume a lot of animal fat.
Sesame oil can be used successfully even in the liver diet, which is very similar to that of the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that the consumption of this oil brings, they should pay attention to the goods from exotic grocery stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use cross-seeded seeds to grind, which have a more pronounced taste.
The oil, however, will lose all the active substances, Ladislav Ha<0xC4><0x8D>ek<0xC3><0xBD>, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Olej from Kraslic in Sokolovsk, which produces organic virgin oil pressed in cold.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively uncooked seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our lizard will be able to shed 8 kilograms of sesame.
With mechanical grinding, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the extra virgin designation.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil benefits in diseases of the heart and vessels.
The Czech favorite among the oil is sunflower.
A study by Jarmila Hamerské, who led Masaryk University, found that 43% of respondents preferred it in a hot kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, it starts to ignite at 180 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
It is better to use it, for example, to taste salads and is especially suitable in the diet, in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids reduce the cholesterol level the most.
When dealing with heart problems, it is necessary to pay attention to the amount of total fat and calories consumed.
For example, in one teaspoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in a teaspoon of rapeseed oil there are 99 calories.
As for the energy value of foods, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
They are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to touch after extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last as much as sesame and hemp for 9 months.
With storage in the refrigerator, the durability will be extended.
Old oils are known to people especially for their bitter taste.
On the other hand, there is no pitfall on the bottom.
This is a sign that the substance has not been chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Technical hemp seeds are among the so-called superfoods, and hence hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This name is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself and one must take them from food.
Particularly important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while Icelanders consume 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil is suitable to be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and in the healing of wounds.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential component of cell membranes.
People do not have to worry about using hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms the fact that Bohemia Oil is one of the best-selling companies.
It is sold for 500 liters a year.
People often take one spoon in the morning.
Hemp oil is not at all tasty, but it will greatly boost immunity, advised Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the carnivore company Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, the most ambitious nation of grillers are Americans.
There are 1.4 barbecues per household.
Then, around the world, a variety of barbecue competitions are held, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There are no Czechs in the back.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people did not eat food in their lives.
Most of them even grill a few times a year.
In order for grilling to be successful, we should not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to prepare the meat by marinating a few hours before heat treatment.
Which oil is best suited for this and at the same time will leave the health-benefits in the barbecue?
In general, during the grilling process itself should be saved by fat.
Experts agree that a large part of the oil begins to lose its taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose the body of beneficial substances, which we otherwise obtain from them when consuming oils from meals processed at lower temperatures.
However, this does not mean that extra virgin oils will not find their application when grilling.
Grape oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When meat is said, experts from the company Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk will be immediately equipped with grape oil.
It adds to the taste of fish and meat.
In the kitchen, it is characterized by the unique properties of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
Even at such high temperatures, as one of the few oils retains health benefits, Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek from Bohemia Oil describes the benefits of grape oil, which belongs to a few Czech producers of this vine oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linoleic acid, and is therefore effective in combating excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favourable content of these substances, it helps to lower high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
Consuming grape oil also helps to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and fractured hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for preparing cold dishes, for example, when tasting salads, but also for thermal cooking of dishes.
Therefore, when grilling, it can be used immediately in two ways, when marinating and grilling itself.
By marinating meat and fish, we preserve their juicyness.
When preparing marinade, three ingredients must be present: oil, acidity and spices.
Add the acid, for example, with apple vinegar to soften the meat.
The spices, in turn, supply the mass of flavor and the oil preserves and delivers the correct cutting, advises Daniel Vl<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating directly because as one of the few oils it can sneak through dark meat.
So marinated meat or fish are ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are needed to prepare their dishes.
The same goes for grilling.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This is especially the case with linseed, hemp and grape oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling yourself, rub the oil, thus preventing the ignition of food.
An essential part of the grilling is also the preparation of attachments.
To grilled meat and fish is suitable for virtually anything - grilled vegetables, roasted bread, light vegetable salad and many more.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil, for example, recommend hot summer salads.
You will need: <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 1 piece of peach <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 1 handkerchief <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 1 cup of chopped cucumber <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 1 cup of salad leaf mixture <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 3 tablespoons of grape oil
In the salad bowl, add to the mixture of salad leaves a sliced currant, chopped cucumbers and large pieces of chopped broccoli.
Depending on the taste of salt and pepper, you can also taste ground chili and soy sauce.
Finally, dip a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Distributed sclerosis: it depends not only on medications, but also on the patient's will to fight.
Spreading sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: a neurologist, physiotherapist, ergotherapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about therapeutic care, for example, women with diffuse sclerosis also need consultations, if they decide to have a child, the care of these patients also includes social law advice, recommendations in the adjustment of housing, etc.
However, all this is not enough: the development of the disease can fundamentally affect the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and doesn’t have to change his lifestyle.
As doctors warn, the passivity of the patients frees up space for the activity of the disease.
For example, it has been shown that regular movement significantly delays the time when the patient needs some compensatory help, such as a rod.
It is important not to subject patients and their surroundings to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads to the end of the wheelchair.
For this reason, the Give a Chance (www.bezmytu.cz) page was created, which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give a Chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with scattered sclerosis is a neurologist.
In the case of scattered sclerosis, it is said twice that the sooner the disease begins to be treated, the more the doctor can affect something.
This is because we have medicines for dispersed sclerosis at an inflammatory stage, where the neurodegeneration process is not yet so strong.
The sooner we take action, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and delay the disability, explains Dr. Eva Med from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with diffuse sclerosis rehabilitation care, which most often addresses weakening of the lower limbs or disorders of balance.
It works with patients according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, mitigate swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the specific problems of the patient," says Dr. Martina Kövári, associate of the Clinic of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine of the Faculty of Hospital in Motola.
People with diffuse sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in a slightly different way in everyone.
Rehabilitation can’t stop the disease, but it can always alleviate its symptoms.
However, exercise also strengthens the immune state of the body, which is desirable in the case of dispersed sclerosis.
Another positive thing about regular exercise is the fact that the patients check out what they can do, and this strengthens their self-confidence.
"Endorphins also flutter during exercise and one feels well after it," says PhD. Kamila <0xC5><0xA0>asová of the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine of the Royal Vinohrady Faculty Hospital.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
This is how we directly intervene in the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease.
"Earlier these patients had so-called savings, today we know that they need a targeted load," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolá<0xC5><0x99>, Senior Director of Rehabilitation Clinic and Physical Medicine of the Faculty Hospital in Motola.
The goal of physiotherapy is to keep a person as self-sufficient as long as possible, including occupational inclusion.
Physiotherapists therefore work with ergotherapists to ensure that each person receives compensation aid with a tailor-made embroidery.
Many patients also need the attention of a psychiatrist or psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people will shake it.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
It must respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a shattered soul, we have to follow someone, not try to seize everything on our own.
"I am working with them to finally conclude that even with a disability, a full life can be lived and that scattered sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubert from the Neurological Clinic of the Faculty of Medicine.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, airbuses would not fly.
Aviation production is synonymous with precision and advanced technologies.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials that no one can manufacture or process right away.
However, next to super-precision, computer-controlled machining machines, next to autoclaves for forming composites, you can come across something as common as melon pecks.
In the drum, which resembles a pot of sugar wattage, the edges of the sheet metal parts, which have just come out of the milling machine, are narrowed in the bulk of the bag.
"No one has come up with anything better yet," smiles Ivan Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>, CEO of the Latecoere Czech air doors manufacturer.
At the premises in Prague, Letov produces a complete door for the Airbus A320.
As the only one in the world, they deliver doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, part of which is assembled in Prague, also enter the first and higher class passengers on the upper decks of the world’s largest transport aircraft Airbus A380.
There is also a door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto.
For example, the torque keys let the company arrange twice a year.
If the yellow sticker is missing a checklist, they should explain something at the Prague plant to the Airbus or Boeing auditors who drive regularly to check if the doors are manufactured in accordance with the agreed rules.
The human senses, however, have not yet completely replaced the advanced technique.
There are 1,500 newborns at one door to the A320.
They have to be manually dismantled.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the hitting hammer, they will know if the nest is already properly unlocked.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
Newt can rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That's about twice the thickness of human hair.
There is a range of exercised touch when checking.
When the controller passes through a series of threads, it will know if someone is out of tolerance.
Only then take the exact deviation meter in your hand.
Letov was fed before 1989 the program of the exercise military aircraft L-39.
But in 1991, there was not one.
The company had to quickly find new jobs.
At the time, it was joined by the European airliner manufacturer Airbus.
She won the selection process for the A321 Emergency Door Supplier.
The talks with Boeing weren't that happy.
“We were a small company for them at the time that didn’t have enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing a stable long-term supply,” Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> recalls.
The door to the U.S. manufacturer would remain shut if Letov did not attend the Prague International Aviation Industry Association conference of the French Latecoere Group in 1999.
I was talking about working with Airbus.
The next day, talks with the French began, says Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new contracts came with a strong company.
In the year 2000, the installation of parts of the door for the A320 was discontinued.
Three years later, the upper deck doors for the A380 were added.
In 2006, the company built a new hall for the processing of composites due to deliveries for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't be able to get to these big contracts ourselves.
Maybe we could make parts or small parts.
Partners want delivery guarantees for twenty or thirty years, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> explains.
Last year, Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and a profit after taxation of SEK 147 million.
Exclusive position between aircraft suppliers is not free of charge.
Latecoere has invested 1.5 billion SEK in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certifications of 170 special production processes and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without them, the company would not have built any doors to the aircraft.
To obtain certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of the customers, and to keep them in repeated checks, it is worth the millions of DKK.
Production processes change every year.
They are more precise and strict.
We need to train employees, equip the facility and re-certify the entire process, Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
Now the company is completing the preparation process for zinc and nickel coating, which will replace the so far harmful cadmium for human health.
They received the request from the manufacturer, but then had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing are coming in, they're going to check out the whole line concept.
Then we'll show them the production.
They're checking our lab as well.
One set of samples are tested in their own laboratory and then the results are compared to ours, approaching the Dubsky way that the samplers check them.
The rewards are long-term exclusive contracts for Prague firms.
With the Prague plant today, the production of embrayers is standing and falling.
For the A320, it produces half of the total volume of the door.
Replacement of Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very complex for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
But that doesn’t mean you can say anything at the door.
The price curve is part of the contract.
It indicates how much one door will stand for ten, fifty, stitches made.
The price per piece is constantly falling to a certain limit value.
We have to go into this price formula.
If not, we'll go through, says Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Half of the hall, where the electric cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are complete, is still empty.
It is a symbol of the future.
Behind the fence, a new semi-robot line is being built for the refurbishment and installation of doors for the new A320 Neo.
The renewal will be accelerated and precise.
“This is the trend that is taking place in aviation,” Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
The future line is secured.
Airbus said the airline had ordered 3,278 new A320s.
Just a few meters next to it will form a line for the complete installation of the door for the A380 upper deck.
It is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The goal is to reduce production time and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin in two years, says Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
First, however, the company must pass the qualification tests, for example, for the installation of certain electrical and electronic devices into the doors of the largest Airbus.
The company is also committed to further development of the production of composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, she is also expected to participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
“It’s a huge credit for the company to be able to process composites in addition to metal materials,” says Dubsk<0xC3><0xBD> proudly.
However, Latecoere is at the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no other place in the Letov arena where he lives.
Before the entry of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now it has 800, and in three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are overreacting on how many hundreds of new airliners are ordering each year, they may not have to worry about work.
Although it has contracts for several years ahead, the Prague parent company Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money to repay the loans in September.
Eventually, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, some of the loans were exchanged for shares.
The creditors gained a 37.4 per cent stake in the company by increasing capital by 57.4 million euros.
The company’s debt fell by two-thirds, i.e. 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company acquired new shares among existing shareholders for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222.9 million.
In total, the capital raised by 280 million euros.
The entire group is benefiting from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of its sales.
The average contract growth is expected to be 4% per annum by 2017.
It has orders of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.6 billion in the order book, which corresponds to four-year production.
French media say that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the droplets.
The Czech race in the Prague Summer Olympics is important for the groups.
It contributes 16% to the group’s revenues.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
MEPs supported a greater share of the state's coal fees.
The change in the fees for the mining of nectars is expected to bring to the Treasury 427 million more crowns than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenue of the municipal budgets should have a neutral impact because the fee should be higher.
Last year, the municipalities received approximately 450 million SEK of fees and the state budget of 150 million SEK.
Brown coal mining cost the municipalities about 200 million kroner and the state 66 million kroner.
The novella also expects an increase in the payment of the mining spaces with the allowed mining to 1,000 crowns per hectare per year.
Revenue from these payments shall continue to belong in full to the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (CSSD) told MPs that thanks to this, the municipalities earn between 14 million and 100 million kroner a year.
The amount of the extraction fees will no longer be determined by the law, but will be determined by the government by its regulations.
The compensation shall be recalculated as a component of the amount of non-growth extracted and the rates for individual species of non-growth.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that the fixing of the fee by government regulations may not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mladka, it is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the nero, which is state property.
Fees are paid only to municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the municipality’s money and a quarter of the state will receive.
The same applies to the extraction of radioactive minerals.
The amount of money that the state will collect on the fees from the mining will be purposely bound.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damages after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The proposal was criticized today by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that it would damage the mining-affected villages and the region.
For example, Michal Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era (TOP 09 and Staro<0xC5><0xA1>tová) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor the municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
“It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to make Mr. Finance Minister improve his budget,” said David Kádner, elected in the <0xC3><0x9A>svit region.
MEP Hana Aulická warned of rising unemployment in Mostecka.
Kádner and Aulicka unsuccessfully proposed to reject the novel, Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era wanted the law to return to the government for processing.
According to mining companies, the increase in taxes will not be reflected in coal prices, as prices are more than 90 percent long-term contracted.
Therefore, major consumers such as power plants or thermal plants should not feel the price rise.
"But on the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in salaries by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it believes that the increase in employment fees is plausible.
According to the reporter for the novel Milan Urban (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), it is crucial that MEPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, in particular, the government’s decision on the limits of coal mining.
If coal is to be mined beyond limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and the community, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mladka that the decision to break the border at the base of the Czechoslovak Army should fall until 2020.
According to him, the limits at the bottom of the <0xC4><0x8C>SA should be broken already due to social, national economic reasons and due to the long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world is watching the US Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they will remain inactive for some time and keep interest rates between 0 and 0.25%.
It’s a historic event because it’s been a year since the Fed lowered rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank could be able to get out of the zero lap and start the process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been doing relatively well, there has been a recovery in the form of adding trillion dollars to the state account and creating only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less pink global outlook.
They warned the markets to be ready for an increase, but the circumstances show that they also see a great chance against this step.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET.
Shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday — and later his colleague on the same day — wrote a message claiming he was “sad” of his first murder and wishing he could take it back, government officials said on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi said Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning at about 10 a.m.
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the detective to send a policeman to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "scary dog" in the house that "will not bother anyone" but is upset.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't show up.
Lamb also did not explain why he was shot in the house.
When the police arrived at the scene, Amy Prentiss found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message from Lamb, which read: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she’s the only person who ever loved me.”
After leaving the message, Lamb embarked on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
William LaForge, Dean of the University, said he did not know about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "obviously something was happening in Mr. Lamb's head."
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt, government officials said there was "no evidence" of a "love triangle".
Shawn O’Steen, who had been married to Prentiss for more than seven years, said she was a “great person.”
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but the two remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was “shocked” by the whole case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss's close friend, Sun Herald said, Prentiss was working from home over the internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Blitz, had been with Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help others,” Knowles said.
The police said Lamb had spoken to his relatives on Monday and said he would “not go to prison.”
When he was reached by police on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled to the woods where he was shot.
According to a biography published on the school's website, Lamb received a PhD in education at Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who have lost their magic
The actor (left), in a picture with his son Redmond (right), has several stressful years behind him.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia and in 2009 lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor also allegedly had a drug problem and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
I'm sure all these things are picking up their taxes.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be out of the game for several months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double right leg fracture during Manchester United's defeat in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-back left the injury in tears and kicked him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by Hector Moren's reckless 15-minute operation when 20-year-old Shaw broke into PSV space.
He was treated on the playground for nine minutes and needed an oxygen mask before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture and now he's in the hospital."
It will be shipped tomorrow or maybe tomorrow and then operated in Manchester.
It's awful - the guy who comes to Manchester at the age of 18 has a very hard one, but he's playing fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in the dressing room, he also had an oxygen mask.
Crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture of the leg requires six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he will still play this season.
Moreno was lucky not to have a red card and a penalty kick.
Arbiter Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can decide for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly operation on both legs.
Shawa tweeted: "Thanks to everyone for their messages, words can't be expressed how destroyed I am, my path to recovery begins now and I'm going back even stronger."
Manchaster United records injury to Luke Shaw in PSV defeat
The English defender will have an added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It was a very ugly injury."
When any player leaves the playground with such an injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt opponents.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture in a match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt opponents, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I was not able to see this moment.
I only saw the ball pointing in the other direction, so it looked like [Moreno] had touched him, but I didn’t see a move on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after surgery by Chris Smalling.
Will David Cameron know The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this: when a child loves a book, it doesn’t take long for them to learn to remember.
You can't be David Cameron.
When asked by a child's scheme provider to name a favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a 1971 fairy tale by Dr Seuss.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: “Funny, impressive, creative and with strong content, I liked reading it to my children because there was always an image or message behind it that I had never seen before.”
Well, only after that in the next paragraph Cameron allegedly described the story according to the 2012 movie elevator, which added more characters and details to fill in a brief original text.
"In the town of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by a wall, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, who does not realize her desire to see her real-world objects behind her."
Jacoby himself wasn't suspicious enough, the text added by Cameron reads as a summary of the Lorax movie, which is on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville surrounded by walls, where the whole of nature has ceased to exist, with a stool, and even with a stool.
Since he was openly a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not be familiar with the history of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is being devastated by a county, falling trees industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the titleless, Lorraine's Scrooge.
Most likely, such a relatively less significant PR task was given by an assistant who never read Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron's supporters' office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's employee, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was at risk of England's neglect, but still holds
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after looking at the team England has chosen for this tour, I think the 3-0 rematch she suffered in the test series last year is unlikely.
I would also not directly exclude the winners.
The side of Alastair Cook may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spinners in this stabbing set and collective thinking is also strong; they don’t bear scars from 2012, only youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test series level, represents an attacking possibility.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of England in a season-experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to ignore Adam Lyth is a hard nut to analyze for me because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were against two good attacks in tough conditions and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are judged based on performance.
For example, there were no questionnaires around the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because — and this I mentioned earlier — players are their best selectors.
A few more half-century and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Let's hope that if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his stance, even though his performance wasn't 100%, and that doesn't surprise me; he's always been a team player.
The question of how much testing time the stalker gets to show up is a hard nut.
Lyth got seven hats — like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and outside.
The only thing you could do is that England gave Jonathan Trott the first chance in the Caribbean—although Lyth was in the best shape—but this missed opportunity is already past.
Alex Hales is coming, and he's a killer, which I appreciate very positively.
He's the x-factor cricketer we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he won 236 at Trent Bridge, which he did a little bit.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but all of this will of course depend on the overall composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting next to Cook, who would get another extra spinner while keeping four quicks, was raised and I have no reservations against it.
I don't understand why the strokemaker can't fire and this left-handed man has already shown that he's an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was number three for them and there is no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 runs before his performance in 2001.
He had succeeded for three centuries, and he did not even look.
Zafar Ansari joins the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to follow him, he attracted me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough statistics — an average of 31 with a stick and 35 with a ball — and I see it as a spider, but there are not many spinners who would raise their hands, and the selectors chose for the youth.
There is a lot to learn on this tour.
Beyond that, England seems to have made some changes and smart additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, a fighter from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches can be a championship move.
He is one of the most beautiful playing guys who bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the white-ball tour and brings both energy and ruthless sparks to the team.
I have always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the wardrobe, even though they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham’s co-player Ben Stokes got a one-day break, as did Root a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and selectors do not make a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken on a light weight.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy begins to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron's unsuccessful renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU is getting into further problems with every last day, even without choosing the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to head the Labour Party, or he will get to TUC on Tuesday in the European Parliament.
The aliens also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is plunging into various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough British egocentric agendas, split concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided that they did not want it even if they starved social protection.
We can even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The prime minister and the chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local admirers, and then return home with words that they win the Allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an unpaid Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached a point where they don't get away with it.
Angela Merkel, a carefully balanced German Chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to quit her post before it becomes bad for her, as it was for too long running Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French President François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also falling.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It’s hard to watch how they break their legs while helping Selfie Britons, who could invest their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – which is something they themselves don’t want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may plan deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the campaign ahead of the 2017 UK referendum to speed up the Brexit process, a friend says.
"Renegotiation solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing worth negotiating."
Europeans know how skeptical Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the EU is of the press oligarchs because they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our 1973 entry in a 2:1 ratio.
They can still remember the name of Boris Johnson, a successful Euro-opportunist who made his name as a Brussels reporter "EU straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
Despite his ugliness, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of tax-free scammers, foreign hacking phones, and pseudo-foreign departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with an angry gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so she won't take you to dinner and then to tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum routine, since Blair admitted the principle of abrogation of the EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and earned him a card of expulsion.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who was friendly to me in Westminster on Monday - I told him he shouldn't waste time on me anymore - seems to be in danger of re-accepting Murdoch Neil Kinnock's boycott strategy, which was a mistake at the time.
It may take some time, but it needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, who left his seat at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin's official stance on Europe is, I would say, evolving.
He says he wants to stay in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's angry tendency and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly get on with it.
The same was said by Hilary "Bem, but not Benniite" Benn on radio and television this week, when his internal scout couldn't resolve to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive McDonnell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father was fighting for his loyalty on television without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary’s game was much more attractive.
But to fight to stay "in all circumstances" - Benn's phrase - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background is, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey – don’t forget, he touched me too – the message discipline remains important in the age of all-day television broadcast, and especially in the faith, the birthplace of paranoia and treason that are social.
It is fair not to provide Cameron with a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to consider the Labour Party’s support in the referendum campaign as self-evident, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell’s and Corbyn’s basic distortion of membership in the EU – in line with their Bennite-occupied economy, anti-capitalist past – is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion between left-wing dissidents, for which narcissism of small differences is the central essence of the hashtag.
As with his crackdown on NATO – Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end it – foreign diplomats will have to try to understand the meaning of all this for their homeowners.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital – they also have suspicious voters – on Britain’s concessions, if this seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed by Brice's "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the cost of a conservative government in power, as I was reminded of Monday's launch of something called the Security Forum of the United Kingdom.
Experts Criticize Reviews of Electronic Published by Public Health England
A government-funded statement that e-cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are associated with the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet to criticize the evidence used in their e-cigarettes report by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE agency published a "many" report last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the breadth of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The launcher in the Lancet expert magazine last month attacked an "extremely cozy base" on which PHE based its main findings.
Two other experts writing for BMJ have questioned the claim, which was allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They say the public could expect that the PHE agency’s claim, which sounds “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking,” is based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a single meeting of 12 people called to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the damages associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarized in the research study.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is said to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also approved the public health mandate of BAT in the Sustainability Report, it states.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting admitted to funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not funding he allegedly received earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also declare industrial funding in newspapers.
Some other attendees at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting at PHE was also attended by the tobacco management.
The report was created in this group of "extraordinary admission," lacking "hard evidence of the toxicity of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the PHE claim that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the claim at BMJ had already been answered earlier.
He said, "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two smokers dies because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are comparatively small, but we need to continue to investigate the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and also what they do not, especially when there was so much confusion in public about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die annually from smoking and smoking-related diseases cost the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion annually.
By clearly emphasizing the current evidence - that although e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they only carry a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competences.
The BBC should end EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would "give the right hand" for hit shows like Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for deploying public service programs that are likely to be watched by just a handful of people in the complex broadcast times compared to its rivals "the biggest rating show, and on channels like BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he was unsuccessfully trying to connect with the BBC for the entire six years he worked on Channel 4.
"I fight with the idea that the BBC is inputting and broadcasting programs that would certainly be broadcasted by rivals without state contributions," Johnson said in the Upper House Communications Commission as part of the BBC's talks on the future.
If you keep licensing fees that I’m not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, it should reduce the creation of at least for programs that others don’t produce or charge.
They broadcast The Voice in the main broadcast time, because they want to get the widest possible support in the future.
The idea that no one else would send it out is a ridiculous joke, and of course it makes no sense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without contributions.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course made on home soil.
Honestly, other channels would quietly put their right hand behind them.
I can't understand how these are public broadcasting services.
I don’t think it would weaken the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty for contributing ratings “because of the ambitious people who worked there and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support.”
His commentary on the BBC's most popular shows repeats those of former Sky CEO Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said even more haunted BBC public service programs "go to BBC4, where quite often the audience can't be measured, but they're fulfilling their powers and can argue when they're preparing for their hypocritical mission to justify <0xC2><0xA3>4bn of revenue, which doesn't pay off those license fees, either.
They're broadcasting them at a time when no one's watching them.
As for the license fee, Johnson told the commission, “I call on you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value from it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot, I would be surprised if they pay so much because they don’t look at the BBC that much.
Former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who spoke before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its mission in the sense of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production had already been classified as educational - it was 1% television production and 0.1% radio - and should take the pattern of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and turn to "inform, clarify and ba."
On the topic of the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like Proms, which were only a handful of broadcasts on television, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
"Sonogenetics" or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how the sound impulses affect the direction in which the balls move.
Scientists have educated worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Small balls change direction when they are hit by acoustic impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching the cells of genetically modified motor neurons, which are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists can read and record brain activity with light
Scientists said these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart, and muscle cells and is activated outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes are inserted into the brain of the patient.
The bubbles usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction is delivered when they are placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, the bubbles are amplified by ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the body of worms.
Increased ultrasound waves work in TRP-4 ion channels, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells they are connected to, says the report in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control balloons using ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When he used ultrasound on such modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transferred to worms, where modified motor neurons were turned on.
The new method is in many ways similar to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light.
Chalasani, however, was told that sonogenetics could have many advantages compared to this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate the tissues without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
“We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases,” said Chalasani.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and cells producing insulin.

Advertisements stifling the British arms trade.
Watch the video on the anti-weapons market from Amnesty International.
A terrifying killer drone!
Eyes on the legs that break the ankles!
Triggered bullets!
And electric slippers that cause unbearable pain, but leave no traces!
The joyful voice and caricature of the metaphor leaves no one in doubt that this advertisement at the world's largest arms trade fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International due to the emphasis of the British government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Forces of the International Centre.

300 posters are created by artists exhibiting their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
The Collective Special Patrol Group has helped them distribute across London and using the "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is <0xC2><0xA3>6 per piece of Allen key, which is said to "give access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not entertained by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to audiences outside the gallery.
Many artists are switching to working with activists within the protest movements and realizing that they have to get out in the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.

The Amnesty video was viewed by more than 100,000 people on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by VCCP working without the right to a fee, and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding gun trafficking advertisements — he saw an empty spot on the ExCeL calendar — and thought, “Let’s show them a campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with creating more realistic risky corporate ads, but "by adding colorful colors and animations, I aimed to attract more people."
“They did a fantastic piece of work and helped us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture tools at the fair,” said Amnesty’s Tom Davies.
What we need now is for the Government of the United Kingdom to take action and ensure that it does not illegally trade in torture facilities on our border.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from within ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. military for "on the shoulder of the ignition AT4CS RS."
This includes "a single-shaped head that delivers amazing effects beyond armor inside the target."

Eight Golden Rules for Life at College
11 years ago, I moved to college as an indifferent 19-year-old boy, still believing in bareness and moral relativism, but now I am equipping myself with the tense smiles of those I have worn -- and numerous, lengthy complaints to others.
Everything I’ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to the tracks can range from slightly on the nerves going to completely shocking.
It's tempting to fool: tell people where you came from, if you took a year off, what you think of Corbyn, and why "you don't really love or hate Marmite, because people, it's just an extract from HAHAHA yeast, I'll be in peace with you."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to inspire as well - ask and show interest.
It runs the conversation, and it helps you find the people you like, and the ones you wouldn't deal with even if your scars were in one fire and they were delivering fire extinguishers.
Let people have space.
People's rooms often turn to a drink reception, movie venues, and communal public places, but they're also rooms where people dress up and change their underwear.

Introverts to high will come soon.
Your room should be a haven, yet many railroads are turning into an out-of-peace walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendships.
It can be hell for someone who needs to be charged.
No culture lets you say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to find out when your partner is tired of socializing – and maybe write to him instead of slapping.
When it comes to chatting: chat.
One boy in my lanes used to say that if the door isn't locked, he's invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends with the baking.
Because you started going to college at the top of the baking lantern, clamping on a foreign door and performing with a canvas baked cake seems negligiblely less strange, less like, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile while I'm smiling at the person.
Offering home funnels is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you and maybe it all ends up assigning your face to a tasty surprise.
This is, of course, the subject of being a decent baker.
Badly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and fat are likely to guarantee that others will pretend to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Theft of food is a common crime on student tracks.
Theft of whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk in your tea theft?
Check it twice with the owner of the milk.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're mad inside.
If someone steals something from you, it’s annoying and you have my sympathy – but try to deal with it a little more mature than my roommate who exchanged her milk for a dishwasher to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You should not make sounds that distract people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also renowned people in glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked her neighbors if they could shut up a little drum and bass, because it was 3 in the night and she had a note in the morning.
The answer was to enhance the music.
When they finally got up at 5 a.m., she let them sleep quietly for two hours, then she released her own music loudly, closed the door and went to her three-hour song.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future walker walked on the same track as you?
And, on the contrary, wouldn’t it be terribly embarrassing if you confused your roommates for your future home, slept together, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and maybe she would also take control of your common friends?
Of course, you don’t recommend the heart – but if your sexy roommate is not your future mate, try at least a little talking to your weaknesses.
In the uplifting moment, when you realize that someone has left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin line between joking and whispering.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about protecting them by hiding something – never ruin someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door to them and put the keys in a bottle of water, which you then put in the freezer - but never stick their things to the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to twins despite uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a rough moment in her pregnancy with a seven-year-old Witk today.
His father broke up with her and to prepare and raise the offspring was alone.
I managed to cope with the situation relatively quickly - I was very looking forward to the baby and I was looking for a positive in it.
Because of the uncertainty and the fact that I was alone with the child, I tried not to bother.
And I certainly had hope in me that we would not be alone for a long time, reminds Eve today of her first pregnancy.
Already at that time, she met on the internet in the chat room of older Va<0xC5><0xA1>ka, with whom they began to talk about their favorite movies.
Va<0xC5><0xA1>ek even brought Eva and Vítka home from the maternity ward, but he didn’t get too excited about the role of his father-in-law.
"For a while he then resigned from the program," Eva described in the documentary series Four in that 3.
The theme of the third series of the Czech TV series is the search for luck for a second try.
The care of Vítka and the financial security of the family managed thanks to part-time work and great help from mom and aunt.
Even the prospect of responsibility for a foreign child ultimately did not distort Va<0xC5><0xA1>kov’s affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around Vítk’s second birthday and he now understands Va<0xC5><0xA1>ka as his father and also addresses him.
Although Vasek already has two adult daughters, she enjoys paternity in her 60’s, according to her words, and is also more dedicated to children.
In addition to Vítka, two-year-old Leont<0xC3><0xBD>nka added them and finally a twin.
“Your family has been so naturally involved, maybe even by my mother never talking to me about relationships,” she smiles.
Few spaces?
At least we're close.
The twins Ema and Ela were born by caesarean section after Eve was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of pregnancy.
This is a disturbance in the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excessive amounts in the blood of pregnant women and manifest themselves in particular by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, in the mother after childbirth usually spontaneously disappears.
Ema and Ela were born healthy to Evin and Vasco's happiness, even though they were only in the 36th week.
Em<0xC4><0x8D>ka was placed in an incubator in an intermediate department, where Vaskov’s nephew also works, who was able to take over and accommodate her.
Elika was bigger and immediately after transferring from JIP to the room I had her with me, describes the difficult period after the birth of Eva.
She spent twenty days in the maternity ward until the doctors agreed to release the baby, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
Waiting for the birth of the children at Eve's maternity house did not make her happy.
"I was insane about my husband and children," recalls a four-year-old mother, who was in the department on Friday.
She and her husband also considered signing a reversal, among other things, due to the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
Eventually, however, the doctors let Eve and her twins go home.
The stories of four pregnancies and childbirths are broadcast by <0xC4><0x8C>T1 on Tuesday evening at 9:45 p.m.
A large number of families can be humbled.
They live together in a small cottage near Prague, where Eva had to meet with an electric two-stroke and tightened conditions.
The house did not enlarge, but Vasek made Eve happy by mounting a gas stove to make cooking for six people more comfortable.
If it's the worst, we'll take a taxi.
Eva is convinced that the children especially perceive family well-being and a pleasant atmosphere, not the size or breadth of the house.
So far, we've been doing a lot better than we expected.
Although the disorder is worse hidden in a small space and we sometimes cross the cornering baby, but at least we are all nearby, Eva smiles, who can find a positive side to every situation.
Wax's work of the illuminator in the film is not a guarantee of regular reception.
Sometimes he goes to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
At the age of 60, he said, he can physically take care of the finances of his family and children, how long will it be?
“I realize that given our age difference, I’ll be the one who will feed this family,” Eva admits on the level when asking about the future.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of owning her own business.
With four kids, I'm not exactly a suit for employers.
And if it's the worst, my husband and I can get a taxi, jokes a nice blonde.
Apple has the Jo-Jo effect.
The screens are responsible for everything.
A more powerful processor, a higher resolution camera, a more robust chassis or a touch-recognizing display are the advantages of the newly introduced ninth generation iPhones.
The latter two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
So far, Apple’s trend has been that every new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was only the third and fourth generation, whose weight increased slightly compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram difference in the disadvantages of the news was, however, really negligible.
However, this is not the case with new iPhones.
Compared to last year’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams for the smaller model, followed by 20 grams for the larger one.
On the one hand, it’s not surprising that last year’s affair of bending in Apple’s pockets has greatly supported.
The new chassis is made of more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which has also proven its weight.
But they have a much greater impact on the screen.
Apple uses 3D Touch technology, which allows displays to recognize the power of touch.
To do this, it was necessary to provide an additional layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of the displays of the new iPhones has more than doubled compared to previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone from the original 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of a larger one from 19 to 40 grams.
With the iPhone 6s, the display is the hardest-to-use component.
The weight of only 143 grams is also achieved with this new product thanks to the degreasing shell, which touched most of the remaining components.
In the larger model, the hardest element used is the battery, but its weight has not changed in any way compared to its predecessors.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is seen on the display.
The 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus weighs 192 grams.
As much as the new display technology will be practical, it will only show up when used.
The first users will be able to test it on Friday, September 25, when the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will be launched in selected countries.
Have you been eating breakfasts of champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, archaeologists have succeeded in finding, which opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of settlement by a modern man from different eras, including wall paintings, remnants of tools and so on and so on.
In the 23A layer, which, according to the instruments, dates back to about 30,000 years ago, scientists have discovered something very reminiscent of the rest of the breakfast buffet.
In fact, there were traces of oat grains found on the site, which apparently went through the process of producing so popular slices today.
With it, the grains dries first today, then dries, removes the packaging, so-called pulp, then burns and scatters suddenly.
In the Paglicca cave, a grain was found that was supposedly heated or burned, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least as evidenced by the traces of use on two stones in the cave.
Thus, in their publication for PNAS magazine, the scientists were unable to prove that the entire process of producing ticks would take place in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very noticeable.
We also don’t have any evidence of how people could eat steaks, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and maybe even warm enough, of course, is quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensively people used cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
In fact, if the float interpretation is correct, the oldest float preceded agriculture by about 20,000 years.
New station reports in the City of Brno Transportation Company.
So I once again listened to the announcement of the names of the stops in the trolleybus: Hnu<0xC5><0xA1>a<0xC4><0x8D>kova, P<0xC5><0x99>ízrak, Frazova, Sprateká.
Sure, the trolleybus was a bit louder, so reporting with a male voice was a bit less comprehensible than before when the stops were reported with a female voice.
The female voice is louder, so in the deeper noise of traffic, it is more discernible than the deeper male voice.
Although the DPMB argues that this speaker was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but certainly chose it from studio recordings shot in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different from the frame of a bus engine.
I have been living in Brno for a good few decades, so I know the correct names of all these stops, so I don't need this report, but foreigners who don't recognize themselves in Brno and for whom these reports have been intended, they can be confused, confused and confused.
Perhaps that choice of speakers - but better again the speakers - should be done again, and this time under-coloured by the usual traffic noise and engine noise, in which the loudspeakers in the bus are almost lost.
So that they would no longer have to listen to the names of the stations of Vodní Her<0xC5><0xA1>pice, <0xC5><0xA0>mírov, or then Ponorna in the creeping shale, to which I moved in Komárov.
I suppose my old-fashioned hearing didn't get so bad all of a sudden on the only day that the speaker of the stops changed.
Before that day, I understood the reports quite well.
Good morning, co-pilot.
From the track records.
Today, few know what the largest and smartest governments of the party were the so-called complex checks.
I've allowed myself to remember that.
The bus was late.
I shot the detective's office at the moment the radio heard it was just seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't hit a co-chef, came a minute ahead of you, and it doesn't seem like he's in the mood," the inspector noted while I was enrolling in the Income Book.
Thanks, I'll take a look.
Write me that I'm going to the crossroads for a little mechanization review.
It's not going to work, it's check-ups today.
They're all fucked up to horror.
What's the matter?
"You'll see," the dispatcher whispered.
Next time you'll be too.
I ran to the hallway.
Then the door of the chief was opened, and the chief appeared.
Tied up, with a stone face, perfectly falling in the same color.
"Good morning, sir," I greeted him respectfully and quickly turned on two buttons of the same horn.
"Good morning," answered the reply, and I quickly ran to the second floor without realizing the cold, vicious tone to which the old man answered.
"You're playing," said engineer Eva, an old lady whom I appreciated very much.
She said she was the chief of staff before her colleagues put her in jail.
There's check-ups and you'll be there as well.
How many times have I asked what the complex checks are, but no one really wants to talk about it.
They say they live once every three years, they all have to, and it's pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
But I'll see.
I pulled out a file with periodic reports and a phone call.
"Here Holcman, come to me right away," answered the chief's voice.
What's annoying?
We met now and nothing...” I was silent, but no one answered me, just everyone with their thoughts.
"Good morning, Comrade Chief, I came at your command," I apologized, barely entering the Chief's office.
The boss sat at the desk and looked at some listing.
"The mechanic," he said for a moment, without lifting his head and still carefully looking at the list, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the list on the table, lay down in the back of the chair, and looked at me with an ordinary, unpleasant, unpleasant, whispering look.
I've ruined it.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy complimented me that I had worked very well in the last few months in office and that I was very pleased with the honor.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the squad at a distance.
What about this now?
You know, you're a track distance technician, and you have to behave accordingly.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I noticed that I used such a greeting since childhood that I was so educated and I saw nothing wrong with it.
To the chief, it was like a red hat on a staircase.
"You're on the socialist railroad and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of work," said the chief of staff.
And besides, you're still confusing the addresses of the supervisors.
You'll say "sir" once, and you'll say "sir" again.
But I'm not a boss for you, I'm a co-chef.
The deputies are companions of the deputies, the top trammasters are companions of the top trammasters!
Remember that, please!
Excuse me, sir... co-chairman, but... but I greeted you with ordinary civic greetings.
There's nothing wrong with that... and it's an honor to work, or a co-worker... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your preference that you're not on the side," said the chief coldly, who had calmed himself a bit.
But there's still going to be talk about it.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a prepaid pension on the chair upstairs.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something wasn’t his preference, it didn’t look good.
For a moment he pierced me with a cold, swollen look, and I searched for words to answer.
I was also impressed by his heightened stiffness.
He was only a few years older and played the god, actually the god of companionship.
Wild, insidious, authoritarian, arrogant, as it is right now.
They're all running out of him.
Well, he's the boss.
Actually, not all of them, the president of the party organization, as well as all parties, but also non-partisans, he insisted.
But the chief appealed to many, especially those with whom he could exercise his supremacy.
He just shot me for a whole piece of shit.
I was thinking about a bitch, and it took me a little bit of a bitch to keep me from shooting him in the face.
But I wouldn't even go back to the streak to the potter, so that I could continue to be a runner-up officer.
What would I use for two kids?
And for that, the bar is set up!
I was in trouble, but I managed.
I won't make him happy.
"That's all so far, you can go," said the chief of the audience, and began again to look carefully at the list that he had previously had in his hand.
At 12:30 they called me.
Everyone in the office was already there, and when asked what and how, they said yes, it would be good.
Only Jo<0xC5><0xBE>in said, as was his custom, that they could not expel us all, because the work would have to be done by a co-chairman himself with his faithful, and that it would not be a threat.
The word "judgment" he emphasized, as if he knew what the old man shot me for in the morning.
There was a nice meeting in the principal's office.
The judgement of the chief at his desk and at the long consulting table was another comrade who had to decide whether or not to be my official.
Kádrovák, chairman of ROH, staff writer, special purpose referencer, something to counter the war, and vice-president, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the start.
An ordinary track worker, he sniffed a shovel or shoved a gravel with a fork.
But also a former spectator.
It was heard that there was no joke with him at the time, said a pretty beast.
The bad linguists claimed that he went to school in the seventh grade, didn't learn anything, didn't know anything.
And when the crime was abolished, he ended up on a streak by the squirrels.
But mate, yes, mate, he was fucked!
The boss told me to sit down.
There was a little nitrogen in me, an inexhaustible shackle in my neck.
Kádrovák read the assessment from the Citizens' Committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working family, I'm married, I have two children, and so on and so on.
So far it's good, I thought, and I've been breathing a little better.
Then a judgement from the party’s street organization.
He copied the judgement from the civil committee, maybe both of them were written by the same person.
But then it came!
The parents of the party members for many years refused to appear before the Inspection Commission and subsequently left the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The boss looked at me very carefully.
The bartender noticed it and stopped reading.
The officer told me that he should continue.
And then it was just worse.
I was a member of the SSM City Committee and there I was won as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who came out of the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and I had a wedding in addition to the National Committee in the church.
I've disappointed the party's confidence in the worst way.
That's why I was cut off from her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, held a church funeral, although she was a former member of the party.
All of this reflects a negative attitude towards the party’s leadership role.
When the bartender reads, only dragging the chief’s pencil into the desk interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone was looking at me honestly, and I wanted to be somewhere far away.
At the same time, I kept repeating myself in the spirit, "Communists - superhumans, communists - superhumans." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the forgers?
I was able to fix the bugs without a damn check.
But now?
The career of a runner-up officer was taken as his predecessor before it began.
Going back to the band?
I don't think that's going to work. I'm sure the chief will leave me for an hour.
"Judge, how did you inspect the comrade here?" interrupted the chief's silent question to the bartender.
Well, according to the judgement from the previous job.
You got him here?
Obviously, it wasn't a second time for the staff.
He was sweating on the slopes, shivering nervously, as if he had been tested himself.
He whispered loudly and handed some paper to the chief.
"She," said the chief, with a sign of vigour, which was often a foretaste of the storm.
At first glance, the praise itself, taught with honours, graduated from the Primary School, worked as a castle worker, met the norm at an average of one hundred and twenty percent.
But that's a big deal.
Where did you get that judgement, my friend?" he turned again to the bartender, who felt it was beginning to turn against him and that he might not be a bartender very soon.
This is where my partner gave it to me at the start.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came up to us, he went to the district to the band," said the bleacher.
And there are no trials required, his was a little extra, so I put him in the file.
"So, when you were in the technical function, this tsar paper was enough for you," said the chief of the drought.
The bartender was nervous and had no answer at all.
"It's okay, we'll discuss it later," the chief closed the case, and the bartender was apparently relieved.
So far, he's done it.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
All of a sudden, that's the end!
In my eyes it was dark, it was hot.
He was followed by purgatory and accusations, and I knew that I was the most resilient creature in the world who did not deserve the slightest mercy.
That by underlining the incomplete assessment I misrepresented a colleague of the pharmacy referencer, and I did not understand why the assessment was incomplete when I received it from the pharmacy in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist creature who, at the time of the construction of real socialism, promotes the rifts of religious obscurity, and even participates in them.
That, there were a lot of things I've done, or maybe I'm still doing, and quietly I prayed that it would end.
I didn't care about everything.
I didn't care if I got out of the mechanic's place.
I didn't care if they would take me that potato.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemies of the people that I was in the eyes of the chief's colleague.
"That would be enough, Chief's colleague," answered the party's president suddenly, and the chief's levity was severely interrupted.
The co-worker here made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he's done bullshit!
But he has already received his punishment!
Don't forget that, co-chef!
What could be worse for a young man than closing his door to the side for a while!
To open up to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is again worthy of our trust.
The untrained keeper spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he so recited or taught phrases from party trainings and meetings?
That is why this young companion must also get a chance from us!
Chances to prove he's changed.
And who's to give it to him, except you, the co-chef?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat misguided companion in his efforts to correct!
It's your party duty that no one can take away from you!
Actually, it's a side duty for all of us, too.
Here the co-worker must see that the party has not forgotten him.
As a kind mother, she not only punishes, but also loves.
When the president was finished, no one was reading.
No one expected such a reversal of the situation.
At least me.
"I totally agree with you, Co-Chairman," the chief glacially attracted in an attempt to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me talk, you'd hear that I'm just heading to that conclusion.
They all agreed to shake their heads, but they could see that they did not believe a word.
"So I was confirmed to be a separate referent for basic means care," I sighed when I returned to the office, and suddenly I cried.
Fortunately, except Eva's engineer, everyone was at lunch.
Those silences listened to my uncoherent outfit of fresh experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I was done, I asked if I could have coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put the water on the stove and cooked the pots.
In the meantime, she talked about pharmacy practices.
As one judgement, often full of praise, they hand over to a man, and the other, in which there is some dirt, they send to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was, but at the front of the batsmen, so the factory colleagues didn't know where to send it.
What about our bartender?
He only cares where he eats or drinks, and so it ends up as it ends up.
"It's been a long time since then," she pointed out.
I'm sure he won't taste it tonight.
Look out for him anyway, he's pretty handsome.
What about the party president?
Essentially, a far worse chief, no people.
Zero from a potter with great power.
The water for the coffee started to boil, and soon the office filled with the smell of coffee just sparkling.
I threw a piece of sugar in the pot and silently mixed a hot scent.
I think I'm the worst out there.
They don't fire me now, and I'll have more checks in three years.
Anyway, my co-director won't forget that day.

The symbol of the village heals.
The windshield wheel over Chlum revolves over the years.
It can be seen from a distance because it is located on a fifteen-metre high cone.
People from around the world call it the "Chlum Wind".
For the village of 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal sign, which the village acquired on the occasion of the collapse of the relatives in 2010.
"We asked for a sign at the time, and we wanted to have the windshield on the sign, of course, everyone knows it in the area," Mayor Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Ma<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
The Chlumske wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is a bit of a reminder of the present: it reminds us of the time when the people here fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries has been a rarity.
It was not until 1910 that the Clumsian representatives decided on a solution that would then be suitable until the mid-1980s.
In the village near the branch in Chichiov, they let a seven-metre deep well dig.
Three years later, the well was supplemented by a metal structure with a wind pump that pumped water into a reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranic in Moravia at a cost of 2,400 kroner," says the memorial inscription on the ground fence of the concrete structure.
The pump, after several repairs and the fall of the wind turbine, was completed in 1971.
Then, on May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the struggle for water began to be written: on that day, a new pipeline began to be used in Chlum.
The wind pump has remained only a non-functional general symbol and a rarity here.
The Dominant was run by this year's clash of relatives.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlum<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> decided to repair the wind turbine again and put it into service again.
They made a replica of the original wheel - reduced by half a meter in diameter.
The wheel was placed on the cone, but had to be brought down that same year.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose the appropriate material and the wheel was not able to resist the pores of the wind.
Then the clumsy dominance rested for several years, disguised under the roof.
From June this year, however, the bike is rotating on the high cone again.
On the occasion of the collapse of the relatives, the village allowed the replica of the bike to be edited and again placed it on the top of the iron tower.
But the wheel pumps utility water from the well only to the collapsing blind shoulder.
And over the summer we completely disconnected it because there was little water in the well.
At least it was empty-handed.
"In the autumn, we will reconnect the shaft of the wind turbine from the pump in the suction basket," Ma<0xC5><0xA1>ek explained.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the wind turbine has reached the town mark, but it is the only one of this kind in the whole Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina region.
They have a similar element in the sign in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovic and Green Mountains in Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsk, in Ku<0xC5><0xBE>elov in Hodoninsk, in Partutovic in P<0xC5><0x99>erov or in the Police in Vsetinsk.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafat, confessed to Tripolis Goian.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone else in my career," Goian, 34, smiled at a pre-match press conference.
We were trained by Georghe Hagi at the time, it was a pity that we lost.
I hope I'm going to score a goal for Sparta.
Only with the difference that we won’t lose this time,” Goian continued.
It is this man who has played 60 matches for the Romanian team that is the key support of the Greek team.
As a tracker, he will face the attacks of the Spartan offensive.
There will be a few thousand people, no hell, says of the Greek struggle of the Spartan Hyb<0xC5><0xA1>.
And partially guess what he can expect on Thursday night.
I know Fataie well who played in Romanian Aster with my brother Lucian.
At that time, I saw all of their matches.
“I know he’s a very good striker, that’s why he went to Sparta, too,” Goian said.
He did not nominate the other footballers of the Prague club, so there was a direct question whether he also knew David Lafat, the best shooter in Czech league history and captain of the Sparta.
Goian smiled and, with an easy-to-read look, addressed the Czech journalist.
The unspeakable expression in his face marked: "Why are you asking me this?"
After a moment of silence, he dropped.
We've seen some videos and I've noticed that Sparta plays a lot on the team.
He has really good players.
What about Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don't know anyone but Fatai.
The Spartans know very well about Goian.
"He has experience from major clubs, it can be said that he holds the defense of Asteras, that's how they organize the game," said Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian already has the best years in a row, but he can boast of a very interesting football resume.
During his time, Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City, were interested in him, but from Steauy he headed to Palermo, Italy, and played for the Glasgow Rangers.
We are waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, plays European cups regularly, is about winning in the Czech league.
He’s my favorite in this game, but we’re playing at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am at peace with the Slovak goalkeeper Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Ko<0xC5><0xA1>icky, who is looking forward to the competition from the Czech Republic.
Yeah, me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entry to the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland due to trading shares of the company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the group’s headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far within the project are predominantly legal and administrative and have no actual impact on the company, says Daniel Bury<0xC5><0xA1>, financial director of Kofola Group.
"In connection with the move of the group's headquarters, shareholders are considering the placement of shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to admission to the Prague Securities Exchange, the company is completing a securities prospectus, which will be submitted to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding office and related transfers of shares will be made in the form of an unofficial transaction with the participation of only existing shareholders.
As part of this operation, therefore, no shares will be offered to the public or to new investors.
"A possible offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders so decide - later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016," the company said.
The company has already stated in the past that any offer of shares could consist of issuing new shares or selling existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of Czech Television's objectivity in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the reports of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time broadcast the main news session of Czech Television.
How did she resist?
Once journalists teach at the faculty about how the media can manipulate reality, they can launch today's broadcast of Czech Television Events.
The migration crisis was devoted to about 80% of the reporting.
It was not until the first minute when the <0xC4><0x8C>T reported unrest on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks on policemen called them euphemistically to be patient - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), the current pro-immigrant propaganda was already going on.
Criticism of non-governmental organizations – a large space for non-profit organizations criticizing ill-treatment of migrants.
Syrian children at the Czech School - a story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Refugee travel - <0xC4><0x8C>T consistently uses the terms of a fugitive or fugitive, not a migrant.
The most striking thing is that <0xC4><0x8C>T consistently uses only images for young children and women.
In the same broadcast, she said that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda that has no periods of communist agitation.
I must say that as a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once climbed into a pantry apartment, I soon ceased to be the only resident.
I had fishes moving to the backyard toilet.
The domestic fish, an insect with an imperfect transformation, i.e., the non-proliferating rebirth from the pond to the brook and the young, looks like an adult individual, it is only small and gradually grows.
They were disgusting to me and I didn't swallow them.
First by hand and later by chemicals.
The Socialist drugstore provided some blue crystals to eradicate them.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
However, it successfully eliminated it.
Later, I treated the pharaohs the same way.
A box with some kind of juvenilizer that the ants brought into the nest and then he did not allow the queen to generate a new offspring.
But I turned it around.
As time went on, insects became the object of my admiration, and I became more and more inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as us humans.
In addition, I have taken from my life the experience that interference in the ecosystem does not lead to success and one pest can replace another.
The truth about fleas and puppies, I don't think I'd get discouraged by killing them.
In the new residence, my partner and I agreed that if we don’t have fish sticking around our necks, let them eat scraps of garbage, some of the invisible scars, and the like.
Their quiet existence was disrupted by the spider over time.
It was a common kind of hunter who sat on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought he lived from occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Since he has lived with us for several years, we have found that he feeds mainly on fish and that their numbers seem to have been kept at a feasible number.
With regular contact, we found out that it was a female at every need.
In fact, we were witnessing romantic remarks with a partner about a third smaller, how cautiously heeding the spider’s fibers, so that he would not be eaten before he reaches the exhausted copulation.
It took about three days when they didn’t move and didn’t even respond to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love games were played, we later found the remains of the dried female next to the female.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was already behind us, we were surprised by the number of small spiders hanging around her.
They disappeared soon.
The work was eaten by my mother, the work was scattered elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared somewhere after a week.
Whether she went somewhere else or fell asleep, we don't know, but after a month, two, she showed up on the ceiling again.
True, a little bit smaller, probably the daughter of that toilet resident.
For a while, she carefully observed our behavior from the ceiling and, moving under the toilet bowl, evaluated our non-attack as a friendship.
The number of slightly multiplied fishes has again decreased, and the spider looked at its usual activities to provide food.
Our ecosystem hasn’t changed in a year.
In the meantime, our daughter has grown to an age when the use of a nightclub has already been a shame.
We have tolerated it so far, but we have already eaten the eternal spilling of its contents.
We challenged her more and more strongly to use the toilet.
However, her daughter found an excuse to keep her bad habit in the spider she saw very well when she was beating.
Our talk about seeing the spider, having luck in the house didn't take it at all.
With tears and tears she forced her nightmare.
There was nothing left.
There was a time when the spider, in the interest of the daughter's developmental movement, had to float.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a glass and displayed through the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I had sex with him like a friend, but after so long a life together, I felt ugly as if I was throwing out a relative.
We assumed that the ponds would start to appear more often and begin to multiply by a geometric row.
The world was amazing, a week, two, none of us were there.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I was wondering if the spider in the form of the ants hadn't grown there in any way that the environment of the toilet was not as favorable for their existence as we thought.
But then the first medium-sized pieces appeared, and they had already slipped back.
I had to come up with a different theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I realized that their connection to the spider must have been because if they don't see it, it's hidden somewhere else and they're in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some telepathic connection with their predator, and his rapid disappearance in them triggered some alarming reaction.
It's better that I don't have any illusions about their eyes.
They showed some light scaryness, but that they would respond to hand grinding or quick movements, that's not.
My daughter is going to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's already forgotten about the nightclub.
All we have to do is attract a spider again.
I'm already sending my wishes to ether and I hope they didn't hate me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use that Cyclone B.
The 10 words of Albert Einstein that enriched the world.
The statements of a brilliant scientist from the last century seem to never cease to fascinate humanity.
He was able to dive so deeply into everything that the result was always an astonishing discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the most prominent scientists of all time.
He first came to the human consciousness of his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic ratio.
Its clarification of the photo effect or the idea of quantifying the electromagnetic field cannot be ignored.
There is no doubt that the description and system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is so complex for many that it is preferable to choose simple diameters for closer acquaintances.
However, it is not easy.
However, it would not have been Albert Einstein if he hadn’t found a brilliantly simplified explanation for this: A clock near your sweetheart seems a minute; a minute in the hot oven seems an hour – and that’s relativity.
I have allowed myself from all his plays of famous quotes to choose these ten, which have literally captured me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, geniuses try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of experiments can ever prove that I was right.
However, the only one can prove at any time that I was wrong.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudices.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in mind, what then reflects an empty table?
I don't know what to fight in World War III, but in the fourth there will be clacks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem that would depend on my life, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand income tax.
In conclusion, I cannot forgive not putting Einstein’s formula on the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula applies: A<0x3D>X<0x2B>Y<0x2B>Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is holding the tongue behind the teeth.
New and modern.
Hospitals in Zlín Region are expected to change by 1.5 billion.
"It's a success when we consider that all four are kept in black numbers this whole year," said Hejtman Stanislav Mi<0xC5><0xA1>ák.
The total profit of the regional facilities at the moment is about 32 million kronor.
The share in this is mainly higher than the insurance companies, which are equally favorable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford to invest more.
In Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>, Vsetín, Uherske Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> and Zlín<0xC4><0x9B>, this is due to the construction, which together will cost almost 1.5 billion kroner.
The long period of time when we bought mainly instruments was over.
Now we need to start building new buildings, because without them, the top health care can not be done, the regional deputy for health Lubomír Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as justified the plans.
We look forward to changes in all hospitals.
The builders will be in hospitals next year.
In Vsetín, the suppliers of the new interior pavilion are now selecting for almost 300 million SEK.
In Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>, they have a planned harbor of dialysis.
Hradi<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>e Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> wants to build a new interior for about 200 million people to the central pavilion that opened this year.
And the Zlín Bat<0xC5><0xA5> hospital is long awaiting the deferred construction of a new central and internal revenue, which will require three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are the most significant and often major changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the entire region, patients and doctors," said V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Prousková, the internal director of the hospital in Vestin.
The five-story building is expected to be completed in about two years and offers comfortable equipment for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, bed and intensive care unit.
More comfort for patients.
Changes that are particularly well known to patients affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many patients lie in one room, only need one toilet on the floor, the beds are insulated, the windows are insulated, and the health care providers do not have adequate working conditions.
“For example, our interior was built thirty-five years ago and is now on the brink of its lifespan,” said Pavel Calabek, director of the Zlín hospital.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected with an emergency income.
Doctors and patients will have all the emergency departments in one place, in addition, in new premises.
The same model has already half finished the Hungarian Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
The central income is already in place, and within three years it will be internal.
“We will pay off the loan and partly from our own funds,” said Petr Sládek, CEO.
It is this hospital that can afford its own funding as the only one in the region.
The profit is still the highest and it did not get to loss even two years ago, when, for example, the Zlin hospital faced a loss of almost two million.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, increase income and efficiently manage costs across the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who has the economy in charge.
Improvements are also awaited by patients at the Cromer Hospital.
Within ten to fifteen years, it will take up to half a billion crowns for repairs, new appliances and reconstructions.
Already this year, the repair of the capture station will be completed, then the construction of the dialysis port, or the construction of the building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one told me how to keep refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (CSSD) has complained after meeting with his European colleagues that the other Czech states are pushing to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but they refuse any discussion.
He also notes that no one has explained to him yet how to keep allocated refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us anyway.
“We didn’t get an answer, and that’s why we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text,” Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position with which you came to the meeting of the Ministers for the Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as with a system that simply cannot work.
We can't talk about migrants like bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have some visions, they are heading somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we are able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they were to redistribute themselves.
We can't imagine it.
We did not get an answer and therefore we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with this.
We’ve been talking about this for a year and say that this is the way.
But to say that the quotas will solve everything?
Recently we solved forty thousand, now it's one hundred twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in the area?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
We have the ambition to go to other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as their destination country, obtain asylum from us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is limited to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees don't even want to come to us, but we have already committed to accepting fifteen hundred people.
Wouldn’t it be possible to take more of them this way?
We are committed to accepting 1,500 people, but on condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operations.
Even those 1,500 are going to lose 1,100 people with whom we will handle the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility and we'll treat them the same as the ones we caught.
It is a big question, and we will discuss it with Europe, whether we can hold people who will be registered in Italy, Greece, or Hungary.
Because Europe behaves in such a way that if they are registered, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, it may happen that we will not hold even the 1100 in the territory of the Czech Republic and they will leave again after arriving in Germany.
If we are able to detain them during the asylum procedure, we will handle the asylum procedure with them.
If Syrians, Eritrea, are citizens, then almost 98 per cent of European statistics are granted international protection.
They will then receive documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will relocate.
This is the second project that is underway, and there we have only progressed in debating with the churches about the possibility that they can help them find jobs, housing, and so on.
But it's a run on a very long track.
You said that the other states were not willing to discuss the ministerial talks with us.
Is it not true that the Czech Republic simply rejects quotas, but does not offer any solidarity action that would unblock the discussion?
And what exactly do you think this is a solidary step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany expresses an incentive for all migrants from Syria to reach them, the message is spread in rows of hours across all camps across Europe, as well as in Turkey, Jordan.
This calls for another wave of migration that is heading to Germany because they simply do not want to come to us.
We believe that the road is to protect the external borders - just discourage those migration waves, help the needy, and separate economic migrants.
Clearly, let them know that they have no chance.
Last year alone, 50,000 Kosovars arrived in Germany.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including the police, courts, state prosecutors.
If we managed to separate them and not accept them, or only accept them according to the needs of the economy, then those fifty percent of what the social systems spend on them today could go to refugees.
In contrast to the first day Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day it's twelve.
Where is it going to be so that border controls are tightened?
We were afraid of arresting hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred vacancies in stone detention facilities.
Of course, we will return all the people we detain, we will return to Austria within seven days.
We do it standard.
The Raku<0xC5><0xA1>ans are the only ones who take these people to us, with Hungary it's complicated and the Greeks - it's a completely useless story.
So where's the breaking point?
Should it be a thousand a day?
I think it should be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three consecutive days, are exhausting our capacity enough to make emergency plans happen.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an emergency government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in contact by phone several times a day.
If the situation arises, the government can de facto sit down immediately and, by one resolution, it would decide to strengthen the police about the army, let's give it to the customs administration, or about prison service.
The regional variant is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think we can get that far.
Please note that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen in order for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I do not want to spread alarming information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia or Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians are trying to avoid the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would have a very marginal impact, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of the debt at the last minute.
They are trying to prevent the declaration of bankruptcy.
Soccer Slavia paid off her debts.
Soccer players are also looking forward to their money.
Soccer Slavia took place on Tuesday for the first time due to insolvency proceedings in court.
Almost three months after the proposal was submitted by Online Services from Pacific Samoa for about 20 million kroner.
Slavia’s lawyer Zuzana Mladková tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlova within a few hours that she did not have to declare a failure over Slavia.
And I have to say, she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week a large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and Czech billionaire Ji<0xC5><0x99>í <0xC5><0xA0>imán<0xC4><0x9B> became the new owner of Slavia.
Obviously, the new owners brought the money to the club at the last minute.
This is also evidenced by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's court hearing - the top club on Monday, just the day before the court hearing, sent tens of millions of kroner in debt.
"Everything was paid between September 11 and September 15," said Slavia Mladková, a lawyer.
To whom did Slavia pay?
For both current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivanovi or the Czech backer Maria Li<0xC4><0x8D>kovi.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexandr Losenick.
On Friday, the club also paid debt fees to the district of Prague 10.
As part of the insolvency dispute, only the claims that Slavie dispute remain de facto.
Either, according to the club, the obligations in question have not arisen at all, or they are subject to legal disputes.
However, we are prepared to pay the amount in case of loss of such disputes.
"We have the necessary funds on the bank account, which we can prove with a statement from the account," Mladková, a lawyer, said.
"Everything that was paid after the due date is paid," Mladková said, adding that only invalid or disputed liabilities are not reserved.
It is also certain that in the coming days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid off the aforementioned debts.
Subsequently, all the evidence will be evaluated.
The decision can therefore be expected at the earliest in November.
The judge ordered the continuation of the hearing on November 3rd.
However, the decision does not fall even at this meeting, but only in writing after it.

FastMig X represents the latest generation of inverter welding sources.
The combination of state-of-the-art technologies, hardware and software equipment integrated into the modular design brings benefits and rapid return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
And whatever, from welding of structural steel to welding of special alloys, as well as from welding of rough materials to welding of thin sheets, from applications in workshops to welding in shipyards.
Unbelievable amounts of welding curves, easy setup and expandability of the welding source allow you to quickly react to the change of requirements, resulting in a reduction in stagnations, the need to switch the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding through cutting-edge welding processes developed by Kemppi to ensure higher productivity and welding quality.
It stops wasting time and there is no waste of material or repair of faulty welding.
Flexibility is ensured, there is less stagnation, more welding and higher profits.
This year’s news premiered in Nitra, where she also won a gold medal.
We greatly appreciate these qualities, as they confirm the uniqueness of the product.
Leading world-class manufacturers can boast of similar systems, but thanks to the difference in software and parameters management, FastMig X is one of the world’s leading manufacturers.
For the interested parties, the delivery deadlines are also pleasant, which range from about three weeks.
In the Czech Republic we have already established the first contacts, which will certainly expand after the Brno fair.
We have been its regular participants for more than twenty years and almost always after it our business results are better than before, emphasizes ARC-H Miroslav Streichsbier, the head of the Kemppi store in Pilsen.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
The blank was to be built so that it did not fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
The blanket was even more secure, the expert says.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built so as not to cause two landslides in Prague’s Stromovce, says the production director of Satra, who is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
He said it on Wednesday night during a journalistic inspection of the tunnel.
But he said it would cost about half a billion kroner.
The drivers will open on Saturday afternoon.
It is always a compromise between price and safety.
"The tunnel was going to be torn down more safely, but the costs are growing exponentially," Butovi<0xC4><0x8D> said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovce were the same all the time, yet the country collapsed just a few steps from the place from which he began to tear up by a safer and more cautious method.
“If the measure were used 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive,” Butovi<0xC4><0x8D> said.
The Blanka Tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was formed in Stromovce, in 2010 the soil collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of the company Metrostav Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlava, the tunnel is unnecessaryly expensive, he told the Euro weekly.
The building was originally intended to cost 17 billion crowns.
When we add VAT, which has doubled during the construction period, you have twenty-one of seventeen billion.
Adding to this technology, land purchases and engineering activities, valuations and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is not so far from the 37 again, B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlav said.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.
iOS 9: How to Get a New iPhone with a New Apple Update
A new operating system may be requested in Settings by clicking the "General" tab and selecting "Software Update".
When it is ready, it will offer you the option to download your phone and then install it.
Some users encountered a problem after the installation, specifically the error message “software update failed”.
One solution to this problem is to wait for an update to occur or try it through iTunes.
Your phone will carry you through the update process.
And this includes the need to uninstall applications to free up space - it won't be necessary, however, because Apple reduced the update and also facilitated the entire process thanks to the use of a special utility, which suggests the user to delete and reinstall applications after the update ends.
Make sure that your phone is charged before you start the update.

FedEx’s mixed profits, fiscal outlook cuts for 2016
FedEx has reported unsatisfactory results over the past quarter and a massive decline in year-round profit forecasts due to low demand for freight and higher land-based costs.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company’s shares fell by about 2.5 percent in pre-trade trading 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening.
FedEx says it expects profits between <0x24>10.40 and <0x24>10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which means a 20-cent drop from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected <0x24>10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The reduced outlook comes despite an average increase in interest rates of 4.9 per cent, which will occur in January. 4, and higher surcharges for land transportation of heavy or large packages, which starts in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth from the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
The chairman of the board and CEO, Fred Smith, said the company had "represented solid performance despite weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in the manufacturing industry and global trade."
Holiday rental plans were announced the day after rival UPS said it plans to hire an additional 90,000 to 95,000 employees, which is roughly the same as it hired last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned <0x24>692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
The profit per share was <0x24>2.42, which is less than <0x24>2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose 5%, to <0x24>12.3 billion.
Six analysts asked by Zacks expected <0x24>12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping, causing revenues in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has strengthened the results of the FedEx land unit.
In the last quarter, land revenues increased by 29 percent, but operating profits were essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher basic rates, while profits fell in the freight trade due to higher labour-power prices.
In pre-trade trading about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell by <0x24>3.85, or 2.5 percent, to <0x24>150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a 11% fall in the year and 17% below the June 11 record.
At their most anticipated session in years, Federal Reserve legislators will spend two days this week sitting at the 27-foot-long Honduran mahogany table and will decide whether it’s time to raise the key interest rate after almost a decade.
Sticking over them at one end of the central bank ornament, the two-story meeting room will be a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the nation’s economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: maximize U.S. employment and keep its prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have recognized that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be the X-factor in too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday about whether the U.S. economy is ready to launch when it drops from an unprecedented stimulus in the form of a near-zero consecutive 2008 shortcut.
Although most data shows solid growth in the economy, recent turbulence in the world’s financial markets could already frighten the cautious Fed due to the addition to instability by increasing its reference rate of federal funds – and not more than just a percentage of the country’s share.
“It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think they were just looking for a pretext not to increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives them enough reason to wait further,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of nervousness in the financial markets.
Approximately half of economists polled recently by Blomberg predicted a rate increase this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to delay the matter, with a key indicator of only about 30% chances of an increase.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed would raise rates only if politicians softened the decline by promising that another increase is inconsiderate.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industry average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The meeting was triggered by expectations that the Fed’s politicians will slow rates this week quietly, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be a surprise if the Fed now raise rates,” he said.
If the Fed politicians did so, “they would have to go to extremes in their program statement and keep the financial markets in hand so as not to panic.”
Other experts have argued that rising rates would calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed will proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be on the right track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in slowing down currency conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
Yellen said that over the spring and early summer she expects rates to rise this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, this year’s labour market saw strong growth.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and is close to what the Fed considers full employment.
The salary gains showed signs of an increase.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, the Fed’s politicians claim that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy “is able to cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness in the labour market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to decline at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones’ industrial average fell by up to 16% below its record value in May, when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would drag global growth down.
The market declined slightly this month and the Dow is now losing just about 10% of the May peak.
The unrest in the market provides the Fed’s political actors with a comprehensive calculation of when to calculate an increase in interest rates.
“With the absence of what has happened in the financial markets, and reports of China’s economic weakness in the past few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, lead researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former executive officer.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to get better control over the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what impact it will have on the U.S. economy, and there's almost no data they could rely on about the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health status of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so it should technically not be included in their decision-making.
But in fact, the Fed has become the currency authority of the whole world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The slight hint of then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “shoot” their monetary expansion on the market has sparked clashes around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly closely interconnected, it is expected that Fed officials will also monitor developments elsewhere, but they will also consult with other central bankers and experts so that they can better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is “more of art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth-management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that “the Fed has a history of over-movement in financial markets that seem unrelated to economic foundations.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who pushed for higher rates, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its reference rate by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings "despite limited identifiable impacts on U.S. growth," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should prioritize concerns about financial stability only during a major crisis, such as the market collapse in 2008, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England's rate setting committee.
The latest warming is not even approaching this level, he said.
“You certainly don’t want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because the markets have become angry,” said Posen, president of the Institute for International Economics Peterson.
The Federal Reserve System Act has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in the Chinese Quarter.
Yes, the Chinese Quarter
The market/storage was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's the Chinese Quarter, not the Thai Quarter.
The market/storage is the only contact point that offers an astonishing range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian dishes, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There is even a car part available if you need some engine oil.
The shop is massive and it will take you over an hour before you cross all the streets.
If you’re hungry for all this shopping, go for a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading booth (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various pick-up locations.
What's in stock: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
You will probably find it in LAX-C.
Items are inexpensive and lots of items are sold in bulk.
Fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The extension of meat is great, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash and drain you, even squeeze it, if you want it,
A good part of the store is left to the massive freezing section, where you will find frozen cauliflower leaves, bitter melon and gallon, whole cabbage, fish, beef blood and gall, pork intestine, fish balls, regional sausages, free-market semi-finished goods and more.
Who shops here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also separate families and individuals.
Wide alleyways run along shopping carts and lift trucks.
Find: Fresh Monthong durian next to the safe.
Where it is located: The store is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounded by the suburbs of Chinatown and the center - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking space that shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store may be busy, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the highways will remain at the old.
The acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected by the House.
On selected sections of the motorway, it will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed to 150 km/h under favorable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House decided to vote on the Senate's amendment, which rejected the increase in speed.
The new law on terrestrial communications is now aimed at the president.
At the end of April, President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman said he would veto the law allowing the speed of a foot of ten kilometres.
Transport Minister Dan <0xC5><0xA4>ok (for ANO) was also against the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network is not built for such a speed yet.
On Tuesday, the Senate voted in favour of the bill.
In line with the original governmental proposal, the Novel will now allow speed increases from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-speed roads.
The House initially extended this option to highways, which could be used in selected sections at speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
MEPs have now agreed to his proposal.
The senators, with the consent of the Minister of Transport from the novel, also excluded the permission of the transport police to have the last word when editing local communications that the municipalities take care of.
The Senate version approved by the House also counts on the possibility of sewerage, waterways or public lighting cables being stored along the surface of the carriages.
Thus, the municipalities would save on the purchase of land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the land in question.
The novel is also intended to help improve road protection and make it easier for municipalities to load off-road vehicles to which owners do not report.
The municipalities could sell rebound vehicles, which will not be registered by their owners within six months of notification of the rebound.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight transport through their territory on the roads of the second and third classes under the threat of a fine as well for shipping companies.
The new law also abolishes the possibility of introducing electronic highway marks instead of existing paper marks, which will be used even after 1 January next year.
According to the government, it will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The oral expressor goes to court.
He is threatened by 10 years of overwhelming welcome from citizens.
The case concerns the allegedly overburdened Citizens Welcome project.
The police wanted to prosecute Zuzan Kailov (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in this case, but the House of Representatives did not release her.
According to the legal qualifications of the case, both are threatened with up to 10 years in prison.
The main event is currently scheduled for two days in October.
According to Prosecutor Mandik and Macík, at least one million crowns have been damaged, according to the complaint.
The plaintiff is based on an expert assessment.
Former members of the city’s management, according to the prosecutor’s office, unauthorizedly allowed the property benefit of the company that organised the citizens’ welcome.
Man<0xC3><0xBD>k, according to the complaint to the then head of the magistrate department of urban services, education and culture, ordered to address five connected companies in the selection process.
When another company, which offered the lowest price, signed up for the contest, the City Council canceled the contest.
The contract was then entrusted by the city to the administrator, and only Darothore was admitted to the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid at least one million more.
Both accusations were conducted with the aim of ensuring that Darothore was awarded a public contract to organise the Citizens’ Welcome event in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem for a long time and coordinatedly acted at least in violation of the request for the procedure to care for the proper manager.
At the same time, he said they were aware that Darothore would subsequently charge <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem for the realization of the Welcome of the Citizens price, which would be disproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, the company reportedly collected more than five million crowns for the project.
Eventually, the city paid only one part, about 1.7 million kroner, and then resigned from the contract.
The amount paid was exaggerated by at least one million kroner according to the expert assessment.
Mandek has previously rejected any violations of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I do not understand this constructed cause, said the former mayor in the past, with the city under his leadership only linked to a similar project from previous years.
The event was hosted by Roxy II from 2008 to 2010.
"It was on the same terms, on the same money," Mandik added.
The criminals initially wanted to accuse Ms Kail, who was also a member of the city council.
But the House of Representatives did not hand her over to prosecution.
The criminals therefore postponed the case in her case, but hoped that Kaila would be charged after her parliamentary term expired.
The welcome of the citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
At the time, the mothers received a gift cheque for 5,000 crowns to buy children’s necessities and small gifts.
Hungarian police allegedly fired a dog on a fugitive.
Then they forced the reporters to delete the record.
Hungarian police said on the border with Serbia briefly arrested the AP cameraman and forced him to delete a record on which the police dog allegedly crashed into the country of the refugee.
The Hungarian government, however, doubts this accusation.
The alleged incident took place on Saturday evening when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing the maize field near the Hungarian city of Röszke.
The fugitives were attacked by police, and one of them was attacked by a Syrian dog with a basket on a shovel.
The dog of the man who shouted, "Please, please, I'm a refugee," he whispered, Muzi says.
The fact that Muzi was filming everything, he noticed one of the cops and didn't let him go.
The journalist was no longer allowed to call either his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
The Muzi police took him to a dark spot near the refugee registration centre and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then he was ordered to erase the record.
Muzi thus lost the result of his two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt he was in danger because the dogs were nearby.
AP sent a letter of protest to Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
The behavior of the policemen in it was unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover the events without risking physical violence and not be afraid that the government will destroy legally acquired material.
Kovács, with reference to the police report of Muzio's outline of the events, questioned.
He said the police just wanted the reporter to show them whether they were on some footage they were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to shave.
"Dogs can kick - they're trained to scare and scare a little, but they certainly don't attack," Kovács says.
Unpredictable Champions League.
Winning the City will knock us down, Juventus believes
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, coach at home City.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League game.
None of the teams made up a lot of opportunities, but we had the ball on the dungeons longer.
"The reason for the defeat was not in the tactics, Juventus just shot two beautiful goals," Pellegrini said in a 636-minute match.
Last season’s finalist, Juventus, was on the opposite side – after the first three rounds of the Italian league, he has only a point to defend the title and a 2:4 score to 16th place in the table.
That’s why the turn to Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will catch us," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three opponents before the new year - Pirla, Téveze and Vidal.
In Manchester they represented Pogba, Manjuki<0xC4><0x8D> and Morata.
"That's right, this win is very important, maybe it will lead us to the winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we rank among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the attacking phase.
This is the result my players deserve.
“Before our goal we could have scored 0:2, but Gianluigi supported us,” Allegri, coach of goalkeeper Buffon, said.
"We burned a few good chances," said Yayu Touré, City's backer.
We have to take from the Champions League of experience and try to get a better result next time.
Goodbye Angelo, goodbye to old Germany II.
Before we move on to the issue of immigrants, we should realize that all this media friction around is managed by professionals.
According to the needs of the media as well as the seshora.
So let's stop for a moment.
Today, the newspapers and media are full of children who carry on their parents’ hands the dusty journeys of the Exodus.
And this automatically induces a sense of guilt and compassion in man - that is, in the European man.
Well, they don't just come here with desperate little ones, notice on the landing boats to the Greek islands that the little ones aren't so much to see on them!
Well, somehow, we have recently disappeared from television with pictures of ships heading to Lampedusa, the refugees outside the French border near Menton, whose beautiful promenades lie by thousands of young men.
Most of the young blacks.
And also disappeared pictures from Callais, where these eat and the black men wait for them to get through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think he knows that anymore.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian church of Eritreans did not make a special impression on the inhabitants of Europe.
Too much of a fake thing.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it’s somehow hidden that it’s not just about unhappy children from Syria, but also about the prominent – for the elderly: fashionable – young men.
Their muscles look like they're just coming from some fitness center.
There is only one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we were lying on the hotel's private beach.
Despite the fact that it was private, suddenly a large group of cars came to the beach.
But no ham.
The young blacks came out of them.
Approximately thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They went to the beach, all the clothes in branded clothes and boots. In the hands, like otherwise, smartphones.
That this is a private beach, it didn’t matter and the employees – the Turks, the Muslims! – were obviously afraid of them.
They occupy all the beds.
Those who weren’t in the sea and were in the sea had a bad time.
They were dressed like American rapper movies.
On the heads of the hat with a nail, white and colorful adidas on the legs.
Then they surrounded the local beach bar and started hiking.
They sat around the chairs, sat next to the dinner table and white guests at the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children ran away from the dining terrace somewhere quietly.
The coming blacks drank beer from a third of them – as in U.S. series?! – they threw empty bottles around the beach.
They kept screaming loudly at each other.
It wasn't in English, though.
Then they went to drink wine, also straight out of the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in branded swimsuits, especially the young ladies -, yelled and yelled in the water, mothers and children and pensioners fled frightened, and in half an hour there was not a single black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They're all gone.
Regardless of whether he was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to talk about them.
The reader said to me half-heartedly in the evening, "Have you seen the gold they were wearing?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they definitely didn't have it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, everyone had a massive gold chain around their necks.
And one had about twenty centimeters of massive gold cross on his neck.
Women were like goldfish.
"Are they drug smugglers?" I asked.
"You've seen them cool down," said the waiter.
Drugs don't hurt, they don't use.
They're cheating on something completely different.
So I knew what they were doing.
However, in June 2105, it was not so important to me.
I didn't know what was going to happen next.
But the secret services and top politicians should know it first.
I don't think they'd know.
About 1.5 million immigrants were evacuated to Europe at the time.
They're going to go.
Today it turned out that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-corrective politicians, like intellectuals, and associated lobbyists and economically important groups, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - the now publicly recognized main force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only those, but also the EU and TV leaders, including ours.
For example, recent television images of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of Moscow television footage from August 1968.
Sure, there were a few sunsets at the station, but most importantly - the Old Germans - the Muslims welcomed their compatriots.
For many weeks, they have been bluffing in news on Czech television, as Germans say, according to some research, almost everyone is in favor of the arrival of emigrants.
However, those who have only been in Germany for a few days know that it is a lie like a tower.
Which is confirmed by further information.
For example, a famous public opinion survey organized by the ARD - Czech Association of Public Rights Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to the ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to take up more refugees a week ago.
It was also reported by our television.
However, they hid what broke out in Germany the next day: that 94.5 percent of Germans found that they no longer want immigrants – 67,000 people participated in the polls.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly stated in November 2010, five years ago, "Our attempt at 'multi-culti' society has completely failed."
She continued, "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All attempts to coexist like this have completely failed."
In a country where there are four million Muslims, she said that a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live next to each other without being integrated has not been proven. Today they live here with us and we have for some time insisted that they will not be left behind again one day.
That's not real.
A multicultural approach where we say we just live happily next to each other, so this approach has failed.
Absolutely failed.
But even Merkel may not have the strength to go against the powerful Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
This shows the escalation of events.
Conflict is growing rapidly.
Euro-German Schulz, President of the European Parliament, SPD Member, the only one who is not supposed to have a degree in the European Parliament - yes, that's the one Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said he could play a superintendent at a concentration camp from a minute onwards - has appeared on several occasions.
It seems, especially under the impression of the last statements of German politicians, that Germany has surpassed Rubicon.
We note that, except for some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the nationals of countries that were victims of Nazism are frightened.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful, and solid Germans?
Who for years tried, at least externally, to deal with their horrific past of the aggressor and killer of millions?
Are those who say that in Germany there is a devil in the soul of aggression, superiority and violence?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he put an end to the attempts of the Great Nazis to control the whole of Europe?
When did he say that the great-German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When she was suspended, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Greater Germany, which led Germany and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably returned in another form.
After the attempt of the Marxists to control the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the NDR, in Germany, for example, on the basis of ecology, which was by the way one of the main ideological doctrines of Nazism, a new German ideology began to develop.
We'd say sunshine.
The German elites have for a long time defended the emergence of German nationalism, leaving all those warriors against the atom, enthusiasts looking for a paradise for all, silently supporting the old imperial and Nazi motto Our Forest must live.
In order to satisfy restless young people all over the world who want to do something different and better, they fully leaned to the side of the warriors against global warming, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that in this current there is also a strong anti-Semitic – so-called pro-Palestinian – and anti-Slovak current that considers all Slovaks a difficult verb – since the time of Karl Marx, who, after the Jews’ parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the latest statements by Schulze and German ministers openly threatening the rebellious Eastern states show, the idea of leading Germany.
Which must be listened to without apology.
Otherwise, you're in trouble!
And when we incorporate the fact that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And there is, as always, capital, especially the German capital, to which it suits and which draws from the fact that Germany, in fact, controls most of the states of Europe through the banks and the Union.
Pseudovir of sunflowers first introduced the Germans into the basins of ecology and multiculturalism and today brought them home and will bring millions of Muslims.
Those who, seduced by the siren’s voices, soon come across a wall of reality that Merkel doesn’t want to see, and start to shake.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbors with force, once again a part of its population - but it seems to be a smaller part - ideologically, but in the end, reality will reach it as always.
Will Germany burn down again?
Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the incoming Islamists erupt?
Will Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time come to the aid, but certainly not assimilated to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalized Muslims, the incoming Islamists and the Germans, who are afraid of Islamizing their country, are allowed to enter?
What will it do with the Germans, and even with Germany, when people rise up, who will protest loudly and publicly against the new euro-middle-life Muslim?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict in Europe, which has sparked the support of the solar ideology, i.e., the ideology of the elite and, in principle, of the totalitarian, and of its uninhabited banks, is growing.
And due to the unwavering action against the disobedient democratic Germans and all the subordinate and disobedient Eastern neighbours, this cannot be done well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of insane sellers is to scare them to death.
You just have to shut down and the robust tap is tapping on you in a way that the weaker nature doesn’t have to stop.
The animated head will keep you warm and start even the dirty, on the way away will accompany (or rather start) the indispensable seller and the animated sculpture.
It’s a shame that a speaker speaker can’t even get it.
It would also be good for us to sneak up a lot of bullshit and crap.
Pink (Oxalis corniculata).
A small grass that tolerates a dry environment.
And so it's located between the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant that, although it belongs to the expansive grasses, creates a nice impression in terms of flowering.
It is located among the outdoor tiles.
It's unexplored, it's getting better in the garden.
She likes a dryer environment, is easily adaptable, modest and uncomplicated.
Although it creates sheets with chaotic composition, it is therefore worth watching and photographing further.
Under the miniature there is only the beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with a purple accompaniment.
Brazilian paediatric company Rio Grande promotes healthy breastfeeding diet
The Brazilian paediatric company SPRS has come up with a shocking way of trying to provide women with insights into the importance of a good diet when breastfeeding with images of babies stained from the breast by the display of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that supply infants with all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to excessive energy requirements, pregnant women and newly baked mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected their children’s genetic development and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets adversely affected the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates, although Nine's tries to take the lead in Today Show
With Karl Stefanovice and Lisy Wilkinson in Canberra to cover the costs of the leak of the liberal leadership, we failed to create a sufficient increase in the ratings for Today.
The early show Nine is broadcast from the national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with host David Koch and Samantha Armytage buried in London as part of a weeklong international television series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This tyranny of distance did not seem to matter so much to the audience of Aussie TV, as it recorded an average of 397,000 spectators in five major cities, compared to 330,000 spectators broadcasting Today.
Today saw a slight increase in its rating compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been filling the gap at Sunrise in recent months.
In August there were an average of 318,000 in Today compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators and Today 314,000 spectators.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened all morning.
Wind change affects more this morning than just parliament, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for your inquiry!

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with former star Packed to the Rafters Eric Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to move with his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand, has an average of very impressive 1,219 million spectators.
Critics were wondering if Thomson himself would be able to stretch the TV hit without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
Yesterday's results show a clear "yes".
The X Factor from Seven retained strong 1,136 million viewers, smoothly defeating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000)
Seven recorded mixed tracking on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half of the new TV quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30), which Andrew O'Keefe mentioned, had an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators — enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire’s Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 spectators and the second half of the incredible 720,000.
The Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Thanks to the drop in The Chase Australia ratings from the second night, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will eventually win at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Million Dollar Minute, which failed to defeat McGuir's show.

Three in the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect boy - but who will he choose?
The secret is revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally found out who won the Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood arrives at Bachelor is enveloped by an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls who will stay in the state will definitely not reveal who the real one is, who will eventually get the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they thanklessly told us who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his tongue behind his teeth until Thursday's final
All three women lyrically sang why Wood was the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, who will get Wood's final flower?", their answers could act as a spoiler regarding who will win the heart of Bachelor.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would be best suited to Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been sharing a light relationship since one day.
“From the moment I entered the house and watched the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think about it during the course,” said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really a country woman, she's a lot of fun with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry among them.
Together they are good and pleasant.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood and I could make a great couple.
She claims that during her last visit at home, she realized that Wood could be “the real one.”
“As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was not just a game anymore – I opened my heart to him now,” he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if it wasn't for her, she looked mysteriously.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I like both girls equally - it's indecisive between Snow and Lana.
Bachalor broadcasts on Wednesday at 7.30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle have shown a lot of interest after his move to the United States and many teams have been questioning after his great start to training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it looks like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches left Hayne to sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which made the conversion of the Australian rugby league on the first kick from the top of Tuesday's 20:3 win at Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and occupy him in the game after Reggie Bush’s injury.
Tomsula also continued to be honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of picking up the newbies before the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
49ers reporter Cam Inman said Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and only take care of the next game.
In the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
It certainly wasn’t the start that Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hoped for at his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught at the pitch when he accidentally left the field and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 he couldn’t even imagine a worse start to his NFL career.
“That’s what happens, you just focus on the next game and that’s the whole thing,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the trapas to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in his own branch territory led to the Queensland three.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne has posted a photo with fans, on which he holds the Australian flag after the game on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the rights of homosexuals
In 2003, the wealthiest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested for targeting guns on the Siberian ranch.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts were limited.
The U.S. stopped for emigrants who were demanding property refunds.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple applied to the state for compensation under the Extrajudicial Rehabilitation Act.
The court initially assigned them the amount requested, i.e. over 2.8 million kroner, but the appellant court changed their claim so that it granted them only less than 90 thousand kroner, with reference to the fact that the amount of the compensation is determined according to the 1991 price regulations.
Emigrants were detained by the Supreme Court and charged them with the amount originally sued.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned to the U.S. with a complaint.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic relations that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at that time, even if it was adequate in relation to the deducted property, now only reaches a fractional sum of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the weight of the side participants as in the restitution of eligible persons who have been claiming their rights at least since 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to provide compensation before," said Judge Jaroslav Fenyk, a reporter, explaining why the U.S. stood on the side of the emigrants.
"The U.S. has repeatedly pleaded for the General Courts to proceed in restitution proceedings so that any inconsistencies are not interpreted in the disfavor of the eligible persons and that the purpose of more restitution legislation, i.e. the compensation of the total property fault caused by the state court, is always achieved," he said.
Evitu in the musical Studio DVA will now be produced by Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arová.
By the way, Radka Fi<0xC5><0xA1>ar became the world’s youngest Evita when in 1998, at the age of 20, she played the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech introduction of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Timea Spiár Ricea dícea.
To return to the same role, he says, "To this day, Evita's demands for performance were unbalanced."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
In the role of Argentina's first lady, Monika Absolon recommended her.
I have seen the monk in Evita three times and it was definitely inspiring to me.
All of a sudden I saw a whole new concept here.
I am totally in favour of more modern editing, but this is just a particularly well-respected one.
"The director of Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokol is original, lightened and contemporary," says Fi<0xC5><0xA1>arová.
The conceptual transfer of the musical jazz between the two singers will take place at Monika Absolon’s Birthday Concert on September 27th from 19:00 in Studio DVA.
The evening culminates with songs from the musical Evita.
Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Don't Cry For Me Argentina) is a duet.
In a limited number of performances, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokol will also take off from the director's desk when he plays the role of President Perón during the filming of Karl Roden.
In the interest of the public, further dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech study of the world musical Evita will be launched by Studio DVA in collaboration with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London has been successful since February 2015.
Directed by Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Sokol, the main female role was originally studied by Monika Absolon.
Karel Roden appears next to her as President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strená<0xC4><0x8D>ik.
The legendary songs from Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's workshop with Czech lyrics by Michael Prost<0xC4><0x9B>jovski sound in a live orchestra under the direction of Kry<0xC5><0xA1>tof Mark, who participated already on the first appearance at the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after police fired rubber projectiles on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber projectiles at a crowd of protesters against a new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
Violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district officer, said more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of the police station and some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal says the police used tear gas and then fired it into the air before resorting to rubber missiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, which are known for their ability to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
The clash was the last week of violent demonstrations across the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group said they had established a new province under the proposed new constitution and mitigated their political influence.
Further demonstrations in western Nepal have also been recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which demands the formation of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Legislators voted in Kathmandu this week on the draft constitution, and officials said the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We mustn't panic now.
After losing on the ice of the Litvínov championship, you did not manage even a domestic match with the Sparta hockey player (3:5).
Don't you worry about a similarly disastrous entry into the extraliga as you did a year ago?
I hope nothing like this happens again.
Honourable Folk.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A wide low-lying system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands is 60 percent likely to develop a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-cost system, roughly in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, is also 60 percent likely to develop tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, a Miami-based weather forecast said.
Google has launched a campaign to raise <0x24>11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) said it would launch a campaign to raise <0x24>11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have flooded European countries in their escape from the war of rejected and poor countries.
Google announced this in a very unusual way on its blog.
The report was posted on her blog by Google employee Rita Masoud on the basis of personal experience when she fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven.
“We traveled in many dark trains and buses and we experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear,” Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families like the one they have are willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among four non-profit organizations to help refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double all contributions made via google.com/refugeelief to <0x24>5.5 million.
Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees since World War II, most of whom come from Syria, driven by the four-year war, which only kicked out 4 million people this year.
Many people are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery could be useful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether people with mildly obese type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are given non-surgical treatment.
“Death data take a long time to show,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote the initiator of a new JAMA surgery study.
Operations for weight loss, bariatric surgery use various methods to reduce the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery proved to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the study was conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body weight index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
The BMI, which measures the weight ratio related to height, is considered normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates an overweight person and people over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new study, researchers from Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a study since 2007 that deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastricectomy - in treatment procedures for type 3 diabetes in people who have had diabetes.
The average BMI among those undergoing surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
In the meantime, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment for diabetes remained approximately the same as 29.
Among the patients with surgery, diabetes was resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the drug-treated group, diabetes was completely resolved in only 1 percent and in part in only about 2 percent of patients.
Furthermore, blood pressure control, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol were shown to be “generally better in the surgical group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the continuous level of blood sugar in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, researchers say.
After surgery, the mean hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the drug-treated group, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - reflected in better levels of hemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of surgery.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrictomy group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent) and had a higher likelihood of diabetic remission (16.9 per cent).
While the new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden where they found that surgery leads to prolonged life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29 percent more likely to survive over the next 15 years, compared to a group that tested more conventional methods.
Although a new study did not show an improvement in survival among post-surgery patients, according to Blackstone it is a soothing result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
“Right here, this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a group with lower BMI,” without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also claims that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after the patient’s BMI drops between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to show people the seriousness of the situation,” he says.
I think that once you accumulate these genetic changes, which strongly link their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not capable of capturing all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He argued that under the present circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in solving the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
“Becoming a few thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries,” he said.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing the issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also spoke about the charges against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that "the violent response of the United States has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent way.
I know his motives were good, but he used his strength and created unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have used a sanitary agent in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers around the United States reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed a high-alcoholic sanitary agent, according to the toxicology center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the toxicology center of Georgia, the number of children under 12 years of age who have been reported to poison control centers has increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are getting to these products more often, and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who need to be taken to emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink sanitation intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or as a social media challenge.
Youtube videos show teens drinking sanitizers because of their cheap habit.
Adolescents reportedly mixed a sanitary product with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted to an attractive fragrance.
“Children don’t think it could hurt them,” Lopez said.
Many more attractive (sanitizers) are those that are perfumed.
To deposit are sanitizers with the smell of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges, which are very appealing to children.
The sanitizer contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Particularly in young children, several bows can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"This is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Kansas City Control Toxicology Center at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn’t just let a glass of whiskey go, but people leave these sanitizers out and when they get to them, it’s a quick way to drink alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed up to four slices of a strawberry-scented sanitary agent at school and was taken for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold value considered to be drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who took care of her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered indissoluble words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate pediatric hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell down due to alcohol and stabbed her head, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," said Ortia Scott, Nhaijah's mother, to CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or arrange for sanitation to be within reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some remedies were associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a sanitary product that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Doctors thought that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in northern New York planned to poison their "bad" teachers by deploying antibacterial products across the room, according to police reports.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitizers and banned their presence in the room.
Police deemed the smeared plan an "innocent smuggling," and referred to the school district's discipline,
Fáma: No discrepancies in Celtic
Griffiths minimizes talk of non-compliance in Celtic, while Deila admits that the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he turns it over again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is worried that new reinforcements from January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increase their jump over Celtic by 5 points
The first half penalty in ADAMA Rooney gave Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, giving the Dons a five-point jump between them and the Celtic.
Griffiths denies non-compliance talk
This situation sparked clashes in Celtic, which were denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased oversight in preparation for a match with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don’t think we feel under pressure, I think the player is looking forward to it.
Deficiency in Scottish title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers and former Netherlands defender Ronald de Boer claims that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no longer any rivalry between them for the title.
De Boer, who is currently the Ajax ambassador, says: "The Netherlands no longer show the best of Celtic games, and why?"
'Cause the Rangers aren't there anymore.
The people here don't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the old company.
They talk about the two teams together and that’s what they’re interested in.
There is a lot of tension at the Old Company games and not only the people from Scotland are watching these games.
I'm turning things back to the good, and Deil commits himself.
ROONY Deala admitted that Celtic was a bit bent, but the Norwegian boss pledged to turn things back to good.
The defeat of Malm and the subsequent exit from the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, who had only 10 players and is now standing at the top of the table with a five-point jump.
But Deila says, "Celtic has had a bad time and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of it as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or saddened by current events.
We are exactly the same - but we have to move on.
Really, we really need the support of Celtic because it makes the players much better.
Now it is very important to stay with yourself.
Warburton is worried about January reinforcements
Despite comments that appeared a few weeks ago and indicated that he had already identified some of his January targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is concerned about the big-buying force and insists that he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox team's unity.
Brentford’s former boss said: “The January transition window is very different from the summer window.”
Players arriving in the summer have a full pre-season stay, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes more damage will occur by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic Michu’s transitional target suggests retirement
Attacker Swansea Mich, who was linked to Celtic in a transition window, suggested that he could retire after his contract expires with Swansea.
The 20-year-old shooter has been having problems with his prone ankle for two years and has not been able to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight SFA for comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the wardrobe and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card to this defender was later cancelled - this is the third red card issued by the referee Collum, who was dismissed.
Neilson stands behind his assertion, stating, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths pledges to avoid Tynecastle
The hardcore Hibbe was severely punished after he confessed to singing a song with a lyrics aimed at former player Hearts Rudolph Skácel.
The incident took place in the Roserburn area in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was an endangered moment," the attacker said, "I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless it is in the Celtic suit."
Tannadice Council believes in Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that the Dundee United board still believes in correcting the situation by the current management of the team – but admits that the downfall on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We're going to get the boys ready again," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes is happy for "a ugly victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team desperately had to hold on to the Hamilton Acties in order to win the seventh consecutive league win and a five-point jump in front of the Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a penalty from the first half in the Adam Rooney draw.
McInnes said: “There is no team that has won anything, no matter the cups or leagues, without winning this type of match.”
Scotland's unemployment remains unchanged, while the UK's total unemployment rises
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged to 164,000 in the period between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate was 5.9 per cent above the UK rate (5.5 per cent), according to data from the National Statistics Office (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland decreased by 12,000 over a three-month period, with the number of workers now stagnating to 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent over the quarter – a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell said in a comment on the latest data: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have witnessed further improvements in the labour market, and Scottish employment has increased, while unemployment has declined.
Why I witnessed the execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite the late legal intervention, I will be watching the execution of the man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in the search gallery in the death chamber of Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officers who would witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I'm starting to worry about it.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America and because there are often more applications than vacancies, there is a morbid lottery that decides who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will be watching the entire execution unwittingly.
I can't do that.
I’ll sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends and make a special bond to him through months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that boy.
We often laugh when we talk to each other.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notebook and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'm going to have to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the breeder as he will excuse it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "it could have been formulated better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the Witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help the proceedings against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be on my side.
To find out more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would have made him guilty of committing a crime.
But I believe there's a high probability that he's innocent of the murder.
I firmly believe that there has not been sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is bad.
And from that perspective, I'll be watching his death.
I can't say I'm really objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the man I love die of unnecessary death.
Man escapes from Canning River after police chase
Guard Canning Vale remained dry after evacuating men from Canning River.
A man from Petrhu's bet to run to the police did not come out after he got into the shallow muddy waters just meters from a policeman who tried to forcefully persuade him to return to the shore.
Police from Canning Vale were called in on Tuesday in an incident that crossed to Beckenham.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not going out, just come for me,'" Shandell Castledine said.
Guard Lachlan Perhavec just didn’t want to dip his uniform, so he tried to use safer tactics and police negotiations.”
"People sometimes try to do funny things when they run away," Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove a car into the trench to avoid a bus and try to cross the Swan River.
His efforts were futile, but he inspired the locals to start planning the Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody says the organizers have tried to spy on him and threatens to end the races
Peeter Moody accused Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stadium last year and threatened to stop the race immediately.
He focused on the organizers and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, and was convinced that they had a personal campaign against him with the late scraping of Lady Tatai during the day of the race, which was the last drop for him on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media had always tried to do what was best for the race and was in a difficult situation when it came to Lidarin’s positive cobalt coating that he couldn’t explain.
He whispered about the 18-month spying charge and did not want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't mean to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you're just feeling so frustrated that it all comes out of you at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and I'm going to get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk with my head up and let the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start thinking otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'd do with my license.
Moody previously released a bomb in an interview for racing.com that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him a job in my stalls for finding information about the things that are being done in my stalls," Moo said.
Of course they thought I was a scammer.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information, because in an attempt to catch me completely burned.
Robert Roulston, former President of RVL, David Moodie, current President of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still aware of it today.
Should I think it's going to be a personal matter?
Will the RVL raise a few balls and make sure people outside the coaching position take responsibility for what’s going on in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think they do.
Maybe they need me to take my license and get me out of here and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them the material to think about.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will push them and put a burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The trainer’s frustration levels increased with long-term investigations into cobalt including Lidari and recent cracks in it aroused the feeling that he “might have hours of his license on the table.”
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, labeled the treatment rule on the race day as "funny" after the horse was applied to the legs with a clay covering or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
Somebody on my team accidentally put dirt on his leg.
He could've had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it could have happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for the treatment of hernias on the day of the race, for which the organizers had already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don’t know anything about horses.
“We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
The Cobra driver who caught was arrested.
Police arrested a man who crashed a bike in Cobra on the weekend and left after the collision.
The cyclist was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley Main Road on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping and helping the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia himself confessed to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be accused of not stopping in an accident, not providing assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, remains in the hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Returns to Rivals for Wrestling Claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy criticized his players' actions as "making a plan" for two NRL Premiership fans.
Trent Robinson, Sydney Roosters coach, said the referees allowed Storm players to "wrestle" its players during the Storm team's controversial victory in the qualification final in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly blurred remark on the Strorm after his team won the qualifying final over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "review" of the rugby league and according to him, two of the Queensland Grands.
Bellamy defended the actions of his players and said that during them they focused on "contact."
Bellamy added that this situation increased his self-confidence as his team is being criticized by two coaches, which may mean they are afraid of defeating Storm.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were beaten 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven’t changed anything from our defensive system and technology over the past year, the last few weeks we’ve only focused on contact during the procedures, and that was a turning point for us.
Trent has been here for three years and obviously is training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how things like that always come in this part of the year.
Bellamy devalued Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St. George-Illawarra Dragons team won the 2010 Premiership by playing "dull" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was just as exciting as ours, and it was just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticized for being boring on the team and Wayne said he didn’t care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of the game, which he finds disruptive, especially his young backers with their speed.
You would like to play this kind of football if you had this type of player available.
This opinion was expressed in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two backers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It excites me more self-confidence because they say things like that because they're afraid of the game against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t even think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that more goals fell in the Storm and Roosters match than in the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I didn't look, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and non-scoring experiments interesting?
I think it's agendas.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet again at some stage.
Storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man gets <0x24>200,000 bail on drug charges
A man who faced a possible lifelong detention of 40 kilograms of cocaine, who was smuggled from Queensland, received a <0x24>200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police looking for 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht, which came from South America via Vanuatu and anchored in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted during a meeting with the accused in the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in the Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possession of cocaine of commercial quality, lawyer Maksimovice built a defense on the fact that there is no evidence that he would own the whole quantity and that he could be completely accidental and innocent in the cafe.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan believed that Maximovic had fled.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he said on Wednesday.
In the coronavirus case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovice’s mother and father-in-law jointly offered a <0x24>200,000 bail for his release.
“After reading the sworn statements of both parties, it is clear that the <0x24>200,000 bail is a real financial burden for them,” Judge Flanagan said.
Their own efforts were apparently insufficient, as the defendant did not go to court, he warned.
Maksimov was given a bail on condition that he would give up both Australian and Serbian passports, will report to the police daily and will comply with the ban of departure from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to get pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then logged into her online chat, where he had a lot of inappropriate photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found out she was missing her phone and then found it in Hogg’s sleeping hand.
She passed him, and before she alerted her mother, she found disturbing news.
The police got involved and saw five photos, then the analytics computers found the address and found a "concerning" search on the web using terms to search for immoral images of children.
Hogg then claimed to police that his reason was to “bring pedophiles” online before he “pretended to be a police officer and intimidated them.”
Eilidh Robertson, a tax attorney, told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it's addiction - that he's addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he was doing a computer search, but claims he was just pretending to be a policeman to intimidate the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted to send another one.
According to him, he did it to attract them.
He claims he jumped in drunkenness and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, shaking and crying.
She saw immoral pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and talked about how the defendant used her computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, based in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to taking or providing inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, violated bail terms on 25 January and did not appear in court on 24 March of this year.
Attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed on the list of sexual offences because he could argue that there was "no essential sexual subtext" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the October verdict for reporting to social workers.
Hogg was given a bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing about other unresolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sexual offenders before the date of his verdict.
Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe has made a bad speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs leading to the stage earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall became viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also stained by claims by opposition lawmakers that they had received anonymous death threats that warned them of Mr Mugabe's detachment during his speech.
Last month, he was drafted and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gones, chairman of the Democratic Change Movement (MDC), said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to stop Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that will not appear, but is called 'death'," Mugabe told reporters after his speech.
It warns the Members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and once they step out of parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai had "concerns" about threats to members.
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce the number of jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard will eliminate 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost saving efforts.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the PC and printer business from its fastest-growing enterprise hardware and services operations.
The expected reduction in the number of jobs will result in a change of around <0x24>2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring activities will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP’s CEO and chairman of the board, who will lead the unit after the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of businesses that will help businesses transition to a new business style,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than <0x24>50 billion and will be "focused on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will result in the dissolution of the company, founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who produce electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage was nicknamed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to manage the shift from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest tech companies in America, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that the firm is closely specialized with better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says co-players must get injured by Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed for Wilshere that it is still only September and if his rehabilitation goes as planned, there is no reason not to play Christmas again.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least four more English games and, historically speaking, his involvement in the next European Summer Championship is obviously uncertain.
The big damage to this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after ankle injury and then returned to former form during the pre-season.
“This type of injury does not endanger a career,” Wenger says.
It is a wound that requires healing.
It's not anything special.
It was just an accident.
It was not about his ankles or any injuries he had suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
There is also an unpleasant formula.
The survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries to Wilshere since he made his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he has only played in 65 Arsenal league games out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in the sixth of eight seasons since 2007-08, he was one of the two Premier League clubs that lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the wizarding circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of injuries recorded during the last season will continue.
“Sometimes when you come back after an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win the competition,” Wenger says.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he does, and he'll have the career he deserves.
Arsenal starts campaigning in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb in a game with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to perform.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal's Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and let the players who need it breathe out,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
The dynamo were also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after last season's "invincible" campaign.
The stadium was shaken by a 3.2-degree Richter earthquake on Wednesday night.
This year, it was already established in Zagreb.
Wenger thinks Arsenal learned from last season’s Champions League capitulation against Monaco, and he remains a distant hope of leading the club to a first European Cup victory.
"This deployment is huge," Wenger says.
This has never happened to Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar displays in various shows is eye-catching, especially due to the need for men to open up more desperate than ever when it comes to suicide among young men under the age of 15.
In 2013, it was the only leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 years in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to solve this problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) marked 2015 as the Year of the Man, whose aim is to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help if needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with symptoms of depression found that if the injured had a sufficiently high percentage of "healthy" friends, their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends represents half the chance of having mental problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must be reachable first.
In this communication via social media with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the communication, immediate response is often preferred over meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful has doubled, even though in reality we are more isolated.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of our real values – our personal desire for growth and friendship – which have a profound impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game creator recently explained, money doesn’t really buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, which radiated through friendly interaction.
Joey’s humor and Chandler’s frequent victims, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross’ desire for Rachel, all stemming from the knowledge that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they mostly keep their feelings for themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: “My role as a listener for people who feel depressed or suicidal has really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference.”
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old saying "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends are one of the shows that will come to my mind when I try to offer a longer-term balancing mechanism.
Emphasizes small moments in male friendship.
As for my task, the outsider status on the phone helps people in times of despair, but long-term support must come from a closer, network of friends and family.
So if you’re going to the FriendsFest this weekend organized by Comedy Central station, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely reworked for the occasion of the celebration.
Or if you see someone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello to him.
You never know what difference your friendship can make.
The Friends series will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - for <0x23>FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG defeat Malmo
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavanim after firing a goal against Malm.
Angel Di Maria scored on his debut in the Champions League, helping PSG defeat Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's a report of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with a final comfort 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot the goal less than four minutes after his debut in the Champions League and this PSG player sent French champions after winning, but then missed a few chances until they finally increased their jump when Cavani shot the goal in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for the elimination rounds, but on improving their way to the quarter-finals, which they recorded in each of the previous 3 seasons.
But even if they scored three points, it was not the classic performance of Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was lost in front of the goal and was later replaced against his home team and club, where he began his famous career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win outside or at home in the Champions League, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents a problem and looking comfortable in the defensive is a good start, even though there are things we'll have to improve over the course of the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we didn’t shoot one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after being injured as one of the three changes to PSG, which held at home this weekend a 2-2 draw with Bordeaux in Ligue 1, but was shadowed in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing was marked as the man who moved PSG in Europe to a new level after moving from Manchester United last month, and showed why when he ran for Marc Verratti's passport to defend Malm and with a beautiful finish he sent the ball behind Johan Wilanda's back to the corner.
However, if someone expected it to start a great PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated the Celtic in the play-off and entered this stage, joined with 9 internationals in the base and five defenders and two backers were a heavy opponent.
But apart from the shot by Nikola Djurdjice, who just passed the remote corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, PSG themselves took advantage of the attack with bad shots and a miserable ending, which was not good either from Ibrahimovice, who was unable to shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot hit the net shortly after the second half.
However, he proved to be much more appropriate when he came to prepare opportunities for his fellow players and it was just from his recording when Di Maria sent a torque shot that ended up in Wilando's fire in 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayese sent the sixth goal in a row after Ibrahimovic gave him a left-wing grab from Maxwell.
This put an end to all Malm's thoughts about the possibility that they could make a profit from the match, and only the excellent intervention of Wilanda from great proximity shattered David Luise's hopes and the score remained unchanged even when the goal had not been scored by the substitute.
Team coach Malmo Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were class-higher than his team, Nor said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Downstairs for Paris.
It was a great match for them.
Glencore earns <0x24>2.5 billion for stock sales
The Swiss-based Glencore mining giant, which was hit by a collapse in commodity prices, earned <0x24>2.5 billion on Wednesday from the sale of shares as part of its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
This company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is facing commodity price slump as the Chinese economy slows down demand and sparks certain losses across markets.
The issue of rights sent Glencore's stock price to the top of the London stock market in early morning stores on Wednesday.
Stocks jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened up 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that the sale of <0x24>2.5 billion shares is part of broader plans to reduce their <0x24>30 billion debt, which accumulated about a third.
The company sold new shares at a price of 123 pence per share, a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
It eliminated 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 per cent for the group.
Concerns about the prolongation of Chinese growth slowed the price of iron ore by almost half, and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20 to 40 percent.
White House Confirms Washington Visits Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House said in its report on Tuesday.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing, which he welcomed in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his colleague Peng Liyuan to the state dinner to be held after the talks have ended.
“President Xi’s visit is an opportunity to strengthen U.S.-China relations, and calls for cooperation in solving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests, and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the disagreements between the two states.”
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit Seattle, where he will meet several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington, and then go on to New York for a UN meeting in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address controversy, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and its increasing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis swept away the Schengen area.
The emergency lights fired by Germany have not far removed the European crew, but are already forcing the ship to change course, wrote the French daily Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the refugee problem: it will be more systematically categorizing migrants and asylum seekers as soon as it enters the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than fighting for the real-life distribution of refugees.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the Member States changed their priorities.
Before taking care of the final destination of the runners, first of all, it is necessary to filter those who are arriving today and solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is necessary to manage migration," the minister said in a text discussed Monday in Brussels.
After the crisis of the single currency, the EU finds itself in jeopardy in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its determination and increases the pressure.
It restores border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of those seeking asylum in the country.
The central power thus makes it clear that without it, no free movement in Europe is possible.
The fact that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday has already served as evidence.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, though with varying intensity.
Hungary has been doing this for a long time.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under the Schengen rules.
It is a dominant effect, but it can also be seen by the blind.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of compulsory entry controls in Greece, in southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already crossed into the country.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed the issue intensively during a private interview with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is realised.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of newly arrived runners have already been registered and identified with a fingerprint crossing.
Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point on its territory because it fears more than others that there will be camps on its lungs where refugees will accumulate at its expense.
Greece remains the real black hole in the world.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, which is twice as much as they have recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge ringing hole.
Athens, who are still in financial turmoil and awaiting a new government, put their hands on the kiln.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and a source of common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises that checkpoints will be introduced as soon as possible, but it has not given any number or date.
"The challenges Greece faces are all over Europe," EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on the front.
It is therefore a matter of deploying intervention teams of the European Border Control Agency Frontex in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum and strengthen the surveillance of the islands.
"There will be a need for adequate financial resources," warns the text submitted to the ministers for approval.
From the point of view of law, Athens will continue to have the last word.
The question of the creation of genuine European border guards has not been formally raised, but Europe is approaching it.
The new emergency situation in the 1980s has put the question of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees to the second row, set up by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament earlier this year and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, not the duty, was retained on Monday in a text approved by a majority of the eighties.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm pledge includes the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which was already agreed during the EU’s hectic summit in June, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead under a lava in the Alps, of which allegedly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists who killed a lava in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, the German nationality is also the woman who survived as the only one of the affected eight-member group.
Previous media reports said it was Polka's case.
A 30-year-old woman was hospitalized in Briancon with a severe leg injury in the sternum area.
According to AFP, the dead were mostly 40 people.
"The rescue is over, the bodies of the victims have also been transferred to Briancon to be identified," said Pierre Besnard, prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
The accident occurred around noon in the Pelvoux mountain range below the peak of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins, measuring 4015 meters.
"The low avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
According to him, a huge amount of snow fell on the eight-member group at an altitude of about 3,900 meters.
The Meteorological Service did not warn the area today of bad weather.
Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> before the match against Braga: finally Europe.
Coach Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> was able to pass through the front line of the European League with Liberce in his first cup and now he is looking forward to enjoying the right Europe with the team.
Slovan welcomes the finalist from 2011 Brag at the opening stage of the competition and according to the coach, she wants to enforce her style of play.
After all the nerves in the elimination fights, when every goal and every situation could have eliminated you on the way to the dream group, now we're there and we're going to play six games.
Of course, we want to win, but we don’t have to be afraid of every score, we can play our tactics, and we’re not tied to just a double.
"I look forward to this and it's a real Europe, before it was just a qualification," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said at a press conference.
Braga is the top team.
He will be very active, having the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may be even more difficult if he doesn’t have that name, but he has a player in his squad who gave three goals to Manchester.
"This is an excellent overall at the top level of the teams," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
He doesn’t think of Braga as a clear favorite.
We play at home, so we're not outsiders.
"I think we have shown in both home competition and preschool that we are strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team only lost in this season's eleven duels in the opening Super Cup in Pilsen.
He believes that the Liberec can also enforce his style.
We are waiting for a team that will be strong on the ball, but at the same time it is untypically disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 setup with a quick transition to the attacking phase.
"It's a very difficult opponent, although we have found the weak, but the most important thing is how our players will do it on the pitch," Trpi<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
We studied a lot of opponents in preschools, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapted the training.
"And we definitely want, even if it will be very challenging, to play according to our notes," added the coach.
Student films will be controlled by Sand, the international festival begins.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries this year submitted their works to the competition for the 15th anniversary of the International Student Film Festival in Pisa.
Four dozen of them, sent to the finals by a committee of students and educators, will be held from 15 to 18 October in the Porty<0xC4><0x8D> cinema.
The best of them will be selected by the international jury, said Jakub Charvát, a spokesman for the festival.
Each year the festival has its own special theme, which differs from the sound of the festival.
This year she's a detective.
Richard Blumenfeld, the director of this year’s festivities, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatrical productions.
"And of course we also have to solve the crime that was committed in our race this year," Charvát said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of the student creation - movies played, animated and documentary.
They will be assessed by an international jury, which will include, for example, last year’s winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Shard.
The organizers of the festival, as every year, prepare an accompanying program.
The Wattican Punk Ballet comes from Armenia, singer Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Smeykal, turbosanson band Pol<0xC4><0x99>time?, playing the band Zrni or for example Petra Hapková with the recital Life at the bar.
The festival will also host two photo exhibitions.
The graduate of the lyrics school and the holder of prestigious awards, Jana Ashenbrenner from World Press Photo 2014, will be the first to bring in.
The second exhibition draws closer to the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The film The Cameraman will be accompanied by Gerhard Gruber with his music and the sand family Brukner, Novotn<0xC3><0xBD> and Hlach in the studio of the sculptor Jan Novotn<0xC3><0xBD> will baptize his new book 3 friends from the city.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC4><0x8D>ka, the patron of FAMO in Pískov, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are a reference to him who will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop joint ties and film crafts," the spokesman said.
This will certainly help the Pitching Forum, where students can meet with film professionals, complete several job inspections at once and thus gain a job position.
The festival is associated with the establishment of the Private Higher Professional Film School in Py<0xC5><0x84>sk.
Its founders, Vladana and Milo<0xC5><0x88> Ter<0xC4><0x8D>ovi, organized the first annual event in 1997.
By the sixth year, it was held once every two years.
In case of CK bankruptcy, the insurance companies must pay the claims of the clients in full.
Insurers should pay the claims of clients in the event of a full bankruptcy of the travel agency.
It was decided on Wednesday by the House of Commons when it approved a revised draft of the Law on the Conditions of Business in Tourism.
Travel offices will be able to, according to the proposal for consideration to the Senate, replace the bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee.
The insurer with the obligation to pay the claims of the clients does not agree even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Local Development is undergoing adjustment, arguing for consumer protection.
Insurers have already threatened to stop insurance for travel agencies against a crash once the novelty is in force.
The proposal is also criticized by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will either have to end up or go abroad.
Minister of Local Development Karla <0xC5><0xA0>elchtová (for ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full reimbursements are not Euro-compliant.
She pointed to this year’s decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the correct limit, <0xC5><0xA0>echtová stressed.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit that it is feasible," said TOP 09 Vice President Miroslav Kalousek.
Bank guarantees will not work, because no one gives it unlimited.
“The city offices will have to stop their activities or move to abroad,” Kalousek warned.
A member of the Presidency of the Association of Czech Travel Offices and the agency Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with the Kalu<0xC5><0xA1>ka concerns on the basis of a survey between the members of the CK.
"Stop showing us the lobbying of the insurance company," he said.
The statements of the insurers do not consider Okamura to be relevant, and there is no official written statement of the insurers in this regard.
However, they are trying to figure out whether the travel agencies will form a joint venture, which according to Okamura is not a problem.
Jana Fischer (ODS) also warned of the provision, which referred to the competitive opinion of the Association of Czech travel agencies, and her side colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about the lubrication of the stairs to the Czech travel agencies.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
“Consumer protection works,” says Fischer.
Her proposal to release the disputed passport was not approved by the House.
He did not even move Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Filip (KS<0xC4><0x8C>M) with a proposal to return the proposal to the committee due to an alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Filip pointed out that travel agencies are likely to be a threat to consumers.
The rapporteur for the proposal, Martin Berdych (ANO), has withdrawn her proposal in view of the Constitutional Court's ruling, which would limit the liability of the insurers in cases where they could not know that the insurance coverage does not cover the entire risk.
The novel will not originally propose a minimum four million-dollar insurance limit for travel agencies offering travel by air, and a million-dollar limit for offices selling bus trips, for example.
The border will remain at 30 percent of the planned revenues from travel sales.
However, the limit of insurance coverage will have to be such that in the event of a bankruptcy of the travel agency covers all claims of the customers.
Even after the adjustments, the norm states that travel agencies will have to re-indique which travel agency organizes the trip for the sold trips.
Travel agencies will have to submit to the insurance companies prior to the conclusion of the contract, including information on the management and number of trips.
The approved amendment of the Committee on Public Administration shall also include further regular information to the insurers.
Travel agencies will have to provide them with monthly data on the number of passengers and the trips sold, the total price of the trips sold, and the amount of advances and sales for the trips and for references to them.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has not fulfilled any of the legal obligations to the insurance company, it will call on it according to the proposal for amendment or will be able to prohibit it from entering into new contracts if the breach of the obligation could jeopardize the interests.
The novella is also intended to revise the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the mountain service grant on the basis of its request, which will always be submitted by the end of April for the next year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money in the previous year, a financial plan for expenditure and a outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, the lawmakers did not think about what would happen if the insurance company canceled the CK contract.
It will not be allowed to arrange tours and customers who purchased the tour before cancellation of insurance will lose it according to the association.
CK in such a case will suffer a significant loss and may even collapse, although its management was in good condition.
One of the ways in which travel agencies can cope with such a situation will be to appeal to the state for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad and then in our market we will only act as agencies, said the vice president of the association Jan Pape<0xC5><0xBE>.
Although the proposal for the novel also contains the Institute of Bank Guarantee, it is so unthinkable that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, since the Bank Guarantee cannot sound like an unlimited amount.
Moreover, according to the association, the change in the practice so far is de facto unnecessary.
Within two years, due to the new EU directive, it will be necessary to revise the entire law.
The Czech market now operates a total of 942 active insured travel agencies.
This year, only three CKs have ended their operations.
Domestic travel agencies sell tours worth about CZK 20 billion per year.
Merkel: We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must take action to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced this after talks with German Prime Ministers.
At the same time, it reiterated its call for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU between the eighties.
We need to help more countries where refugees are leaving, or where they are staying after they leave their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will be working on decent conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and in Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, who said that such a signal could also be higher financial assistance or closer cooperation between the EU and international humanitarian organisations.
"Gender countries are also supporting the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the burden of the refugee crisis to European countries," Merkel said.
In this context, Branniborsk Prime Minister Dietmar Woidke said at a press conference that he expects genuine solidarity from all EU countries.
The distribution of runners in the EU on the basis of quotas has long rejected, among other things, the Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke also expressed their support for accelerating asylum procedures in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to begin with the integration of foreigners faster, the Defence Prime Minister said.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money Germany spends on the care of ordinary people serves precisely to integrate those who have the chance to obtain asylum.
It will take more teachers to be able to speak German to the refugees.
“It’s a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if ordinary people are able to integrate, they can be of benefit to us,” he said.
Matt Damon is diminishing the diversity of the film.
Matt Damon confronted Afro-Aramean filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity with the claim that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During HBO's Sunday episode of the Greenlight project, the actor occupying the Brown series was interrupted when it stressed the need for alternative views of the Black protagonists in the script.
“When we talk about diversity, you’re doing it by capturing a movie and not by capturing a show,” Damon says.
Shocked, Brown reacted horribly with distrust and whispered, "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when comments about Martian got on the air.
Damon and Brown have joined well-known producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
“I would like to appeal to people to think, no matter who the director is, how they will behave to Harmony’s character,” Brown said at the outset.
The only black character that's a whore that's packed by a white slut.
Producer Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio advocated for the rights to direct the film; Damon said that their director could "finally give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, social media exploded in disagreement with Damon’s comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at writing the clip, "Matt Damon jumped into speaking the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SO WHITE that it hurts."
The tweet has received more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 characters since it was released.
Damon’s comment comes at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teen Michael Brown was killed by white police in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national influence and pressured lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colorful people.
In February, the singer Prince made hints to the movement, while nominated for the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"Albums are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
Recently, the leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in response to the Fox News personality question, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the directors said.
Damon was recently listed on the list of entertainers, producers and media monks who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the view of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the Pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
Professional mountaineer and mountaineer Isaac Caldiero became the first competitor to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and take home <0x24>1 million.
In the competition that just ended its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the final of this season, two men broke into the last round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second slope after a more than 220 m long rope.
Britten was the first to complete the splash within a set limit, making him the first competitor to beat the American Ninja Warrior in a 4-stroke, but Caldiero beat it in three seconds and won the race.
Caldiero gave an interview to E! News immediately after his hard-hitting victory and it was to know that he was still shocked by winning a <0x24>1 million major prize.
“It’s an amazing feeling, I’ve never made more than <0x24>10,000 a year in my life,” Isaac E! said in response to his winnings.
“So all of a sudden... I can’t even imagine what it’s going to be like now.”
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview with The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the final and why Britten won't get any rewards despite becoming the first competitor to complete the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the person who completes the route the fastest.
“If more than one competitor participates in the race, the winner will be the one with the best time,” Weed said.
Although winning the main win would change his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
“I don’t think he’d have a clue.
He's glad he's got what he's got.
He received a warm welcome from his fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.”
Geoff told me, “If there should be someone who could have beaten me, I’m glad it was Isaac.”
And I think if I win, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue its eighth season, which will begin shooting in spring 2016.
Tigers from Detroit just crossed the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit tigers, the second half of the season was not just a walk through the rose garden.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, are currently in the last place of the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers have only just stopped their defeat by defeating Minessota 5-4 at Target Field in Tuesday's match.
The twins missed a chance to get closer to the Houston Astros and capture the second wild card in the American League.
Although for only one night, for Detroit it was the return of the words to Z, which was so inconceivable for them during the second half of the season.
“Winning is always fun and it doesn’t matter how,” Tiger manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tiger Sponsor Alfredo Simon retained his offensive lead, and Detroit scored three times in the first two shifts and then took another in the sixth and ninth shifts.
Simon (13-9) allowed opponents 6 1/3 fires and 3 rounds.
It was his third game of the last nine matches.
“I want to end this year with convincing results,” Simon said.
“It’s hard to get into a game when you’re often sitting on a bench and that’s why I want to get into the game.”
Tiger striker Victor Martinez hit three times and made 2 rounds and his first draw point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point match since the last game in June, in which he hit the Seattle Mariners four times.
"He's done well," Ausmus said.
"He looked good at the training, he fired significantly better and he managed to move it to the game."
Thanks to three rounds at the end of the seventh shift, the Twins had the greatest chance of returning to the game.
Byron Buxton's central pole won the turn thanks to two points on the left side of the playground.
Right pole Aaron Hicks scored thanks to his set foot, and Simon shook Brian Dozier before Blaine Hardy replaced him.
Hardy knocked out his only rival, Mauer, and faced Miguel San, a fighter who fired the ball and ran two shots and left behind right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two players on the balls and chances of rebound in the second round, VerHagen managed to send the third goalkeeper over two goals.
Plouffe has already won 27 runs over two innings this season and reigns the league table.
Detroit retained the ninth shift, Mauer scored two relegated points, and Bruce Rondon secured a 5-4 score for the Tigers.
However, this right-hander eliminated Sana on three counts.
Detroit took advantage of the advantages and scored points in the game of Phil Hughes.
The Tigers won three rounds in the first two shifts against a sergeant who entered the game after more than a month's break due to inflammation of the back muscles.
"I certainly didn't imagine such a start," said Hughes, "but during the third shift I already felt that I was better off."
After resisting the pressure in the first turn, Hughes left one point to the second goalkeeper Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the right pole J.D. Martineze brought out Victor Martineze, who was the first to run all the matches.
Victor Martinez interrupted his 0-21 series.
Third goalkeeper Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the pitch and scored the next round, but Victor Martinez was overtaken when he tried to reach the third goal.
The Tigers added in the second shift, when the scorer James McCann and polar Anthony Gose scored two and scored one point, and the result scored 3-0 on the table.
“It got us to our knees,” said Twin Manager Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit the ball too well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won by the number of overshoots, finished in the third round without points and was replaced by A.J. Achter.
Hughes scored three runs, won six shots and four strikes.
Note: Anibal Sanchez, the right Tiger defender, ended the match with pain in the right shoulder.
He is taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August due to the tense muscles in his shoulder, is expected to play in Wednesday's match.
Sanchez is replaced by leftist Daniel Norris, who returns after the injury and takes action against the Twins.
From June 30, when Norris was replaced by left-back David Price, he scored 1-1 after 4 games.
However, he hasn’t won since August 20 because of his tense muscle.
Tigers and Twins will play their third match at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will face Minnesota left-back Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group, whose task is Tuesday's governance reform.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and enhancing open policies," he said about the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group to deepen the overall reform.
The promotion of openness in parental reforms will add new impetus and vitality, will also provide a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The management group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, liberalisation of border control policies, support for state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and reorganization of the registry resident system.
The declaration states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises that are beyond investment limits.
This system will be progressively tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is significant because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies, and ensure that the companies themselves will decide how to manage their business.
The statement also said that China would allow border regions to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open up a state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are financed from abroad and will provide better services to them," the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card", thanks to the optimization of requirements and simplifying the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and public prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and chairpersons Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
In the Karlovy Vary region, a new bed department may be created.
According to Jakub Pánika (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), the current capacity of the bed departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
However, there is also the possibility of extension of care in the region.
For example, in the surgical department departments, one-day surgical centers could be created where, according to the concept, surgical departments that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be performed.
In which specific hospitals should the workplace focused on one-day surgery be, it is not yet clear.
In the skin department of Karlovy Vary Hospital, a laser center with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases could be created again.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apalical center that would take care of patients with brain impairment who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the hospital of Ostrov, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity, which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary region, is the bed of follow-up care, and in particular the bed of long-term patients treated (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdka is insufficient and should, above all, be closely attached to the acute.
Part of this device should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, suggests the concept.
As he notes, the bed of follow-up care is missing mainly in the hospital Karlovy Vary.
It would be possible to use abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least, in the Karlovy Vary region, there is no social health bed with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
These beds are a deficiency throughout the republic, so it could also serve other regions as the so-called Alzheimer’s Center.
Hospitals should also be prepared, as recommended, for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, on which funds from European grants will be released.
"These are beds that will follow up on subspecialized care and will provide room for patients to be transplanted after surgery, for example, after a cardiosurgical, neurosurgical, transplantation or other procedure," describes the Circular Bed Care Concept.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
