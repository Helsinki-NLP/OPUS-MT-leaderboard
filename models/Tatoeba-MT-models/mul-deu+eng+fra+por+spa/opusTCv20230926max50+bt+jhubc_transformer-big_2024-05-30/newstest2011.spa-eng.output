The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry shop
The new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD councillors in the capital will seem to have to overcome the obvious language barriers for the members of the Prague Council and the Municipal Council to understand their renewed ODS colleagues.
The period Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz "examined" the members of the new Council of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD to check their knowledge of the slang-marked language that has emerged in the Council in recent years, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The codified dictionary that used Prague's political flower and birthplace during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been proven that the new councillors hardly understand those well-known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
“Who is Voldemort?”
"The truth is I don't know."
"I'm rather a novice in Prague politics," said Culture Councillor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> during the "college" terminology exam.
And with regard to the political veteran, Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted the same way.
Maybe you know the concept of "golf hoop".
"Maybe it's the only expression of all you've asked me that I use from time to time."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Of the glossary, whose definitions were published by the newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz last June before the ODS voting congress, the redaction selected six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "Prague's biggest golf hole", "going to the pastry shop", "tow nut", "capital betrayal" and "blind".
Three councillors agreed to undergo the test and a fourth, Antonin Weinert, who in future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councilor, Petr Dolínek, directly refused to do so.
“I don’t put myself in these things or think about how the civic Democrats enjoy themselves.”
“What really matters to me is how we will understand ourselves in the execution of our programs,” he said.
As has been seen, Mayor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly did not realize that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of the former Mayor of Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
To Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> the word "Voldemort" tells him nothing; the only term he succeeded in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, who immediately adds: "But I know it for the news."
"I'm going to have to point to a language course," he jokes.
Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf course, but also the Environmental Councillor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
Afterwards, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort and Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> really are and even know where to find that character; in addition, he suspects the meaning of "going to the pastry."
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; soon it is revealed to Plach<0xC3><0xBD> that it is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's companies.
Like B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, it indicates that such knowledge obtained them from the news, but that it does not use such a vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among the socio-democrats.
“I asked my colleagues, but it really looks like we don’t have anything like that.”
“Instead, we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations, or we make word games with names,” says Prague’s <0xC4><0x8C>SSD president Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD>, whose party comrades call Hulda.
“I was called B<0xC5><0x99>íza in college, but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that as well,” confesses his nickname Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
The newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz tested the name and works.
For his partymates, Weinert is D<0xC4><0x9B>da (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they were associated before the election fraud during the party's sponsorship, is nicknamed "Igrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek" ("playmobile") by some of his compa.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that social democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz even discovered other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The Doctor of the Laws of Pigs" seems to recall that Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> obtained his doctorate in Law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of “witches,” he published in a brochure
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They usually have an advanced age, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "turn" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men seldom suffer such a thing."
“Young healthy women are also not isolated, because they help at work and have children,” explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state Burkina Faso, is in a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual “social measure”.
He issued an information booklet that should help avoid witch hunting.
However, this has a sticker.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso don’t know how to read,” warns Die Standard about the disadvantages of written awareness.
The accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate aggregate of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman clinged to the oil used for ritual ointments.
He was caught in flames when the group wanted to “expulse the evil spirits” from the woman.
The isolation of “witches” is supported by people of all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old Burkina Faso businessman as saying: "The devourers of human souls have always represented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to calm the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
“Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt’s death, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt that allegedly had been related to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself through black magic.”
“To help him, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president’s personal escort, were forced to bring randomly chosen men and women from among the Gambian peoples to the president’s property in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
At the estate, the people arrested had to drink a pomegranate of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which, in addition, caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the detainees did not survive the stay on the farm.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand people detained.
The tenant of Bakala: heated with coal stoves and signed a higher rent
The man, aged and reluctant, crossed the doors of the customer service center of RPG Byty company of the "coal magnet" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>ek Bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he was carrying documents with the new three-story lease agreements: his, his daughter and his son, who is fulfilling the sentence.
The three of them have just been stalled by the liberalization of rentals.
Instead of 3,500 Czech kroner per month, the child will pay 4,100 kroner from next year for a two-room flat with a separate second-class kitchen.
“In addition, there is no hot water available and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler,” the man shows with his finger in his son’s new contract, over whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," he explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which categorized the new conditions of rental as "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants do not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing how to proceed in these cases.
But, before this, man only makes an ademan.
"Everyone says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a major testing laboratory for liberalization.
After the New Year it will happen with the vast majority of apartments that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rental.
That is why Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of the four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a number pickup machine.
"Lease 2011", you can read on a bright button of your touch screen.
By pressing it, a card with a number comes out of the machine.
Almost no time to even read "157" and already the number appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the queue.
Shortly thereafter, an advanced marriage arrives to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: requests for settlements, insurance issues, and similar issues.
The charters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava at the tenants’ mailboxes of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes an increase in rent of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window opens at the customer service center for new rentals.
“It’s been working for a week, so it’s getting started,” they say, after briefly doubting the workers who are in it when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
The liberalization and the old floors for miners in Bakala are the most delicate topics in the area.
Before the elections, they were already dealt with loudly and clearly by the Vice-President of Parliament from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, and now appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
“Twenty years later, I want a new floor.”
"I didn't even change my goddamn bathroom dish," the man mentioned in the introduction was disappointed.
According to the workers, at the moment more than anything retirees come to check if they receive a discount on the rental if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15 will also receive half of the discount on the February rental.
However, the window of mining "liberalization" will undoubtedly fail to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
“Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only about forty or fifty people asked about the rent in 2011,” the window employee estimates.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If both parties fail to reach a lease agreement, an independent judge will have to settle the matter.
"It's not a threat, it's information about the only way to proceed as possible and completely in accordance with the law," RPG warns on its pages.
“Here no one is going to be judged,” says one of RPG Byty’s employees and a man who is on the street in front of the customer service center gives, at least in part, the reason.
“I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means of going to court,” he says.
But immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people wait," he says.
Lease regulation will cease to exist in the majority of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"Current rentals still do not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, who adds that the careless state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for the main tenants, increasing the renter's income.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest four billion in apartment rentals, in the four years going from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the waiting room seats, now repeats some data that stand out in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
“In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per square meter per month,” the screen says.
Only 38% increase in the 400-story rental of the RPG portfolio.
“In such cases, this is an increase from an extremely low amount of 19.66 crowns per square meter,” RPG says.
On 2,600 floors, the rental will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not impact rents from scratch, but will scale between four to eight years.
In addition, add the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rise of the rent (see chart) again on the floors, mainly in saving on heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those signing the rental agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need nursery
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that he also hides in his interior a small kindergarten with everything he owns to such facilities: colored walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees have been able to attend.
Architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose studio came out numerous well-known buildings in Brno, thought from the first drafts of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-guardianship.
The company employs around 90 people, mainly at the age of the baby boom, and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after motherhood.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, nursery is one of the benefits Arch.Design offers to its employees as part of its social program.
Builders and architects in this way have the opportunity to combine a demanding profession with the care of children.
The minigarden was an idea of the Arch.Designu employees themselves and, with the support of the management, managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s minigarden is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment, as well as the Czech Republic’s state budget.
Thanks to the funding granted (a grant of more than 2.8 million Czech kroner) they were able to buy the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When funding runs out (two years), Arch.Design is obliged to keep the mini-gardenhouse running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project took one year and the company contributed to the submission of the funding application.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified staff; in addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care. The kindergarten currently accommodates children without age limits, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since it is a "mini-carriage", it can only accommodate up to five children simultaneously, although with turns they come more during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible to adapt to the needs of the parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the kindergarten, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the contents of the mini-guardianship program are comparable to the usual preschool education program.
In it, children not only play, but they also receive a quality teaching: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach English.
The class not only has toys and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself create a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up late school children when they are away from their workplace.
Parents are more productive while they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a loyalty relationship between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is placed among firms that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened staff marketing.
The house of the bones continues to fascinate after 100 years.
The roof looks like the lobe of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur, and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to its skeleton-like shape, the locals nicknamed it "the house of the bones".
Its organic shapes, its striking colors, the novel use of the stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of the scales and the smoothly curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The porch of the house plays with oniric lines, delicate colors and textures derived from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought order is observed.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, as it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
The serpent and the twisting of shapes still surprises us inside as well.
The corrugated wood copies the frames of the windows, curtains, door ornaments, mirrors and posters.
The Casa Batlló, located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gràcia, emerged from the remodeling of a 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí’s idea of making a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, consisting of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated on the design.
In fact, in their plans of the project appeared ornaments for the apartment representative of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the façade.
In the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol’s successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Mila and the Güell de Gaudí Park, in which there are other pieces of the same.
Due to its organic shape, the locals soon after its completion called it "the house of the bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it "the house of the squirrels".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, appears the sword of San Jorge, patron of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of construction conceal religious motives.
Gaudí projected in the house a unique system for the central heating era with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
It can be strange its inclination of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect at all the construction norms of the time and was not influenced by them.
Still, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although obviously in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the town hall was so impacted by the result that it requested correction.
It bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even to the public lane.
Arrangements were never made, rather the opposite: only fifteen days after the request of the town hall, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two tallest floors of the building.
In the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry.
The six-storey house is completely crossed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all the angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked on the modern concept of connecting space.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the lounges and a larger group can communicate in this way smoothly, without giving up the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí's reconstruction, not only obtained a new façade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with the light, white and blue tiles covering the inner courtyard and sunglasses.
The game with the two colors provides the maximum of light on all floors of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which, on the contrary, absorb the rays of the sun.
Anyone can visit the House of Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and recharged apartment of the accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and expanded the visits to the common area and the buhardilla, including the roof terrace.
The price of entry to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount significantly exceeds the entry price of Gaudí’s other buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly make friends with some neighboring house resident and visit him at home.
How to choose the mattress and the dreamer: women and men are looking for different things
Nothing of a pumping frame for the bed; what really confers its quality on a good bed is the surface to bury, i.e. the mattress and the dreamer.
First and foremost, they must be perfectly complemented in order to be adapted to specific users.
During the selection, numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the dreamer are located is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that doesn’t usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they “heat” more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than regular polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them around more often.
If the channels of the center are not properly aired and, above, are on a firm base, they keep inside the moisture.
When choosing a bed, they also influence habits.
Those who have spent a long time abroad often wear a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower and harder surface.
“Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn’t sleep as well here.
"For their crooked shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
“This type of mattress is also recommended for people with diabetes who sometimes have problems with the nervous system, so they poorly receive information from the joints and skin,” explains Sylva Hadamczikova, who specializes in mattress furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italians Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to be able to appreciate the viscoelastic.
This “miracle” works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn around like after a hard game.
He just sleeps better.
Viscoelastic also acts as a protection against wounds.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to your height the length of your feet, i.e. between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example singles, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple rule can be applied to calculate the width: when tumbling mouth up, you should have your hands comfortably tightened towards the elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert from Cechu <0xC4><0x8C>alouník<0xC5><0xAF> to decoratér<0xC5><0xAF>, who has been dealing with the mobile theme of the ergonone in the special health of the dream.
In the double rooms, each needs its own dreamer and mattress, so during the purchase you need to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the dreamers at different heights, which is not always possible on all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with inner springs at least 15 cm, of which at least three cm are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softness.
“By touching it with your hand or by accommodating it on the mattress, the springs should certainly not be noticed,” Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a certain type of dream.
The fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and you can't wash your bottom, which is often done today.
And since each night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) tamiz.
For this reason, experts reject slogans that speak of a lifespan of the mattress up to 25 years or even a lifetime warranty.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, sellers give a tip: in mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully care for cleaning and washing the case, but better add a mattress protector that can be removed and washed easily.
Although zippered mattresses are currently manufactured in all their perimeter, so when they are opened they are left in two parts (something very important for washing and washing machine size!), their manipulation in larger models (and by one person) when lifting the mattress can look like a weight struggle and a weight struggle.
In bed, instead of a dreamer, do you have a firm table?
Never! Never!
As much for the beds designed for one night visits.
However, you should make (if you no longer have) ventilation holes in the table and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For sommers of non-articulable sheets and containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g., a combination of latex and coconut fiber) may be used, although it is always better to sommer with a larger number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar area can be re-forged and re-forged.
Articulated sheet sommers should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to reclining.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "round" perfectly the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is very important.
They are even remembered by the manufacturers of mattresses that, in the "males", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are cross-structure dreams or tabletops with the so-called multi-torsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the voltage is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that even if you use the mattress and sleep properly, if you use a bad pillow (large and "moulded"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can relax.
The appropriate recommended size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When tumbled sideways, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder reinforcement sommer or the softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses seem to have something to do with the original mattresses filled with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, organic mattresses are in fashion.
The oil-based raw materials, with which the polyurethane foam is made, are filled with natural oils, for example, rice or soybean.
In fact, almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
“Biologic, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only from materials of natural origin,” explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek of Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress shell, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with bristle plant extracts, so that the mattress shell absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer to "heat" the shell.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel more warmth.
The favorites now?
Cold foam mattresses, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, make them more permeable than normal polyurethane mattresses and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam stiffness allows you to manufacture mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where your head, shoulders and heels are going.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, as they are considered to be medical means.
The first to get this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and dreams.
Sometimes offers from manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second one is available for free.
The era of viscoelastic with an open cellular structure and high density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially, it emerged as a material for NASA, because during take-offs astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur is softened with heat and hardened with cold.
Therefore, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent wounds from occurring, although also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents are using people tracking devices to control their children
Fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them via GPS.
The system, originally designed for vehicle tracking, can also follow the movement of people and contribute, for example, in the case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatková.
At the moment, the device is about the size of a flashlight box, but will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people feared the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
“We’re all trying to say that it’s not a spy, but another way to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
“I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example, if they are put in someone’s pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases.”
“Most customers actually buy it for security reasons,” adds Pilin.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "cajita" is for and how it is used in case of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková warns that if the child does not want to take it, he will simply take it away.
“Even younger children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled.”
“Earlier, parents relied enormously on mobile phones, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device,” says Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
In his opinion, it is questionable whether in the event of an attack such a device is really useful.
“If it’s a pre-prepared kidnapping, the author will almost always check if the child is carrying some kind of electronic device that can reveal his or her location.”
"Now it's the phone."
“As the use of tracking devices expands, it will also look for them, as their sale will undoubtedly be done with a lot of advertising.”
“In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police,” the psychologist says.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised pedophile attack.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is destroyed immediately, its presence can be helpful.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period of time."
"If it suffers damage, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question."
“The most expensive devices have an integrated slope meter, so if the person simply slips and remains immobile, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In your opinion, a service of this type can be obtained even with mobile phones with navigation, in which only a special software must be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices of a size similar to a flashlight box or smaller sized mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Macro Weil’s Pilin, for this reason, tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not identify the device."
“Or identify him after some time, which can make the police save time,” he adds.
Even if the tracking devices are carried on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology that is used for vehicle tracking.
This is the position checking with a GPS system (used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough mechas to surround the entire Czech Republic. But it only lasts two years
The Czech army purchased 445 kilometres of mecha to capture explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence added 224 kilometres of mecha to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the service life of the mecha is two years, four at most.
The army bought the explosives mecha to the STV Group, a.s. for forty million crowns.
The General’s staff responded to MF DNES by justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mecha saying that soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometres of mecha per year.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnicians, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it was decided, however, that in such a case, said maneuvers should be carried out with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, high-ranking officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want exemption either from the Minister of Defence Alexander Vondr and the army captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could it be justified that the army spent sixty kilometres of mecha.
This is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have enough stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two mesh meters, the army would have sufficient stocks with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the engineer or special units) for the 225 mentioned above.
The soldiers of the quick-intervention brigade personally complained recently to Minister Vondra because they said they barely have ammunition for various weapons, so even money-based shooting practices are limited.
And let’s not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also can't understand that we are repeatedly buying such amounts of mecha."
"But it's your decision, and they'll certainly know why they act like that."
“For us, the military is a good customer that we, as a company, try to satisfy,” admits Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, STV Group’s commercial director.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek defended the hundreds of miles of mecha, saying he would have stockpiles of this “munition” for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, from STV Group, indicates that the mecha has a lifespan of only four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, two years.
“If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four,” says one of the soldiers who, due to possible military criticism, does not want to give his name.
Upon completion of their life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require an additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometres of mecha, he got a discount.
“They cost us 60% less than last year’s 244-kilometre order,” said Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Department of Defense’s shopping center.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of mecha from the police pyrotechnics, who remove the ammunition from World War II or left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask only the right amount to deplete the ammunition before its lifespan ends.
It was decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and, in addition, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of mecha can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in completing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem with the current one will occur: you will have to remove hundreds of kilometers of old mecha, which is now being purchased "barata".
So far I am still living from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
The fact of winning the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition helped Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun sell his hotel franchises.
The last edition, won the competition "Entrepreneur of the year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun of Liberec.
Its success story appears to be taken from a movie.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun loved to travel.
Overseas he realized that in Liberec there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he met with seasonal overseas jobs and a loan from the bank he bought a house that was half collapsed consisting of five floors.
Given that he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
“Currently, the quality-price ratio of the accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it,” says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
He started renting the first rebuilt floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned was invested back in the building, which gradually turned into a 54-bedroom pension.
Since then, in seven years in business, he managed to gradually open in Liberec four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tise, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,” said number one entrepreneur last year.
“This sale of licenses for the opening of hotels greatly helped to win the ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ competition,” added Pytloun.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice,” she recalls.
Definitely recommend to everyone who wants to try some company that participates in the contest.
But it considers that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live from the contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
“With some people I met thanks to the contest, I’ve started collaborating regularly.”
The reputation associated with success, in his opinion, also included employees,
In total, about 70.
“I’ve seen them show greater loyalty and they’re proud to be involved in something that has earned general recognition.”
“It’s not, nor much less, my own personal success, but it’s the result of the hard work of the whole team.”
"It is only my name that appears in the foreground," says today modestly Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had at Farmet
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, Farmet may already have gone through the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone "Company of the Year" contest last year at the "Slava House" in Prague.
The jury valued its efforts, with which it managed to turn a small technical workshop at <0xC4><0x8C>eská Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all of my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition,” said the winner last year.
The history of Farmet starts with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>’s father the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned from his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Shortly thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialized audience after achieving success in the media contest.
“Not only did our customers begin to consider the Farmet brand to be considerably better, but foreign partners also began to appreciate the collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year maybe it wasn’t just a sample of the euphoria of victory at Farmet.
It was also recognized for its commercial results until 2008 and, in part, 2009.
And it was precisely 2009 that was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
“We, of course, did not get rid of such a situation either.”
“Income decreased by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some layoffs,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must, at times, take even unpopular measures.
However, they monitored the situation and maintained the company’s profits, although at lower levels than before the crisis.
After all, where Farmet did not cut expenses was in research and development.
“With the grants we have built a research and training center, we have strengthened the presence in the international market and we have achieved magnificent valuations at national fairs,” says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenue increases again and, with them, the number of new employees.
“The new achievement hopes to bring a feeling of victory, but in a more calm atmosphere,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A survey that reveals ridiculous rules
The Absurdity Survey of the Year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He has already eliminated some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity Survey of the Year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents to which officials can access online.
The decision was adopted by more than a third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the social security administration asked for an extract from the trade register, although its officials could get it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
“The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer ask for an extract from the trade register when it checks the insured’s taxes,” <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ová said.
The objective of the Absurdity Survey of the Year is to consult the rules and regulations that must be respected by companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to try to eliminate those who are absurd.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny and it begins to create fans among the general public as well.
While last year’s edition had the participation of three thousand voters, this year almost reached four thousand.
And it’s not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations that need to be respected simply to trade.
“Perhaps in the number of papers needed for tax returns we are in the world first,” comments Karel Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplification of business standards has been a declared goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic is ranked 74th, i.e. eight worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated the same way every year.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmaoku.cz. The contest organizer then selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaoku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
He wins the absurdity he gets more votes.
For this year’s survey, more than one hundred submissions were made, in particular 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples were sent by both employers and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the contest was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for road and highway maintenance pay the fee or that employers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the 70 proposals for this year is published on the page of the contest.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held at the beginning of November in Prague’s Wenceslas Square, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, the event was attended by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
“Economic prosperity cannot be sustained if the state continuously puts employers in jeopardy, so my goal is to eliminate a minimum of thirty paragraphs each year that currently unnecessarily complicate trade,” announced Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in the wastewater.
In 2007, what bothered people the most was the employer’s obligation to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to attend a position at a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended second in number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the work office by their foreign workers from work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the so-called green card law.
And the third is the victory.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a fridge and two floor scales.
This year, the Ministry of Health issued a statement saying it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are evaluated.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny contest is the category called Enterprise Responsible for the Year 2010.
The task of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
“This is how we want to support companies that take care of the impact of their activities on the environment and that support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of Vodafone’s mobile operator, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel contest of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s edition of Vodafone Enterprise’s main competition of 2010, companies for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal were presented.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely from one to the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is for example about people with disabilities, in other of the personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of the company responsible for the Pardubice area is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main donor for seven years to sponsor children with disabilities.
In Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad, there is a stationery that is particularly concerned with the health problems of its workers, since they make up more than 70% of the staff; that is why it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc he won the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities have the smallest possible impact on the environment,” explains entrepreneur Milushe Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit in the region of <0xC3><0x9A>stí also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboard; in addition, it supports work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Persona in difficulty scholarship, which specifically helps the local Roma community," said Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, a representative of the company.
The laundry company Praní to <0xC4><0x8C>i<0xC5><0xA1>tíní in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive special bonuses that impact their pension funds, are also in a good place.
“We provide benefits in food, transport, improvement of qualifications and leisure,” says Josef Strapá<0xC4><0x8D>, from the construction company of Bruntál Czasch, winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the category of Corporate Responsible of the Year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Enterprise of the Year contest were automatically appointed who answered the questions of the registration form and sent it before August 15 to the organizers.
The organizers removed forms that were not complete or incorrect from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the contesting companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Company contest responsible for the year, but are not disqualified from the Vodafone Enterprise of the year contest."
“Individual nominations for this contest are not allowed, as this is a subcategory of the company’s main competition of the year,” explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose advisory.
Police arrested during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
Anti-corruption police have carried out several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives married a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the reimbursement of rights in such a way that the auctioned land was received by a precise interested party.
I had to pay Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. half a million crowns for this.
"For the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribe during a public auction and public tender," Pilsen chief prosecutor general Antonie Zelená told Pravo, adding that at the moment she cannot disclose any more details about the ongoing investigation.
Twenty-four hours later, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On the way in which it was able to influence the public auction, given the little official information, it can only be speculated.
The spokeswoman for the Lubomíra <0xC4><0x8C>erná Agricultural Fund responded to the questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and it was during a public auction.
“This is a customer, not one of our employees,” he said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>erná, the public auction is called "Call for the submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with land law" and is carried out when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These persons, during the call, offer a value greater than their refund, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
“Based on the bids, the order of the buyers is determined, and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the highest bid,” the Fund’s spokeswoman said.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had information on who was to be presented for the invitation to tender and, given that he was also interested because he had acquired various refund rights, proposed to those interested in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
So please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, there was so much money on it.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had special contacts at the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
He figured in the case of former PF chief Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has just obtained from the Fund land for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular in the place where a large road to the Borská pole industrial zone should be built.
Afterwards, he exchanged them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the very historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the town hall had to intervene because otherwise blocked land would avoid construction.
Families will have to pay an additional fee of several hundred crowns a month
Homes will have to pay since January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rentals.
Therefore, families will have to get out of the portfolio, starting in January, several hundred crowns a month more than now.
The price of electricity rises by 4.6%, gas by about 2%, in some cities will have to pay up to 10% more for the water supply, and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should be about 100 more crowns a year than it is now.
However, the main electricity suppliers lowered prices, as support for the production of renewable energy, in particular photovoltaic, has increased.
However, the gas is moderately warmed, especially at the time when the most heating is used and, therefore, the higher the consumption.
In this case, they should also have a couple hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are heated across the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The price rise is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about 50 more crowns a month from January onwards for central heating, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 more crowns a year.
Residents in Prague will also have to endure a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the lease of infrastructure.
If the rental does not vary, the Pragians will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4%.
The prices of 450,000 apartments rented in Prague can rise considerably, where regulation will end in January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 floors in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem, will increase the rent by up to 100% from January.
The company will bring to the courts those who do not agree with the new rental.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase by up to 10% next year.
Young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and ron. Beer is no longer in mode, because it slows down
Fernet, ron, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause them to end up in medical care young drinkers under the age of fifteen.
Children who end up being buried in the hospital continuously to overcome rescue are no longer an exception.
This stems from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drink beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes too long to drink them."
"Now fashion is strong alcoholic beverages," says Pravo the head of pediatrics at the Hospital Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice in central Bohemia, Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelikan.
“When they manage to get a bottle of your dad’s algae, it can be whiskey, but it’s usually a Fernet and vodka.”
“Vodka has the advantage of being lightened with juice and not smelling so much,” he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokeswoman for Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or Ron."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
“In some cases, they use the waiter they took at home,” Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikan, they are 13- and 14-year-old drinkers who often appear in hospitals.
Before Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times."
“She started at the age of twelve, when she was brought in with 3.5 alcohol in her blood, plus a mixture of ecstasy,” the department doctor said.
"He was at the Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice fair at some dance party."
“The interesting thing is that his mother didn’t even surprise him that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours,” the boss said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance towards drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of increasing alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts note that, in the case of children, it is not proper to speak of dependence.
“Alcoholic is a person who has had a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children.”
“In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment,” explains chief Pelikan.
According to the spokeswoman Jurinová, 40 drunk children were hospitalized in Motol's pediatric clinic this year until mid-November.
However, statistics show only those who come with severe intoxication and should remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after ambulance medical recognition, go home with their parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply gather after school and drink awaiting, for Pelikan there are three seasonal highs that should be mentioned: the witch day, the end of the year and the end of the school course.
"In such circumstances, they drink for the bad grades or, on the contrary, they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
“On the day of the witches I came to see up to seven drunk kids at once,” Pelikan adds.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer from a terrible home run.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that are missing from the body.
"They take it much better, because after a busy night, they get up well and it hurts nothing."
“They’re just confused about where they are,” says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose their good mood at least when they see the expenses they’ve generated.
The ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a serious patient room cost about ten thousand crowns.
“I’ve often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children directly how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend all summer in a young job so that you could earn enough to pay off that night,” added Pelikan.
Medical insurance, in your opinion, may be a regressive measure, which usually returns people the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the aircraft Casa C-295M, departed on Tuesday for Seville, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
This is the first time that such a device is in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad to perform practice or demonstration flights.
This is the L-159T1 twin-seat version, which until now was used by the Czech army and was still in flight.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are still kept at Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, the company Omnipol, already took care of them last week.
Jan Pejesk, of the defense press department, says it is not yet known when the planes will be physically withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the long-repaired aircraft, with no investment or additional contributions from the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 two-seaters were exchanged in their current state," he told Právo Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
He added that the army would not be left without two-seat aircraft, as in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for an amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 twin-seat devices.
One of the new aircraft was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS pledged that the aircraft would be added to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly indicates that EADS is the company that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and that they will serve for NATO pilot practices."
“It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework,” says Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The newspaper Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a House aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for an auction for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense direction states that the exchange promotes future exports of L-159 overseas.
The Czech Army acquired 72 aircraft to Aer and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
Buying a home airplane may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already sued the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by conducting a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Home aircraft and the last one is expected to arrive at Kbely Prague airport in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the ring indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the annular are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
“Our results indicate that the relative finger length can constitute a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to the age of 60,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, in particular if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, says Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, he monitored a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index finger of the right hand shorter than the ring.
They had the same chances of suffering from prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
For men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under the age of 60%, the reduction was 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knows the study, but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "completely demonstrated".
Czech Republic in the snow: D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, dawned on Thursday covered in snow.
The roads and sidewalks are covered mainly by compact snow and the quitanieve machines circulated throughout the night through numerous areas.
In the morning, the D5 road was closed between kilometres 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and cars, as well as the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Central Automotive Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
In kilometre 91 a truck crashed, in 93 two industrial vehicles collided and injured.
Several cars also ended up in the cage.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway in kilometer 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks crashed there.
Drivers must travel slowly after Brno in kilometer 190 or cross Brno and enter into kilometer 182 in Kyvalce.
There have been several miles of lockdowns.
There was also an accident on the D11 road, just next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and thermometers indicate -7 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
For example, blockages are being formed in Prosek, although <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams circulate with delay, for example on the line between Karlovo nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí and Nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí Míru.
At eight in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Due to the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three speeds.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travelers should check what the current situation is.
Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> airport closed from 11 a.m. on Wednesday until 5 a.m.
Currently, it can already circulate on most of the southern roads of Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brn<0xC4><0x9B>nska snow tongues are being formed, and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain routes of access to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko.
So far, connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
To clear them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment, it is not known when they will open to circulation.
In Hodoninska, caution is required in the area of the Bíle Karpaty (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region, which are a protected natural area, should simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
In the Czech Republic they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimeters.
In the region of Moravia-Silesia, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowfall gradually sends to the Czech Republic.
U.S. soldiers have a new “smart weapon”
The U.S. military is employing in Afghanistan a new “smart” weapon, currently known only by the codename XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that “change the progress of the game” would make its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely accurate targeting.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains actually causes it to work like a small grenade.
The missiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies who hide behind an obstacle, a wall, or a trench.
Without a doubt, a normal protection can not be used and, when you launch your killer rain from metal blades, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"Soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to it their laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise target point and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and tightens the trigger."
"Let's say we've measured 543 meters."
“When the trigger is pressed, the gun loads and launches the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, less one, two or three meters,” Audette says.
400 jobs are being relocated
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their place of work from their former office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer industry giant and its maintenance said on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the district of Nieder.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term another 100 more employees of the consortium, who had previously been spread throughout the region, will stay there.
The offer is highly attractive, in addition, the collective office at Astro Park will promote the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "in Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday caused joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt’s head of economics, Markus Frank (CDU), said that it has earned a “Global Player”.
This is a “magnificent recognition to the location.”
Fujitsu is based in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) lamented Fujitsu's decision.
The administration informed the city earlier about its intention.
“Of course we have offered the company our help,” Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, the economic motives resulted in the fall.
In this way, there is now a large empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope that the owner and the tenant of the building will be cooperatives."
The property previously used by Fujitsu on Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of a controversial project to build the spa town with the surplus buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the town hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is critical of the massive building that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and the level of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating companies, the software manufacturer for reserve systems, Start Amadeus, were installed, as well as then Siemens joined the computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, originating in Tokyo, is recognized as the world’s third largest IT provider.
It has companies, e.g. computers and servers, and also provides precise services.
The Rhein-Main-Gebiet branch is one of the largest in Germany, yet Fujitsu has the most business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is based in Bad Homburg in Frankfurt am Main, the following subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That’s why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The ancient complex of the 1920s, its name refers to its star-shaped plane, home to, among others, the central association of electrotechnology and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Anxiety is increasingly taking over WikiLeaks.
The Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Possibly behind is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, appears to be detained in England.
Wikileaks’ disclosure platform is always the target of criticism, ever stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former U.S. server and are currently searching for a homeland in Europe.
The well-known US senator, Joe Lieberman, calls on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s search list, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from Amazon server."
“Speak freely in the country of freedom,” the revelations activists said via the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon services website to deal with high access figures to the documents.
Wikileaks tweeted: “Perfectly, we’ll allocate our dollars to hiring people in Europe.”
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, CNN reported on a call to Lieberman’s office.
The presidency of the country’s Senate Security Council had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British “Guardian” reported.
“I wished Amazon had taken these measures before, before previous classified information publications via WikiLeaks,” the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also ban the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and unconsidered process of WikiLeaks puts our national security at risk and threatens life in the world," he said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to extend stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is being searched in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s search list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently classified research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls on a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's worried about Assange's safety, Hrafnsson said.
Thus, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains unrevealed.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to North America’s statements.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, claimed that the person responsible for Wikileaks’ revelations should be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, government adviser Stephen Harper said, ironically, on television, Assange should be “killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Between the White House and Assange, there is a huge dispute.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, described Assange’s resignation as “ridiculous and absurd” if she is responsible for ordering diplomats to engage in spying.
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website.”
The U.S. government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in a general way.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution at the National Center against Terrorism, was appointed an exceptional commissioner, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing “the important structural reforms” that are necessary in light of Wikileaks’ leakage.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that in order to take care of the security of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Ice Cream University" in Bologna, ice cream is prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice creams has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
The gelator and the gelator.
The gelatire prepares the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The glacier with a spatula removes the ice cream from the counter, spreads it over the bark and sells it.
To know this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the university of ice cream with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice creams has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more day-long special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in the house’s own freezer.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice cream.
This time they are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a California professor of this art, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something of her own within a few years within an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
The ice cream master Luciano Ferrari later explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is decisive not only for its good taste, but also for its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano doesn’t forget his training or the natto cover of the national superior house and especially of the south of the country: “Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that’s why every ball has something romantic.”
The first step to elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients: milk, nata, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large bakery, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it up to four degrees.
Then opens the machine handle and comes out a pasteurized white basic cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can the ice cream be made only with natural elements or without a stabilizer?
How can you let go of some cravings to try?
Luciano advises you to turn away from the trends of the time.
He who speaks of ice cream "not just natural ingredients", has best used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, gum gum.
Of course, you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, you only need to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a sound of granite ice cream.
Some variations in the base mass are allowed.
They use aromas.
As for the taste of the ice cream, Master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
"All suppliers will try to glue flavored ingredients into their merchandise."
"But they must experiment someday."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now the participants of the course can use the freezers.
Luciano allows them to make four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocca and avellana, with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
Knowing better does not necessarily depend on having more toffee aroma or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary that the oatmeal ice cream knows dry fruits, if it contains more oatmeal.
The working group produces the adorable kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the taste of the ice cream, says Luciano.
The preparation of ice cream is a problem of artimetics: the melocotone puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar ratio of the basic recipe needs to be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano draws out a utensil with which he determines the amount of sugar from the fruit types (measurement of the wine grower for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the account easier.
Making ice cream requires only physical application, as before.
Not only helps the tool for the automatic processing of the basic mass.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to a temperature below zero.
After all, all automation is left out in terms of the small paste.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his comrades from top to bottom with fruit purée, as if he were an uncontrollable mini-first giant.
“In all courses,” says Master Luciano, “it’s just a matter of time for something like that to happen.”
Inspectors in a Complicated Situation
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has infiltrated the industry experimenting with transgenic plants.
Currently, this issue is formulated by the group of experts Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory but we haven’t documented it well,” Christoph Then, head of Testbiotech, said Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, and another Efsa expert have also been employed for years in the Ilsi Association.
Consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has significantly contributed to Efsa’s verification rules for genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
The Efsa provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of Ilsi’s situation and imitate the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticised a collision of interests.
So, recently, a senior manager of Efsa went without the support or transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that her band.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were conducted by the General Office for the Environment as well as a clear-cut member of the EU parliament.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, is used, provided they are of high quality and technical, are ordered in a report.
Experts working at EFSA are not required to have any contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the U.S.
It refers to itself as a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without Lobby’s commission.
In this regard, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without researching food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not checked.
“We want to know what, for example, makes genetically modified corn in agriculture,” says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not deliver reliable results.
"If the risks are not searched, how are they going to be found?", asks the prosecutor, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck said the same.
She has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying, in the U.S. and in Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortiums.
For companies, critical studies are not generally published.
“Industry controls security research,” Hilbeck says.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday he was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba on his back.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to pour down a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart land never again was the same: Thousands and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was pointed out, most of the wing became debris.
Rotate in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, aged 43.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They shouldn't disappear."
He is enthusiastic: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he’s oozing the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what to do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former ammunition depot of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He bought everything that resulted from the demolition in Stuttgart.
“There would be dishonesty, they would grind the gravel or send it to the garbage shop,” he said in his office, a wooden house that once was a guard house.
He was insulted and threatened, he explained, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the northern wing to the demolition company.
He spoke to the enemies of the 21st S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could absolutely do nothing for the fall.
And when it happened, then it was most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilogram-cut mast, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a memory but also in the hope of being able to return it to a reconstruction.
Rongen had purchased 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
Approximately half is still in the forest, the rest was sold long ago.
Owner of gardens, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart stone of impulse long ago has become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
He climbs to his all-terrain, making a tour of his great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later in biology, he became interested in computers and eventually worked with stones.
And he's a lover of stones.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
He carries his treasures all over Germany.
He says he is the country's largest dealer of ancient stones.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic sandstones sliced.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge," he explains.
Calcium alba, yellow, warm, enthusiasm.
"My precious stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Note a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And it's still there.
"Beautiful travertine."
In the past, the massif belonged to the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine of the Stuttgart Police Chief, red granite of the St. Blasien church, toba of the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple set and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something was destroyed."
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave the stone dealer to do, in addition, a stonemaker, a sculptor, a miner, a glassman and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the man who takes advantage of the remains.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to be saved.
Struggle of Talents around Great Potentials
There is an active influx in the buffet.
16 students crawl around pancakes, tomato soup and sweets.
Braunschweig Technical University and car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In some sort of idea contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Competitively and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, come together in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Its mission: Hire students with the most talent from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the job market and are hired by others.
And as universities do not facilitate publications on their students’ abilities, they try to attract exceptional talent in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at Braunscheig Technical University, the consortium gains talent.
A lady of the staff department distributes pens, elbows and folders with the VW logo.
Explains to young talented students internships and jobs and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle from Braunschweig Technical University carries the project with VW.
See advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
“In turn, VW can meet students, look more closely at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers.”
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are so directly desired.
“The main point previously was in technical projects,” says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not, they have to advertise themselves and, above all, to get a highly skilled workforce.
All students in the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), in October there were 40,000 job vacancies for engineers.
And, according to the VDI forecasts, this vacuum of engineers will grow even further.
In the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of the talent hunt.
It organizes costly hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern yincan, where participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe the KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of election at the exit.
Only the cream cream of many participants goes to the U.S.
Universities are increasingly endeavoring to select and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the crowd."
"The simple journey alone was short for us."
For the Dykta hunter the notes give results.
“Until today we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants.”
“Some find themselves close to their end, and want to apply to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach on the campus, they are also hunting, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their work fairs.
"We're trying to get students in the specialized fairs."
“Something about Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, staff manager for Solarworld’s solar technology manufacturer.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company's website.
"It's very difficult to fill vacancies."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter path is the contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
“Teachers advise that you can practice with us or carry out your thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That’s why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, lane hierarchy and comfortable communication.
“A large consortium can’t normally offer it,” said Stübe, the head of staff.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, child support or good chances of rise.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what you ask the employee how satisfied he is with the work and the environment in it and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff member also expects extra points in her ranking for her aspiring to work.
“I think the applicant is particularly focused on the external ratings of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Arbeitgeber Branding Akademie advises companies who want a long-term strategy that gains a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves,” he says.
In the sector, it is called internal Employer Branding, also promoting corporate identity within the template itself.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a gang game,” says Kriegler.
Obama Stops New Oil Drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has emerged in these years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thereby cancelled its previous plans in an incalculable manner.
Also on the Atlantic coast, new drilling holes remain closed for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will be in force for at least the next five years, was the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in April.
Before the misfortune that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused America’s biggest environmental disaster, President Barack Obama had admitted new drillings in the western Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters wanted to reduce U.S. dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it has not been clear who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
A commission of inquiry commission commissioned by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various petroleum consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to discard a new disaster by employing tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible oversight authority, which after being charged with corruption charges has fallen into discredit, is undergoing reform.
In parallel, Obama announced that the lucrative tax gaps for oil and gas consortia would be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the Gulf will be reduced thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey conducted by the advisory company BDO - before Wednesday's mining ban.
The American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: “Nobody knows exactly what changes with regulation.”
Investments in new mining projects will be extended soon, at the expense of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water from the rivers is oil marble, smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of crude have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogonilandia.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is fine.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures reporters: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wandering in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not seen that brown oil spots float on the surface.
Earlier, I was picking up handcuffs here, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetlands by a broken pipeline.
Fish in the vicinity of the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach fish-filled waters: Which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogonilandia, is considered one of the world’s most populous regions.
On the path of the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat’s engine removes a brown boiler, which dives its hand into the water, will bring out some full of oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark straws, sadly insulating the palms that crawl and hang their palms.
In vain, bandages of birds are sought, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the outer barrier is silenced, a kind of ghostly calm from an earlier paradise with a smell of gasoline expands into it.
"What happens here is an ecological struggle," says Hurrian Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
There is a warlike comparison.
The area of the settlement of the Ogons has been a thin battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers broke down more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to put his first factory Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for them.
The return of the companies to Ogonilandia is still prohibited today: While they pumped daily more than two million barrels of black gold from the whole delta region, a size three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields were too large for the oil fields in Ogoniland.
Every two hundred meters, steel platforms stood out as stunning water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
At every moment a head fails, Akpobari says, then mana a constant jet of oil in the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres have been spilled into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the failure of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the largest ecological disasters in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the sustainable environmental region will deal with it.
While the Shell consortium and organised oil thefts are responsible for over 90 percent of pollution, ecologists see headaches to break and leakage pipelines as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the world to conventional ones, the scientist Richard Steiner blamed the consortium in 2008: Only pipe defect rates are "on a greater multiple than elsewhere."
In a place, which from afar seems forgotten, appears a workshop full of oil under the open sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered in oil.
Among the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the perforations, sometimes arbitrarily scattered over the ground, is a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is heated in the fire for more hours, Michael, the group’s head, explains.
First, the gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the container, later the oil pipeline drops and finally comes out diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-litre barrels of diesel daily: “It brings us 34,000 naira,” about <0x24>22.
The people of the delta take advantage of the fuel shortage in one of the largest oil states in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap diesel price of just 40 euros-cent per liter, illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", who called the pipeline network through Ogonilandia: According to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil are lost every day throughout the Niger delta.
Only a small portion of the stored provisional raw material is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and high military officials, store the best part in Algebra and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Akpobari considers the debate purely academic about whether the environmental disaster is rather due to the management of the population or the slow mode of production.
“If the oil tankers did not act as invasors and had not completely destroyed the fish’s natural habitat, there would be no sabotage, no robbery, or illegal refineries.”
While the conditions of the ogons are shattered mainly by Shell to the point that only a consortium deduction appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as China."
Michael's getting nervous.
"It's time for you to disappear," says the muscular <0xC3><0x96>lmann.
"Soldiers can come in any minute."
If the special unit of the army catches the illegal refiners, it does not threaten them with arrest, if not with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
“This damned invention has completely broken our country,” Akpobari says.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a major security problem.
In an investigation into a machine that conducted a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which could produce "a catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas Airbus passengers who landed an emergency in early November were far more fortunate than they could have imagined: Australian air safety authorities perceived a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s thanks to their investigations, and warned of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a hose connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB authorities announced in a report published Thursday.
This could have caused “a catastrophic engine failure.”
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline starts legal proceedings against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit at the Sidney federal court that enabled further legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
The engine brand has lost parts and its wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers have announced that they will carry out more safety tests to superjumps equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, ATSB spokesman.
The security issue has become important enough to inform all affected people.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on the ground for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained approximately three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa repeated the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-covered plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
A nationwide snowfall causes traffic chaos
Totally white Germany: From day to day it has snowed in almost the whole country.
In many streets, chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter heats up Germany: Almost the whole country reached frozen temperatures on Thursday night, which has triggered traffic chaos at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a layer of snow 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and many streets.
On the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the ski lifts are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong wind rows bare the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects live tides with the water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein.
In Saxony, the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on national highways and roads.
According to the meteorological service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsische Schweiz, in fact the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of newly fallen snow and cold and strong winds take care of it.
There were many trucks and cars trapped during the night.
In Saxony Anhalt, police have also reported major street riots.
On the A2, snow and wind paralysed traffic and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall hit the A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disturbances are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The snow on the road, the fallen trees on the lanes or the broken chain and the holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop their trip to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service attended the 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
Winds with snow bare the streets.
At Germany’s largest airport, snow winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokeswoman for Fraport, there are already 40 flights cancelled.
The snowstorms are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers at the airport, despite that there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
On many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a trucker died in a collision with a train at a crossroads in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg because of the snowy streets: Also here a truck was reached at a crossroads because the vehicle was torn down.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after taking a ride with her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have a good news: Snow will become softer and dusty and will therefore melt into soft cracks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutschen Bank set up its headquarters: The twin towers were modernized in the district of the Frankfurt banks; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to take advantage of the costs of the renewal, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" claims based on a spokesman.
The spokesperson does not specify the reasons for the sale in the project.
“We always check whether it is appropriate to own or sell the properties and then rent them again,” he said.
That’s why Germany’s largest credit institution resigns from its company headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the investor of a house fund and then made the relevant arrangements for it.
Energy reforms amounted to approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
A sale would be a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field calculate the value of the newspaper’s towers renamed as “Greentowers” at around 500 million euros.
If renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been disclosed at the moment, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people mourn for the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
However, the bodies have not been found, as security measures remain precautionary in place of the misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion at the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced in place of the misfortune, but found no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment was able to drop for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts concluded that there was no possibility that the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Currently, family and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative event.
Ten thousand people have changed with the bright sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand's southern island.
They keep silence for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal objects, under clothes and surfboards.
The flags waved halfway through the country’s government buildings.
New Zealand expected the miners to return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," said John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, to the participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative event.
In the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the abrasive temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, Gary Knowles, the top police officer, told reporters.
Damn it, warrior!
Does the gore fit in the art film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-exploring gender boundaries with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
In what audience will the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he filmed Wallalla Rising?
A single-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and tear his body apart from his tri-enemies.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it’s actually called, doesn’t say almost any word throughout the film and the other characters get carried away by as much as one or two sentences or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise, they are silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the backdrop offers to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients, it is a pity that they cannot be mutually discarded.
The director Winding Refn views his wildlife and the drug-trafficking hairstyle "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stistically refuses to make his works for all audiences with a little more humor in the mainstream or a little less brutality of the artistic house.
A brain mass and a bursting throttle can’t distract most artistic cinema fans.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo catches a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck for an eternity in the calm and fog before his team arrives in America and shut up there again.
It is a pity that "Wallalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only available on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, there is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, it’s all about atmosphere, a febrile dream transformed into film.
And that’s why there’s no escape for the spectators.
Refn is condemned for just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the lugubrious trance soundtrack make him a nudge in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a little blonde young man, who faithfully supports Unojo, retains something as innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for interim enemies and allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It represents the loss, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to be angry, altered and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Earth Movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new clues to a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this subject until controls are allowed.
On the midnight night of September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates River; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which talks about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with North Korea’s help in the cube, hidden in a valley that exits the river.
According to information from the U.S. International Intelligence Service of the CIA in late April 2008, a current reactor under the name of the Kibar proximity is designed very appropriate for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are constructed.
Instead, the technique hardly serves other purposes than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from nearby or from the inside.
The reactor had recently been in operation, he says, but was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is barely more known than by then, the enigmas became larger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently uncovered in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was totally certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in Kibar, but that he barely saw signs that there was a “nuclear weapons program” in the country.
In Europe, several intelligence agents prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about a “reactor assumption,” although they consider the CIA’s presentation “plausible”.
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how certain it was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior U.N. diplomat said in the summer that the IAEA had “enough material to ask questions.”
The Syrians quickly cleared the debris of the alleged "unused military building" and cleared the ground.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by humans.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, from commercial vendors in the moments immediately after the attack, which must have a higher informative value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always made it clear that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built a nuclear reactor.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as unlikely after particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to argue about it, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, drivers are prohibited from a second inspection at el-Kibar and from entering the bombed building ruins.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
“We will never comment,” Ehud Olmert, the prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "progressively turns into a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place at the IAEA in Vienna, finally a serious violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty is pending.
The IAEA considers three more equipment as key to progress in clarification, which must be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor, and others such as these still exist.
Inspectors have not made public until the time of which equipment they are concerned, nor what functions they have, nor if they appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from the nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these sites and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is very likely to be one of the suspected objects.
Possibly located in or immediately next to a military base, Syria for this reason prohibits entry to the three IAEA sites.
In Vienna, it is said that Syrians fear a record that the U.S. has asked the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment thanks to U.S. secret service warnings.
Through satellite photography, IAEA has indications that material is being moved between the three sites and the cube to the bank of the Euphrates River.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the teams could be “related to fuel production.”
But there is "no sign of sensitive activities", uranium enrichment or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should subsequently be separated for the pumps, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is no doubt about whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can be recovered, are found in all three places.
As the hundreds of cargo trucks have disappeared from the ground, no one has information about where the rubble remains.
The IAEA considers unlikely the al-Tibni salt mine, located a few kilometers from the Kibar to the other side of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for their aptitude as a zone for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the IAEA’s former inspector, linked it to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the prestigious Jane’s Intelligence Review magazine.
But photographs from the orbit show that the Syrians carried out land movements in the three suspected locations and removed large containers after IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence, but it just helps dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that IAEA has taken a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which the Syrians would allow, to maintain possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors’ interest.
Meanwhile, Damascus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter doesn’t have much urgency, a couple of months ago, Glyn Davies, a kind of U.S. ambassador shrugged the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the nuclear authorities have to stabilize the controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "a choice that I am open to in the future", but still hesitant.
This path is very risky: It requires the majority of the IAEA Governing Council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat thought, "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in times of war
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started her debut with the director still unnamed.
She has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
Not much is known about it, but this is enough for the agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavia War.
Bosnian women’s associations have quickly protested, with which at the last moment they moved some planned shooting days in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women’s organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, Jolie is the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She is not diplomatic, she was offered a meeting in Hungary weeks ago that she refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie’s position about the victims delights enough on the script.
Her organization, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended that Jolie be deposed as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture who read the script, granted a footage and slowed down a recording permit in Sarajevo, it is not entirely clear why Jolie didn’t go despite everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, introduces herself with great effort into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrific consequences of the war and give voice to all parties involved.
Its content is still inaccurate.
A second synopsis of the film sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the war began and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnian, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant “victim of rape falls in love with torturer.”
It is certain that Jolie’s film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Nowadays they can achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script is still on the net illegally, like many others previously.
Nothing as far from here
This afternoon is finally good for the Irish.
No Traces of Affliction
Instead, the home team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans shout with joy as they shake the loud music, hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in the South Korean Cork, because players throw, and find, ping-pong balls to beer jars from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few airline tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beerpong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this stunning drink game and the discreet computer really don't make good jokes.
And the 26-year-old boy tries to have fun with that, distracting himself from the flickering question, what the future will bring to him.
The fun in Las Vegas is not on its agenda, it will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand in January.
“I have a bad feeling,” he says.
"It's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: Her girlfriend is waiting for her in Auckland, "from a shot she got the job of her dreams as an event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, her brother Colin currently works as an IT advisor in London.
Young people go: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, economic experts and the social research institute ESRI in Dublin predict.
As of 2015, there are 200,000 migrants.
A big loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
Forecasts confirm that there is a similar wave of migration to that experienced by the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, the melancholy is now expanding.
The economic crisis mainly confuses young people, well-trained Irishmen, for whom so far, everything is up.
The job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
Everyone needs to have plenty of money.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and thereby to an entire generation.”
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future emerge because the government is only dedicated to assembling and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they don’t have strategies to achieve new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
Observe how your peers go from unrecorded practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon are trying to see this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the theme of working abroad.
“For those who are starting to work, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to lead your career,” the manager says.
His website shows photos of a boy surfing in Australia and another snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleries, unless it involves freedom and fun.
For half a year, Sean O’Donovan has known what it’s like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
They are now building a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January you will go to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O’Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime to be able to pay a loan for his home in Ireland.
“The situation is a little crazy,” she says, as she long ago walked the threshold of her house for the first time.
“I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I’m never that good.”
She laughs a little embarrassed and goes through frozen rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O’Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>380,000, 100 per cent financed by a loan.
“It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves hotter tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer doesn’t like the complaints he often hears nowadays.
“No one should go hungry, our situation is, with a lot of difference, as dramatic as it was in the past here on the island,” he said.
“Working a season overseas is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe it makes us feel like Irish for the first time.”
He laughs and tells of his father, who in the last major economic crisis left for England.
“After seven years he came back and life continued in Ireland, very simple.”
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future behind and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He worked in London for a couple of years, and why wouldn’t he and his girlfriend go well in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that worries him so much: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
I'm afraid I could degenerate at a farewell party.
“Only, not too many emotions,” he says and gives a great drink to his beer.
"Shut up, sounds very anxious."
"We better call it a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
It continues to increase support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private enterprises.
Crime is more worrying than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it enables monitoring of attitude changes in the region.
The results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively animated humor reigning in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a decrease of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a major decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents from Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see graph 2).
Approximately 44 per cent of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than 25 per cent in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% said they trusted Congress in their country and 45% in their government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has persisted during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries have only been affected by a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has contributed to protecting the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only marginally in 2009 and that it has fallen again this year, to 32%.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see chart 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, most surveyed in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see graph 5).
Approximately 31% say they or a close relative have been the victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has declined since 38% last year and is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in greater support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say private enterprises are essential for development, while in 2007 it was only 56% (see graph 6).
Around 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, compared to 47% last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela believe the same thing (and 80% support private companies), although their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (against 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% versus 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to garbage
No one expected the general elections held in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
However, they went much worse than foreigners feared trying to help the country go back to their problems.
Votes were introduced in the polls, some people voted several times, papers thrown in the sewers, destroyed electoral colleges and acts of intimidation.
Election schools opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around the area trying to figure out where to vote.
Some of them, in the end, were defeated.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the UN's top official in Haiti, said it was "relatively good elections in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said, cautiously, that “we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious they may be, necessarily invalidate the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and with its candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
It is anticipated that the decommissioning will take place in January.
Not all hopes for the elections have yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial request in which they requested the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has barely any support, has moved to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic ravages the country and more than a million earthquake survivors continue to live in shops, a large abstention is expected.
The time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
Approximately 250,000 identity documents, needed to vote, had not yet been distributed just before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
The donors consider that the election of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And, as it has become clear, the Haitians themselves think so.
Advancing Points to the Center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, up to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
In spite of all this, that she can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in the elections next year will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs. Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to take over economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernández’s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner’s death due to a heart attack on October 27.
Some discrepant members of the ruling Peronist movement have faced Ms. Fernández.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one MP punched another in the face and other MPs accused the government of bribes, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Accordingly, the 2010 budget will be applied next year, which will offer the President an even greater margin of action when it comes to spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to union wage requirements, place it at around 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and made INDEC, the institute of statistics, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now moderate these policies?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, their officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the boost to growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that’s why Ms. Fernández is giving signs that she wants to restore Argentina’s financial ties with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with bond holders who had refused a forcible pre-structuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
Currently, it seems that Ms. Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditors governments grouped at the Club de Paris, to which she owes around <0x24>6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this would not involve IMF oversight, as is usual.
Last month, however, Minister of Economy Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new national consumption price index, which appears to be the prelude to the cleanup of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernández wants to continue in politics when her term ends, given that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has been tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have declined.
If you want to win other elections, you’ll have to decide whether or not you’re reluctant to reject many of your husband’s policies.
The Middle Hurricane in China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about her big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible, came on November 27 to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a defender of feelings for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but for a little while.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to get the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PPD), which has been inclined to complete independence from Taiwan, got almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it were the presidential elections, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of votes of his party has declined by around 8%.
For the first time, the PPD empathized with the KMT in the town halls.
In the elections, you could see the typical elements of Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with flags and light clothes girls dancing.
There was no shortage of a mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, hurting him and killing a crossing.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to hurt Lien or avenge himself on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PPD leader, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean on the KMT.
Perhaps the only major winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that this was not the case of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Therefore, the KMT often avoids advertising its ties with the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging sentiment against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan’s economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, said that his policy with regard to China had been confirmed to be acceptable to most Taiwanese people.
The Beijing Government is expected to continue to subdue them with trade, in line with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the grid.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would also like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
The best thing is to wait for the 2012 presidential election to take place.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned on corruption charges.
Between 2000 and 2008, he openly promoted explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs. Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing its best to demonstrate that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for the creation of a group of experts acting as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be conducted without preconditions.
Mrs. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry at the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that PPD candidates would have come out better standing if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to be presented to the presidential elections.
Even without Mr. Chen intervening, the PPD will have difficulty choosing from its potential candidates.
The KMT should also take a conscience exam.
Mr Ma’s ratings have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity appears to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said it would restructure its office, as well as local teams.
Large samples from the PPD suggest that Taiwan’s support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Artist Revelation.
Act at the request of a president and maybe people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at her 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammys’ surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Revelation Artist.
Considering that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination gives what to think, but respects the Grammy rules that it must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", undoubtedly represented a great breakthrough and, taking into account his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influences of pop, funk and Latin rhythms, can at least concentrate a distinction between Spalding and the path to success for the last of the 2003 Norah Jones.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity", an exciting and magnificent record that was one of last year's favorites.
Iyer's competitors include veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a New Orleans stud favorite and regular guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the category of contemporary jazz, which in turn leaned considerably towards fusion as in the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society's wild punk earned merited recognition in the big group category, competing against the big camera jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever-risked Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of his demo-star leadership.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in Best Director for Classical Albums
Classical music nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for three movements eclectic orchestra.
Among the nominees with links to southern California are the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his No. 4 symphony, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories covering orchestra, opera, choir and solo albums.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for the No. 3 and No. 4 Symphonies of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" for the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" artist; Vercrinis for the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Vogyrati.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" from the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin.
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Passionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes long, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for it to be played in mandolina Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"The song was composed with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez was nominated in the orchestra function category for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
The instrumental soloists nominated include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees for vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula gets the approval of the commission of ordering
The mosque project for Temecula has obtained unanimous support from the local ordering commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and lockdowns.
However, the committee members decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christian and Jewish or Bahá'í, from all religions," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley, said on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
"They only speak very loudly."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting started at six o’clock in the afternoon and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people speaking for or against the center, almost the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
“The United States no longer exists,” he said in one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of the Monkeys with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen".
Plans to build Islamic centers have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near zero zone, the New York area where the September 11, 2011 attacks took place.
In the Valley of Temecula, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of nearly 135 families has been living together in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse he rented in a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with an architectural Mediterranean style, would include two minarets and would rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the Municipal Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe poses the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients extends the possibility of finding new life forms on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers have discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it proves that there are possible forms of life without the main elements they considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
“That makes it very peculiar, though little missing, to be a really ‘alien’ way of life,” said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in the online edition of Thursday’s Science publication.
It has long been thought that there are six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you stand out as much as possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on different planets on Earth, as researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the convocation of a press conference to discuss the discovery, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated a great deal of speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements we consider indispensable to life might not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
“This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and the basic biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's astrobiology institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one another.
“Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to phosphorus.”
"As a result, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
“However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work as well as phosphorus, so it enters and, in some way, appeals to biochemical machinery,” explains Anbar.
The researchers picked up the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead poses the possibility that a form of life that uses arsenic can naturally exist, either in other parts of Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic can be replaced with phosphorus is not new, but an example has never been found to prove it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth eras, he noted, so researchers speculated that the early life forms may have used it.
“Yes, it suggests that there could be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Stolen dogs have been found missing in Compton
The two missing dogs were found in front of the Bellflower Motel, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Officers on Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgi, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck they were spending the night in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, officials said.
Two of the dogs recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found on Wednesday afternoon, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They have returned with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
“An investigation is underway.”
“We don’t want to say anything,” Whitmore said.
"We're following some clues."
Dog owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek were not found to comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not suffered any damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the area's competitions this week on behalf of Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were going to display them in other competitions scheduled for the days before the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the nearly two-month tour the couple takes part in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of their room.
They carried three other dogs (a boxer breed, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany) who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they had a very thick fur and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
Thursday was not clear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while MGM restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally got green light to start again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved a creditors’ “prearmament” plan to erase approximately <0x24>5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering movies and TV shows.
The ruling on Thursday confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles to MGM re-launching under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the top executives of what will be a reluctant study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not exit Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a <0x24>500 million planned credit instrument to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which itself is contributing <0x24>75 million, and is expected to be financed in mid-December.
The study’s restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management needed to order its finances, while struggling to be able to make interest payments for <0x24>300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and expert in bankrupt companies recovery, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial hardships and satisfy the more than 140 creditors in the study took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009 the parties agreed to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted a few posters and none were willing to pay the more than <0x24>2 billion that creditors were looking for.
Before spring this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received <0x24>1.2 million, will receive a payment of <0x24>9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have been collecting <0x24>375,000 a month for their company’s management services, will receive <0x24>4 million “successful fees.”
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and gathered an annual chart of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between <0x24>265 million and <0x24>275 million to finance its part of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep balance in their gift budget
While the iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant buck in their gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five <0x24>99 BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes decorated with bills, or about 48 Play-Doh cans.
But there are ways to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three domestic toy sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see which electronic toys I could buy for less than <0x24>80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s tech toy will probably have more power, costing the same and even slightly less compared to last year’s toy.
In addition, while there are usually fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the most well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And button-powered toys are increasing, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are for Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, <0x24>13, for 3 years and more) are pellets toys the size of a rabbit that sing a note when their belly is squeezed.
A squeeze is equivalent to a note, and a second squeeze begins to arm a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start squeezing, you can’t stop.
For singing combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, <0x24>60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking advantage of last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-shifting games like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative wheeled articulated feet with locking device.
Kids who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although his parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you’re a child of the 80s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, <0x24>40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of question cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correcting exercise notebook.
If you are reluctant to give your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech’s MobiGo (<0x24>60, 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although games don’t teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer (<0x24>70, 3 to 12 years old), it’s the first major development of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL (<0x24>90, 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (<0x24>30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a five-block game just bigger than a flashlight box, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to arm words by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out; it’s formidable for an improvised word armor competition.
More and more are the toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on its presence in toys, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, (5<0x24>, 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you exchange the code online, your child gets enough credits at the Penguin Club store for two items.
These could include skates on wheels or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the pig in its toothbrush, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the latest in a line of button-driven microrobots.
The fake insect moves rapidly over 12 silicone legs that vibrate, in random directions.
It’s fun to do a labyrinth of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It is also durable.

A more moderate side of order maintenance is promoted in China
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the passage on a square in the city, severely inspecting the nervous people in charge of him, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the cowardly policemen of China’s urban order, fearful and despised for their captivating measures and their tendency to violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Signs!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "How beautiful girls are!"
Four girls who barely passed their teenage years with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and adjusted pants to draw attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four stylish hats perfectly placed above the hair tied with blue and white stripes.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, disdainfully.
"Models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clear the image of China’s urban inspectors.
A city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the grey green color of uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating glances: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a shelf of snack cart, and watched it with a sniffing eyebrow constantly for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, expressly chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the police cough a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China’s slightest respect for these city squadrons.
And for a good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei Province killed a transient after using their cell phone to film them while disbanding a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a Beijing inspector training manual was stolen and published on the internet, describing how to effectively beat criminals without causing them to bleed.
This year, a street vendor of sandwiches in Shanghai suffered brain damage after a line with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar on the government," China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after another tactical controversy.
The newspaper called for “a really meticulous cleaning.”
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested through a notice of eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real duties or were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district’s announcement called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure “and the five harmonious facial features”.
They should have a height above average, more than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over the age of 25.
“His image is the important thing,” an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a nearly government website.
“First, the external qualities of candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc.”
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities".
Female chengguans are like florists, he said, adding, "in addition to being florists, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not anxious to back that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job notices for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means betting, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, the disabled or disfigured should not be presented.
“We can’t allow a person to catch or a robber to come to work here,” Mr. Zheng said.
"His image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his colored cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn’t think the emphasis on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy with this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His colleague with today’s people, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said “Our work must present the image of the city.”
They also don’t object to their fixed-time work, they said, because they house greater career ambitions than simply harassing sellers on the streets where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squad confronts more or less a dozen street vendors who throw themselves on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many pancakes or tofu bowls as possible before being thrown away.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning her bike-drawn cart with fideos seals.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhaustive.
“This is more or less the same every day,” said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his free time.
"Very routine".
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against the bureaucracy, which are common everywhere in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, were mutined after spreading the false rumor that Chengguan officers had murdered a salesman.
More than a dozen Chengguan police officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were shot or fired.
At the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calmness is barely guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle screamed loudly.
The situation stagnated for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened their elbows to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and their owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 or over, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said with total naturalness.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience who starts the fight.”
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have apologised to Senator John Ensign for criminal charges arising from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work by lobbying for the woman's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
The Ensign office said it was "probably pleased" with the decision, which came after a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Justice Department had “informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plan to charge him with this issue.”
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign may have conflated to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get lucrative job through lobbying, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, over the sin dealer.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under the law of lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were intimate friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the so-called “revolving door lobbying ban,” which seeks to restrict former state employees to use their connections to do personal business.
Of the evidence that has been made public, "it seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door status," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in defending government-investigated clients.
While the Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed cautious in accepting political prosecutions and after several miscarriages important for his section of public integrity prosecution, including the passing of the teed in the middle of the decision.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s chief attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call the following day, telling him that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
“I don’t feel comfortable getting into details about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, claiming that a <0x24>96,000 payment from Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got a lobbying job thanks to Ensign's help to Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign’s chief of staff, John Lopez, communicated with Hampton and told him that he was “mixing” the Interior Ministry on a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned from his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokesman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, she said the senator expected the ethics committee to quickly follow the Justice Department's example and conclude its investigation.
“Senator Ensign has a desire to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada,” he said.
Cheshire’s appeal will point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the rows of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the terrifying testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official ending, with the judge's death sentence being passed by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have filed court papers outlining the arguments of appeals that will likely occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created “a circus atmosphere,” and such widespread and immediate saturation with exasperating details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appeal judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
“According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual’s rights to have a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Chief Defense Attorney.
First-instance judge Jon C. Blue of the State Supreme Court laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the media were "meticulously controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been taken by passion.
But it probably won’t be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appeals courts have recognized that coverage of celebrity cases can raise questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a historic 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, stating in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the media communication process."
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general cause for concern about the impact of new media" in high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford School of Law, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make the trials more fair.
The issue of Twitter is just one of many topics outlined by Hayes’ lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes may have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential juries, showing them scary photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and their daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela.
Defence lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and will argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized the prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of intense process coverage can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a rejection of the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media were continuously throwing wood into the fire of emotion over the case.
"The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state."
Their focus on Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news was more important than the reports delivered more slowly, was a playful vision that would make the court's policy on coverage control weak in future trials.
But some lawyers said the appeal courts were often attracted to the arguments on the adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressuring for that claim.
In their writing, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which revokes Dr. Sheppard's conviction due to the coverage of the trial, and made it clear that they would require the new media to require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can civilization build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a notable campaign for invectiveness and negativity, this week has triggered a bit of civicism in Washington.
Is it a prelude to a genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to the party fight in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and Congress leaders did not produce any progress on the major issues that should be dealt with during the outgoing session.
But as everyone says, it was at least a courteous discussion about the differences between the two sides, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to win partisan points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit committee was equally civilized, despite the political differences that persist between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a trial period, probing each other to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
The reason why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent evaluations of the meeting by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and are deeply rooted to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two sides are on opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with respect to the way things are said," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“They are inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions, which then extinct.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment subsidies, probably because Republicans can’t believe they’re in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment subsidies for the unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s meeting at the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START nuclear disarmament pact (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continuous bipartisanism when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable, that a period of disagreement begins.
“After the things that have to be done are carried out, psychology will in the short term reverse the situation to a confrontation,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civilization can lead to true cooperation.
“I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a test for the 2012 main event,” he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know that they must try to keep their promises to cut state spending and repeal the new health law.
Those backing lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee, which include reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and the retirement age, and the cut in expenses.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been in charge of one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forcefully introduced the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resilience is among elected panel officials, suggesting that in tax matters at least at present there is little basis or desire for commitment.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and those of Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of partisan shocks, when Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and medical care, followed by a period of increased bilateral cooperation.
What would cause the change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead end, as it happened in 1995, then both parties will closely observe the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks they’re losing will likely change course and look for commitment.
However, this can be an optimistic view.
Partism and polarization are now larger than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort from both sides to find common points on issues that still divide them.
A leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a “cleptocracy,” and leaves part of the bribes and protection money that it raises directly to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service are handling huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every stratum of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called “vertical authority,” takes its part as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor of Moscow, and blamed him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have systematically denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won several libel claims over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he said: “It’s a madness, a patria, an annoyance.”
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of that it is the diplomats of a foreign country who do so.
“The direct links of the Moscow city government with crime have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional’, and to assert that the government functions more as a cleptocracy than as a government,” the statement said.
“The criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term of the criminal world and the mafia literally meaning ‘roof’ or protection) that transcends the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Home Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor’s office, as well as all sectors of the city bureaucracy.
“Analysts identify a three-level structure in Moscow’s criminal world.”
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
“The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level.”
“Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city does not provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS collects money from the largest companies, and that the police are targeting small businesses.
A source, the report said, explained that “Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get the protection of MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority.”
The note notes that while money collection is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly find their businesses closed by one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports about men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, within the Kremlin itself.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem expert group in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he is a part of this bureaucracy."
“He does not belong to a political class, because there is no political class in Russia anymore.”
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than <0x24>300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked at least the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not occur until late in Moscow, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow’s weaknesses, could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation claiming that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policies in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest with you, we don’t suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way.”
The veterans of the Red Jemers forced to face the past
In a weakly illuminated concrete classroom, with stained walls and debris, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Red Jemers.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok".
“He was a good leader and worried about his people,” said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the Carnicer" for his brutality during the rule of the Red Jemers, the commander remains popular in this remote former Red Jemer fortress in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of ex-soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemers surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed the victims to publicly confront the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Red Jemers to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations and Cambodia joint court issued the first sentence of a former Red Jemer member, sentenced to 35 years in prison to the former head of the known torture center, Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev.
With each of those events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Anlong Veng Red Jemers, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Red Jemers, but they can do nothing," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
“For them, life under the Red Jemers was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the government of the Cambodian Red Jemers, between 1975 and 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrown the government led by Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok grew followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Jemer fighters began to desert to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieuphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Red Jemer fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few Red Jemer elite officials retained their local administrative positions in exchange for laying down their weapons, the Racial Soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
“These people have gained little benefit after surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
“They were created without any concept of doing business.”
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemers as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
“Life with the Red Jemers was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone to eat."
“But now life is difficult because we have to self-sufficiency.”
The current court of the Red Jemers has also caused concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Red Jemer minister.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the leading leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This didn’t help much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in the Banteay Meanchey province during the Red Sea government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are believed to have died.
During a boring late afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden pilots on a ground road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows over the dry pasture, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemers.
She said that if the court called her, she would not be present.
"Cambodia is in peace and stability," he said.
“If there are more trials, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted the Red Sea in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, even though experts and historians question it.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk, of the documentation center.
“Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite the broken pieces,” he said.
“It is our duty to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved 75-page textbook on the Red Sheep, called A History of Democratic Kampuchea.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the high school history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Red Jemers.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little details about the Red Jemers, despite the city’s link to the regime.
Touche Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
“They have suspicions because they are not sure how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to produce an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Jemers retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many weeds and covered with disposable plastic bags leads to a black hole rectangle covered by a sheet oxidized roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a lot of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old cell phone salesman on the edge of the road, said she didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
“But he has a strong spirit and many of the locals go there to pray to him,” he said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot’s last rest, where he would leave a handful of mature bananas in hopes of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its reserve of uranium qualified for armament
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it would renounce its reserve of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement published after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of classified operations with Belarus have been carried out in the last two months, to remove 84.82 kg of qualified uranium for armament from a Belarusian investigation facility.
This prepared the ground for Wednesday’s deal to remove the rest of the material, about 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the matter.
The deal appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit presided over by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was apparently a good success to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This proves that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the deal was "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material around the world over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have retained highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially uranium qualified for armament) and low-enrichment uranium,” Lukashenko said.
“This is our raw material... we’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell them to anyone.”
“We use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating an interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was made by plane.
The U.S. government spent <0x24>13 million on tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with low-enrichment uranium research facility, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an energy department official working on Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen trust" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of qualified uranium for arms, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to remove its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential disruption.
"While progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus have recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish government did not make repairs to CIA flights
The Spanish government did not make reparations to the CIA’s flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners headed to Guantánamo on Spanish territory, the U.S. ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents filtered by Wikileaks in the newspaper El País, where it adds that the then first vice-president of the government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked for the Spanish Executive to be informed to “prove that they were exercising an appropriate surveillance of Spain’s alien aircraft.”
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe in which he accused about complicity in human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting took place between former U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council’s report “had taken the Zapatero Government out of the game” and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
“De la Vega stressed that Spain has no repairs to intelligence flights through Spanish territory.”
“They just want to be informed” to avoid being “unattended pillage,” Aguirre reports on a cable.
The then Foreign Officer, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive “would like to give this issue the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence.”
In January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of the CIA’s National Intelligence Center (CNI) and Department of Defense documents.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements or any sensitive information," the Embassy said after speaking to the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed its concern about the “appearing coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors,” rather than the unclassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manage the case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, at a lunch between U.S. Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although the Spanish judges are furiously jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had instructed his colleagues to try to "to avoid the temperament," he said.
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's action on this matter.
“Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that Zapatero’s government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government.”
Parricida confessed in the network of the "ago" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when she was already dead and had a blog: "Terror at the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the net.
With this surname, which she employed as a child, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natural ones of Noia, the crowned people from which she came.
The posts are from 2008.
To understand them, you need to know your romantic life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies from family members.
The 30-year-old Galician began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Tuñez, an industrialist.
It lasted a year.
When they left, they soon learned that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get a DNA test.
It didn't take long for another boyfriend to meet her.
The chosen was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, neighbouring municipality.
He lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came with her for a week in Palma.
But by the content of the communications, it is seen that his romance broke, which they broke.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and mosqued, because I came to work."
“When I said it seemed good to him, but of course, now he realizes what it’s like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
Then, he talks about a message to the phone he just received: “I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you to the child.”
She complains, “If she doesn’t like me to leave the cradle with my mother, I’ll pick her up when she gets back,” she claims.
In May, he talks about the return to his people: “This week I’m going there, but I’ll only be there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to present myself to a job so I don’t miss it.”
She explains that if everything goes well, she is taken to her firstborn.
"It's going to be with whom it owes, that is, with me, and in life it will never happen to me to leave it again with anyone other than my mother," he said.
In July, there is another post.
When he touches it, the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly killed on the 10th, is supposedly dead.
“Caesar is happy on one side, but not on the other.”
“On the one hand he’s with me and he likes the site a little bit, but on the other hand he’s going to class almost every day.”
It's about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He'll go there to some summer classes, and so I save myself a little kangaroo paste."
The 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss of Caesar, asking me when you come."
“Alberto says he sent you I don’t know what videos to the email, look how when he wants to meet me, you have to fuck him.”
The 30, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
Víctor, his current partner, has one: "He advances me money."
On the internet there are their posts on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
She even had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now intervening, where she was called "Muki the ex-prisoner."
"Terror in the Galician (epigraph) ".
The last man who lived with her, keeping a jury, declares his grief for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to believe it all happened because he didn't tell him he was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma, from the centre of judicial detention in Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the events happened, “nor did he intend to cause any harm to the minor.”
Earlier, he confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and depositing his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
People would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the important increase in votes and MPs experienced in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has the view set in the generals because, be it forward or not, the outlook is more than positive, since the number of votes this formation gets in those elections usually doubles that it receives in the Catalan elections.
Thus, the popular Catalan won 610,473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, the figure rose to 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC scored 384,091 votes.
To keep this trend upwards, which has been fueled by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now has 25) and the PSC would lose less than 9 MPs.
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one deputy — now it has three — while ICV would stay with one deputy or win one.
But, to keep the electoral calendar, the most immediate meeting will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in ending socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its relief to the head of the Diputación de Barcelona - one of the administrations that most manages budget for 6 million euros - 2011.
Both nationalists and populars agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be unthinkable that this formation loses its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can star the coup in the capital Tarraconense, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they were found several times.
Popularity has also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
Catalan Cell Provides Thousands of Passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the Police Commissioner General of Information in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, headed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the East Tamil Land" (LTTE), and "Laskar and Taiba's Last Cause of the Dead" (Laskar and Taiba).
The Interior Ministry has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "Operation Kampai" has been "weakened" the Al Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus at the international level and, therefore, "his operational capacity".
The researchers calculate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were counterfeit and then distributed to the groups that integrate the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" can cross European and other western borders with total impunity.
The detached cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, hence, in addition to Thai services, other European police units have participated in the investigations, so it is not ruled out that in the EU territory are carried out in the coming days similar blows to those developed last night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis were detained Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Butbabatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand another was developed with the capture of the Tahitians.
These were the ones who ran the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole tourist passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents should be on behalf of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
The media underscores that at the moment no data has been found linking the detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the perpetrator of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the stolen passports in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency some <0x24>1,000 that were “invested” in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by members of the “command” that ended the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized plenty of documentation.
The PP demands Mas to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and to dispense with adventurists in which he is the son-sober.
The president of the popular Catalan came to the meeting of Artur Mas with the certainty that he had gotten 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a figure more than enough to make himself want, as the candidate of the CiU needs that at least one of the formations that will be exercised by the opposition abstain in the investment vote.
From a possible agreement with the PP depend the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but, at the moment, the conversations that Mas holds these days with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, in support of an investiture "there will be a need to park all the sovereignist and independent speeches", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to a referendum.
Both leaders have in common their commitment to slimming the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of the succession and donation tax.
The details of the Mas investment negotiation will be handled by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciudadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidarity Catalan).
The geriatric says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that their cellar killed more than 11 elderly people.
The leaders of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage to the institution caused by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while he was employed there killed at least eleven seniors he had in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the center’s lettering, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that “the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the charge against the responsible” of the deaths but “legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials.”
And it is that in addition to the social disdain that the entity may suffer for not detecting the criminal activities of the cemetery in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims’ relatives are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and has not stopped killing since then.
The judge already pointed out in the car that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally examined the deceased but that, taking care of the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by telephone.
The charity, through its director, yesterday roundly denied this extreme and pointed out that “the lack of measures could not have been at any time the cause of what has happened.”
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there is no single indication in the case that there has been a reckless action on the part of anyone other than the accused himself."
The already-baptized "Angel of Death" confessed 11 murders and detailed that the first crime committed on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by pinching him an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed with the help of a mix of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the center staff have access to the medicines.
Insulin clamps and sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his longing to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to put them to death.
But it will be the tests that are being done in the lab that will need to clarify whether Vila did not lie and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, she embraced them inside by giving them lye as she has already confessed that she did with the three women she killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the demonstrations of the cellar, nor even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that it is superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having committed murder, with exisina ochsina.
That is why they say they make themselves available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB is threatening
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet’s threat yesterday warning “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
Peripheral differentials have tightened and European banks’ shares have risen by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ECB’s ability to make mistakes and the euro has barely rebounded, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market as it collapses is recovering but motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take a long time to lose fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded to finalize the ineffective public debt purchase plan and eliminate all extraordinary liquidity measures in the long term and leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect that current liquidity measures will be extended “at least until March” and keep the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect you to continue with your bonus purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they are still obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God assists us!
Just like at their May meeting in which they said they had not even contemplated buying bonds and collapsed markets, tomorrow the story could be repeated.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, Bazuca announced Monday and Wednesday said it had already bought a lot, causing a new market collapse.
Yesterday’s one-year letter auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Yet the rates in Portugal fell 30 basic points throughout the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The figures are estimated to be about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to get private capital or remain nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress tests, the figures are reasonable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it still has not enough support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease tensions ahead of the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14th, in which a political commitment is needed that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the president was given the opportunity to present yesterday the action plan that will be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish stock exchange has risen 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been quick and convulsive and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key three-year bonus auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we expect it to be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain, asking for an aid plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don’t need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available triple that in March, at very expensive rates and closes you access to the markets sine die.
However, the strategy must remain that of the woman of Caesar, "in addition to being it, to be like it."
Yes, we can.
Eulen’s president will challenge Vega Sicilia’s board requested by his children
The temporary does not melt in the open conflict in the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, by considering it "zero of full right", the judicial board of El Enebro next day 16, requested by five of its seven children and in which they will try to make their majority valid and make themselves with the management bodies of the holding firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jesus David and María José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their dispute over control by the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding to the company does not appear willing to cede in its litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was dismissed by five of his seven sons who were appointed directors in the shareholders’ assembly on January 18 of this year and whose appeal is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next 16th day, convened by the Magistrate of the Commercial Number 2 of Madrid, has reopened the box of the thunderbolts within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to determine the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the board.
The latest movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate remedy of the applicants his five children to, by procedural argument, in clear fraud of law and abuse of law, try to validate and sanitize the official board according to their 18 lawsuits.
This argument will be the basis for the Board to proceed with its appeal once it is considered to be "zero of full right".
The same protagonists, who keep a discreet silence, have already unsuccessfully tried the magistrate to convene a council in June.
In El Enebro, a holding company owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven sons of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This is the substantive matter that the judge must decide once the hearing on the appeal is held, for which there is not yet a specified date.
Red Bull wins F1 with a Siemens secret weapon
A software designs real-time improvements to cars.
Since Red Bull broke into the Formula 1 world in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one considered the options of a newly arrived squad and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship everyone bet on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without demeaning the skill as the driver of the final champion, German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the “secret weapon” that the multinational Siemens has put into Red Bull’s hands to make it a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes far away from the high automotive competition.
Designed PLM, this powerful computing tool has been used to design assembly chains from manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before constructing it in a real way, thus avoiding faults and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computing instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out “in just a few hours, almost in real time” the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the squads in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team today employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications to the bolts.
The Siemens executive explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull bolts with the exception of the engine, which is entirely Renault’s responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be brought from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser and high-tech autoclave production systems.
The only limitation to this madness of technological development is the <0x24>40 million each Formula 1 team can spend as much as possible in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has assembled the high-tech plant to design and produce its boilers in a town about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered “high secret.”
The team has 580 people, including their two drivers, champions Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy beverage brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and its notoriousness zero.
The company’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, said five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in trolley cars accounted for 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have varied and technology adds 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15% of added value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers as “they are unpredictable gladiators.”
HP Will Install 20 Own Stores With Local Distributors In Two Years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive shop in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 stores of between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain’s vice president, Helena Herrero, set the example of the refurbished store on the Gran Vía Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom he has been collaborating for 30 years.
The American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
HP’s also director of personal systems said that the philosophy for installing stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with industry experience and knowledge.
The American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of establishment staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in purchasing, care, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering global pilot program that is in charge of solving the potential problems of HP’s computer equipment in warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
“This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, as large companies already have contracted technical assistance services,” Herrero said.
Sabadell bets on stealing a million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell’s CEO, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liabilities war.
However, it envisages a drop in interest margins, which will be partly offset by increases in commissions and the price of the loan.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years, its pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011, which will be valid for three years.
The goal, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share with the acquisition of a million new private customers - 700,000 if discounted on those who can leave the bank - its large pending subject, since so far had mimicked more SMEs and businesses than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the wager on productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as a target, and whose challenges the bank will expose when presenting the results of the year.
Few banks today dare set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has overtaken all the plans of the world bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close its executive plan Optima this year, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation has made it extended a further exercise.
Customers who let out of the savings boxes will be their main goal.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a “difficult and transcendental” year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the outbreak of the crisis in Spain will be “slow.”
In addition, in two or three years it will be “very difficult to create jobs”, something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the liabilities war – which penalizes margins – is decreasing, the price of the risk premiums that banks and boxes are paying for their emissions to get liquidity are already moving to the credit price to offset the drop in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and will be a factor of pressure on credit."
"We haven't closed the handle, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola said.
Banesto already gave orders to its network on Thursday to limit the long-term credit and raise the price of the differentials – see FiveDays of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the bank’s tendency now “is to raise commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell’s executive plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he assures that in Spain "larger sizes will be required."
“Next year will move everything,” he said.
It claims that capital needs are "very high" and does not rule out that any Spanish financial institution enters into red numbers.
And it points out that the FROB can supply the market in raising funds before new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell could survive the temporary closure of markets, it remained important to what some bankers already see as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but unlike what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which is dampening the crisis.
The ECSC discards a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, discarded yesterday that there would be a wave of mergers of savings boxes and reaffirmed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When he started the process of concentrating Spanish savings boxes, several entities ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Confederación Española de Cajas de Ahorros (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
“I think most of the mergers have been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Bank group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments.”
“Most of it is completely done; instead of 17 we may go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have already been done and are under the auspices of the Bank of Spain, which has contributed a lot to that too,” he said.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta has exposed that the process of concentration is underway "as quickly as possible, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is going to happen in the deadlines that in his day, not now, were marked in the business plans with Banfa.
“Changing from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion assets to 17 with 75.5 billion is an unparalleled process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to comply with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a series of rather unlucky opinions on the slowness of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most stringent financial system in all of Europe and “probably” in the world, and attributed to those who put it on trial a “lack of knowledge”.
The executive pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings boxes, a system that has undertaken a "very important" concentration process and that "goes as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank went very well out of the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have led to a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private agencies of placement or suppression of the 426 euros of aid to non-provided stops, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat 30%.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticisms of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to trigger the current crisis.
How do we interpret these movements?
Keep in mind that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another turning point in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which collides with maintaining the old traditions of many of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now resemble science fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines to offending countries, possible suspensions of payments to any of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defining for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating the deficits, the German government pulled out a constitutional reform to stop them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed to be done (plans of fiscal rigor and stability in public finances), and what their European partners were practicing, including France.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended Greece’s rescue decision.
Already he was subject to fierce criticism at the time, but the truth is that political consensus in Germany and public opinion and published opinion were strongly opposed to Greece’s rescue.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the EU treaties, to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But your proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should be attending the reform process of the Union that will enable those measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if there is now a need to take measures that he may not agree with very much, from that date the old functioning of the euro will have ended.
The year 2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which offending countries will be severely penalized, may be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments, and in that case the private sector will also suffer part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a strict path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand it.
It is not just about bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is deceiving ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will lead to greater tranquility.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity that they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his dual manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis that order must be put in place has opened its way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it does not appear to be moving.
And, among the possibilities that are envisaged, that of leaving an overly crowded monetary zone from less serious countries, cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and Fraud Law
Traps like those of Alonso and Ramos in front of the Ajax show ingenuity but not willingness to escape a penalty.
The alleged expulsion by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game played on November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink rivers to be written about whether such behavior is anti-sportive and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by the UEF.
As is well known, after a few minutes to finish the game (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time to draw laps to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will already end up as the leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory penalty in the next match of the league, against Auxerre, and will be able to pass cards clear to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned team coach José Mourinho with two matches, and with different economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that has arisen in the reported case is due to the fact that it has been starred by a team of the Real Madrid entity (who in his hymn presumes of nobility and honor, and who in the past has fined his players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, apparently by Mourinho, who added a technical story of his own.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions commit fraud; for in fact, they are actions respectful of the sport regulation, but they seem to evade its meaning.
The question lies in examining the type of damage to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets of the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not put in danger, i.e. there was no violent play.
Another of these assets that is referred to with the clean play is to prevent the team of the offending players from unjustly taking advantage of the opposing team, which did not happen either.
Now, the paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it did not fit what we normally characterize as a trap or fraud, because its violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but precisely its action tried to be the most obvious in order to receive the penalty from the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage do offenders get in the deliberate faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that it is not placed in a disadvantage to the rival nor is profit obtained in the same game, since obviously the result of the action involves leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it’s also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, since the team can be eliminated at the first change, and with this action players meet a penalty match and move to the second card cycle, in which the card accumulation suspension occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, to go through rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the sporting spirit, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that promote to make the most of what the rules allow.
In the assumption that we occupy, the players did not act to evade the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without taking the punishment or escaping it.
Although the border between ingenuity and law fraud is widespread, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and the way in which the transmission of the direction to provoke them was carried out.
The damage caused to the beginnings of the sport by these actions is not so ethical as aesthetic.
Offer Offensive to Capture Group Christmas Dinners at BCN
The calendar dictatorship this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th days.
They proliferate self-sufficient celebrations by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the turrón and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen ball for the restoration and recreation of Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have led to an offensive of prices adjusted and all of them between 20 euros and the majority of the customers.
To end complicating accounting, this year’s calendar (at the fall of Friday evening) has concentrated the requests on the week of December 13, with the result up to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16th and 17th) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has already been happening since 2008, when the stage of slim cows began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners on a budget issue.
In order not to overlook the tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, some and others demand battle prices, confirms the chairman of the Restoration Gremium of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer, to this day, does not dare to preach how the celebrations of this month will be.
“People think about it long before they book.”
“He wants to leave but has the alerts on the price issue,” he points out.
The business will go well “to those who give quality at good price and with good service,” he adds, and recalls that customers tend to take a step down with the crisis, so the strip around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
A survey at several central establishments found the collapse of requests for the night of 17th.
In the group Soteras indicate that there is an authentic boom of applications for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the conjunction, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more pre-booking, even since early November.
"We have done everything we can to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes ranging from 19.95 to 30 euros," they explain.
At AN Grup, which flags El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locals, remain optimistic after detecting a boom in turnover since the second half and some good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group point out that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends celebrating the holidays.
Their six group menus have added one Christmas, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a willingness to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green outbursts in some companies that re-invite their employees and feel that the volume of groups is somewhat higher.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Association), its vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts to start seeing the end of the tunnel and maintains that, as a whole, the reservations are "animated", although customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That is, the illusion for the holidays has not gone down, pay who pays, indicates.
Pakistan’s nuclear program generates great concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons “at a faster pace than any other country.”
Wikileaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program causes in Washington.
Aside from the clarifying and juicy details that offer on the contents of the talks and thoughts of US diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the matter of atomic security, rather than going on in the rising world, "decreases", and that the instability of any more nuclear country "produces nuclear weapons".
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program – that weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to make it difficult for them to be destroyed in the event of an attack – is one of the main reasons for the development in Washington.
This is what the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report prior to the visit of then National Security Adviser James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumoured dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of transportation of materials to chemicals.”
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is contemplated, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferating and reason to keep the watch.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs," said Yuri Korolev, a state expert, from the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The latest in Julian Assange’s filtered documentation is the ever-increasing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and Pakistan’s high pace of nuclear weapons production.
An office at the embassy in May, which described communication with Pakistan as "frustrant", said: "Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers are left unanswered or discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a South Asian National Intelligence official, noted that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by Army chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it “very clear” to the person responsible that “the Pakistani Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups.”
Hunting the head of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a senior anti-terrorist fighter to avoid further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to track the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be sure of the facts.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a “red alert” to “locate and follow the movements” of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
It’s not new, but it’s November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leakage of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents, but with the sexual abuse allegations the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks founder’s lawyer, Mark Stephens, says that “the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
It was day 20 when the international police body based in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but did not disclose it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, Interpol’s 188 countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange “in view of his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, do consider the so-called free-way notice network to proceed to a arrest -- which must include the national police force --, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden, and Sweden.
The movement has angered Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder has shown himself willing to answer questions by videoconferencing from the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the head of security of Stalin.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal pursuit," the missive denounced.
As the world seeks him – and from Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange remains in an unknown but not silent parade.
On Monday, she gave an interview to the director of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which she called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the UN violating international treaties that the U.S. has signed, he should resign,” he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request " ridiculous and absurd".
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorist fighter, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to remain important to Assange contrasts with opinions that today proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house from January, has asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations “to intervene and their funds and chase anyone from any contribution or assistance.”
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has had to retract after saying Assange should be “killed.”
“Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something.”
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, a former Arkansas governor, and a possible presidential candidate.
“Anyone in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be a too kind punishment,” Fox said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with guinea pigtails to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party to hold a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe for the sixth internal uprising in the ranks of ERC, without the north by the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his resignation hiding is insufficient for the kinsmen of the ex-leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can at all cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to win the new critics with guinea piglets that allow him to defend himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national advisers of ERC will be able to speak on their continuity in secret.
With papers, and not by hand.
If the carodists want to carry a certain sentence to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the leader wants to avoid the image of division as much as the image of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said that he would not be considered ratified with half the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that it would also not be a good result "to the Bulgarian".
Those close to Carod demand the president something more than to make his charge available to the militia, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But not having the majority enough to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap from here to May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to a vote by the national council on 18th.
Its intention is to applaud Puigcercós in exchange for this promise to advance the congress in the autumn of 2011, something that the dome already gives in fact.
The ERC leader acknowledged that “polyphony” is detrimental to stability and that its goal is to make the organization able, once and for all, to wash the dirty trays of doors inwards.
In this line, it is symptomatic the article that the acting counsel Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the head of Innovation said by fact that the leader will be reprimanded "in exchange for various objectives".
And he enumerated five of them, of whom two stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militia, i.e. to include new faces coming from the affinity sector to Carod.
The second may be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that the ERC immediately liquidates assemblyism as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be held through elected delegates by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 Conclave Convulsive left the commission to review assemblyism at a specific congress of statute reform.
This appointment remains pending, as the internal tide of recent years discouraged addressing the issue.
Now, without critical sectors at stake, it can be a good time to take it back and try to close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the count of MILENIO State of Mexico, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the state of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to the MILENIO State of Mexico.
Among the killings are three women and the discovery of a pair of corpses in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, there are 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases is the body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and a grace shot in the head as well as the feet and hands tied with cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the cage of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas street, in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the municipality of Naucalpan.

In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Golondrina Beach colony.
Emergency bodies conducted a thorough search of the other members of the body, however they were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán warned about the finding of a corpse found in the Peña Colorada scene, which was tied with his hands back and with his head sold.
The man had a wound caused by a gunshot in his neck.
In the middle of the month, two men were reportedly executed, who were wrapped in cobies and abandoned in the cage of a vehicle in the streets of the division Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, along with the victims were also discovered two death warning messages.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, two women were found dead in the village of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a yellow and blue baby, allegedly identified with the name of Mario Ríos, was found dead in the village of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning was located the body of a man in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a yellow baby with blue, allegedly identified by the name Mario Rios.

In the woman's skin were detected Santa Death tattoos, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the last part of the month, the body of a man in the municipality of Zinacantepec was found aboard a car with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a pair of men with their heads wrapped and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization saying, "This happens to those who don't align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tied to feet and hands, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agustín Colony Justice Center.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them was decapitated in the Ancon Knife colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon tape and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Next to him, the officers found a postcard with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The country’s representative at the COP16 said its country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and detailed that it supports its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45% by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45% by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, in the past four years, his country has invested <0x24>245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community on this issue.
He pointed out that China's climate change strategy is divided into four sections: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
All of these headings have made progress, including the adoption, last year, of a new Energy Act, which sets out the targets for reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with state and local authorities, to achieve the energy savings, energy efficient use and emissions reduction goals.
In addition, he said, several multi-annual plans are underway or have already been completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficient Use Program, which was implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for the change of fireplaces by savers and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s government’s scientific advisor on climate change, said China’s efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, he stated, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent over the last five years and plans to do another one both by 2020, it added.
Attached to legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the former panista leader is in his right to attend the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, said that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was tied to legality and that the former panista leader is in his right to attend the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo’s take-off as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to attend, where appropriate, through a complaint to the Order Commission of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body," he said.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that there was never at the negotiating table an alliance for the presidential nomination.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that National Action will emerge reinforced from the internal elections on 4 and 5 December, in which it will have to choose its successor.
“That (a 2012 alliance) is a topic that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was a local election approach that was successful and fulfilled the goal,” he said.
The panista leader said that the PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; to the counter "we enjoy and strengthen it," he added.
He said the council will undoubtedly know how to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, hence he will hand over the stack "to whom the council determines."
“I have that absolute tranquility and openness, to any of the five would be proud to hand over the office of the party president.”
He predicted that the rebound that the party recorded in the previous July 4 elections will be reflected in the upcoming contests, although "it's not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now, it's about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emitted from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be grounds for observation across the country, hence "many hopes, longings are laid on them, and I am sure that Gabino will be in line with expectations."
Asked about the criticism of the PRI to President Felipe Calderón for his speech during the four years of his government, Cesar Nava called on the Priscists to reflect on the sexenies of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; that they start defending them; that they come out of the closet,” he said.
He felt that the head of the Federal Executive could make expressions like those he did in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there is no bite or much less censorship in the country.
Obama promotes law on Twitter in favor of undocumented students
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass it is legislation,” the president tweeted.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass it is legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps an open cyber link with a broader document asking the public to communicate immediately with senators, as the vote on legislation is imminent.
“With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,” he said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block voting on any legislation, unless Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax case before the end of the year..."
“I think we can reach an agreement at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate majority Democrat Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would call for a "closing vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or American Dream Law would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the past five years and entered a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the contest of a handful of Republicans, at times when supporters of the project play an intense role in ensuring law enforcement.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
For this reason, supporters of the Dream Act require adding several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most cute Republicans are Maine senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Florida outgoing senator George Lemieux, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but have said they won’t back it at another time.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put the finger in the wound
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where participants made the narrative gala
"The sex in the language I understand but... the finger in the wound? what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, invited to open the second round of The Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of her question, she repeated herself in the other fairy.
The finger in the wound... "puts us in aprietos", the Argentine writer gently looked at the audience, mostly young people, who gave a quote at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramiro y Monteróris participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great tale, with Luisa in first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "league" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not get answers even if there are clues in the same narrative thread.
The infectologist is convinced: “Patience is not my strength, maybe it is my wound.”
In the end, after a frustrated approach to the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the hallway, but who makes it clear that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist whispered relieved and concluded "of the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue should go very well.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delightful narrative titled "Elogio de la Invención", where the finger in the wound is not named but at one point it is discovered.
With brushes of magical realism, he told a famous witch, who touched the same cloud, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a maid had lost, narration that he turned to talk about then America, the great novel that he did not miss with his ex-husbands and told his own stories.
“Cervants who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the pretended witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise they would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination that was lacking to the point of smell.”
However, he pointed out “it is the mad and the crazed who best imagine” and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that the narrated belongs to one side or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
It's actually called the "Cervantine tradition."
“By his inheritance we are what is counted.”
In turn, writer Mayra Montero hailed and applauded the variety of interpretations that resulted in the FIL’s invitation with her round table The finger on the wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed hers towards the great wound of social violence that traverses her country – and shares Latin America – product of the disputes of drug trafficking and sales.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs enclose a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between authors and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger on the wound of the writer committed to the writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in the intellectual habits and control of consciences that revolves around dogmatism, forgetting “that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes.”
“To be the owners of our thought and to be the owners of reality we have to nuance: and nuance means many times to put the finger in the wound and annoy those people who are much more comfortable thinking about cartoon, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance, and also to disturb the powers that prefer to write a world in black and white.”
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in the finals, has had highs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who encounter each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had highs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although so far he has gone blank and that’s why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up consoled with the medal of the under-champion, has left one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist came to his first final as a coach in the 2002 Open Tournament, when he wore the reins of the Morelia with which he fell for a total of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closure he also came to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total of 3-1 and was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a reversal again, as his team ended up scoring 2-2 against the choristers after 210 minutes of play, but in the tanda de penaltis he was put in advantage by 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title3 and finally his 11-game finals.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his turn-based rival, so he does not want to run the same luck, seeks to get rid of the curse and be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he claims that for him the most important is the institution.
“I want to be a champion, I don’t want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for an affiliation to which I owe myself and consequently the title will come to me, but the above is the most important thing,” he said when he was questioned about the numbers he has against playing in the finals.
"The only lesson we can have is that until the referee strikes the end we can't celebrate, we're ready on the ribbon, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties for throwing we were already ready to go out running and I think that's not the end of the game.
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalty shootouts, something that does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to get to the penalty shootout, one seeks to end in regular time, but sometimes there is no other but we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared for that, we were not, unfortunately we were in a bad game, made by the game.
Romano has in his hands to stop being a sub-champion and to try for the first time the glory given by the titles.
EU changes rules to obtain visas
Individuals must visit the Visa Applicants Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and the waiting time will be lower.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicants Service Centres (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant’s biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer will it be necessary to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and more so that the courier service delivers the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of <0x24>140 for a tourist visa, <0x24>150 for case-by-case visas (including visas for temporary workers) and <0x24>390 for trader and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken from the ASC, applicants requiring a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in the ASC less time than in the past.
Similarly, those applying for visas at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the additional service fee of <0x24>26.

NASA to Announce Extraterrestrial Life Discovery
The U.S. space agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Administration for Aeronautics and Space (NASA) will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life exists.
The finding will be presented at a press conference Thursday at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it would present “a finding that will impact the search for extraterrestrial life,” sparking speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures like us and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and they would put on the table the possibility that they would become as intelligent as humans if they improved the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way of survival and this ability increases the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that “yes, there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from the one we know.”
The space agency will announce the true scope of the findings at Thursday's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn’s largest moon), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern 'block' opposition
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it leads to the arrival of 'bipartidism', they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the MPs of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and all four questioned one thing: the arrival of ‘bipartidism’ in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'throned' against the reform to the Organic Law, since they were excluded.
With this reform, they reiterated, the beginning of ‘bipartidism’, because now there will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the panista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his character as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that with these reforms institutionally constitutes the political marginality on the part of the PRI and PAN.
He detailed that in the coming days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be again overwhelmed by both parties and thus the opposition coalition ended.
“So far it has come (the opposition coalition), that’s what I look at, because we are excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress after having been monopoly, now be "duopolitical".
“It is not the spirit to reform the law that there is eternal bipathism in Congress.”
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and are talking with other peers and peers to make them more.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from the PT, explained that today Congress has become a 'botin' between two, in allusion to PAN and PRI.
“It used to be just one game, now they’re splitting it between two.”
Patron Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to be given his place at the negotiating tables.
“Not by cupular agreements, leave out to 5 that we are probably going to make 9 deputies, save the five who see us, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unify to find a seat at the negotiating table, that’s the issue that in the reform they made they agreed, we are out and we are not in agreement with that reform.”
<0x24>200,000 extra for “the supplier”
Pay Mazatlán City Hall another cheque to the inquired owner of electric material company.
A cheque for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in the second half to the owner of the electrical material company, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the Municipality’s transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200,000 144.56 pesos, under the concept of “account settlement to be paid”.
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Auditor for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still indebted to him and, therefore, how many more checks are missing for being issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been bought, it’s simply being paid what it owes, like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, October 15, October 19, October 29 and November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Law marks when a company is questioned by ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using their services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used their services again.
The above, after 25 July, Noroeste published a review to the checks issued by the City Hall to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid more than 10 million cheques by the Municipality.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgent to visit tourist attractions
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Gloriata Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reverse how bad tourists find new activities or routes.
He said the bad state of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and take it back to nearby businesses.
“Politicals don’t know what it’s like to close a business one day and have no idea what money is being lost, or else they wouldn’t do the works in such a long time and without proper planning.”
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist’s fall exposed the City Council’s lack of prevention and maintenance.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so by giving preventive maintenance and not falling only into the corrective," he said.
“We are looking forward to enjoying a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be given maintenance, but as residents we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well.”
There are other sites that also look neglected and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and the Venadit of Mazatlan.
“Today, in order for tourists to come, it does not depend solely on promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what tourist attractions are,” he said.
“There has not been enough attention and this kind of facts highlights something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is needed.”
Raúl Llera Martínez, Deputy Secretary of Tourism Promotion, expressed that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, as they are not properly exploited and project a bad image.
He talked about a number of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to keep the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that you will have to order first, clean and put us online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote to the destination.
Request IP Results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that the MEPs take on the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A Legislature of work worthy and free of agreements between parties and the state executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsive Sinaloa that faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60 legislature, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergencia and one more of the PVEM, has been installed, which adds a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to perform a clean and committed management with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanism or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that the newly-established 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
“We hope that the MPs will actually exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary for them to make arrangements to guard their own interests and become carnival comparses of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
Hence he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that will lead the Governor in turn.
“We are busy doing a decent job and above all committed to society and the sectors because it was the signaloes who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of the state’s economic growth, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will somehow encourage the creation of jobs.”
As for the tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight that he revises within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
“I understand that it is the second secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruent as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and that it directly competes with the agrarian industry.”
In addition, it is required to label resources for detonating tourism projects that help in providing state security and in updating to the Alcohols Act that have not been able to be resolved in previous legislatures.
Looking for a Wizard King
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For your parents, the next Day of Kings will be difficult to please your illusions, as your home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a squirrel.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so much want.
The family lives in a humble house in the Colonia Salvador Allende and live on a daily basis because the father does not have a fixed job.
"So sometimes we see it hard because my husband doesn't have champa, but we sell mandarin and papa... already in the afternoon I go out with the plebes to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bike, while her sister Isabel, 3, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10, long aspires to have a ‘monster’ cart and for his sister-in-law Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothing size for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like this monster,' but I told him 'Let's see son,' 'because it was very expensive,'" Cayetana recalled with sadness.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, is size 12; Isaiah, 10, is size 10, while Miguel, 8, uses size 8.
José Juan, 14, is missing tennis, so a pair of five and a half or six would be of great help.
If you want to help realise the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the Search for a Magician King campaign, donating a toy or cash at the Northwest reception.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been carried out as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various charges.
Persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
“Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment for production have been seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke Courthouse in the hours following their detention.
They could face allegations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out the arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Approximately 70 agents from the Quebec Security Estrie Investigation Module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
You will be able to fight illegal migration without problems.
The conservative bill, which the government says should solve the problem of the sledges loaded with clandestine migrants, will certainly face a major opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I'm mostly based on the charter."
“I’m meeting here with a party that has created the granite you’re pissing on,” said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the caucus’ weekly meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone to be detained for up to a year from a ship identified as the transport of illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not back the bill because it targets the wrong target.
“We’re against and all opposition parties seem to be against the project, so we’ll see what the government is doing,” Duceppe said.
The NPD’s immigration critic Olivia Chow has turned down the criticism that her party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
"Neo-Democrats agree that measures are taken against those in charge of clandestine patters and that's what we're looking for with another bill, C-35," Chow said.
“We don’t support the conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties of playing politicians and omitting the will of Canadians.
“The vast majority of Canadians say to MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada, and that they treat the country as if it were a scam.”
“They expect Canada to take firm action,” Minister Kenney said.
The Government has not announced a confidence vote on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the government was going to request the holding of a vote so that every MP who is going to oppose would later be explained to their voters.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation is a matter since January last year.
The metropolis has a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
As a result, Tuesday’s announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It should be noted that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services in Quebec held on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for Quebec party critic Stéphane Bergeron to call the announcement "a rabbit pulled out of the scaffold" and "a last-minute whistleblower solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on possible future unity.
“You’ll see the results when we announce it,” it simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
“The more Mr. Charest insists on avoiding the creation of this commission of investigation, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide,” he explains.
“The only way to have an investigative commission is with the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this deadline, he suggests that Quebec grant a special mandate to the general intervener to conduct a collusion and corruption survey.
“We must be able to extend the mandate of the General Interventor,” he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the intervener the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent quadrillage is not the only project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to come from the Marteau prosecutor’s office, who has informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this issue.
131 people were arrested during the Spring 2001 operation related to motorcycle groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted.
Subsequently, Ottawa pushed for the adoption of the Gangster Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several watercourses are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a precautionary measure, the houses have been evacuated.
At night, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimetres of rain.
Also, additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations are added to the snow clearance that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that various rivers would overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan Rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and of the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rains have caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a precautionary measure, 10 homes have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has resulted in the closure of several routes, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civil security unit remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, according to Annik Bouchard, the security adviser.
The Quebec Growing Forecast Center, for its part, issued announcements Wednesday communicating strong growths from several rivers, including the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Wolf.
Dupont was partially blamed.
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain reversal before the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance and about Haitians, as well as for their gross language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, an improperly negative representation of Haitians and gross language that should not be used in broadcasts throughout the day".
The Council also noted that the debates on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two people who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made on broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after a complaint from the Common Front of people receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters must communicate reliable and not misleading data.
In connection with suicide, Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in "Dupont le midi" have dealt with a delicate issue fairly and appropriately."
Therefore, any fault has been dismissed in this regard.
The last dispute was about the statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred in a media confrontation that had sparked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help the Haitians because he could not know for sure whether the needy were really going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already completed my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issue of gross language.
In any case, the radio station CHOI-FM has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, who shall, inter alia, announce the decisions once in the hours of the larger hearing within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Algerian watchmaker Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar tour.
The athlete, who stands out in "sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing, climbs the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria,” said Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
“In my case, I’m looking for fights everywhere because, for those who don’t enjoy playing on the ground that involves mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America.”
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of UPS, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the Amateur World Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from October 23 to 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won in the full contact kickboxing and thai boxing categories," he said.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China".
"They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto".
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth".
"In 2007, in China, I finished fifth in the tournament, but reached third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
“The interesting thing is that I have progressed in every competition.”
“At this stage, I’ll be the first this time or next year!”
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline native to China in which you are allowed to hit with your fist and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
The clashes were originally held on a platform and, less often, on a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only keep a competition in his career, he will no doubt attend the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the Kung Fu Super Bowl.
“This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China,” explains the nice boy.
"It's like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
“It was an incredible experience.”
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
“What has earned me is a real professional,” he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals face in the final of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth <0x24>450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than a hundred contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, the project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec’s decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important <0x24>5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the consortium Énergie gerance obtained the lucrative contract without prior public tendering.
For the Quebec Party, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause price increases.
“This is a new method of collision and eliminating competition.”
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly," Quebec Party deputy Sylvain Simard said yesterday at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the question in the National Assembly because he said he did not understand how to benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, denying that a collision with this contract had occurred.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted "unhonestly" and "with a lack of rigor".
He said the “minimum” would be for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
Typically, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
Works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In all cases, the contract has been awarded without the competition coming into play; it has been a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the consortium formula in the technical advice sector is undergoing a government investigation.
A quick look at Quebec’s trade register allows you to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA<0x2B>, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, namely Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Gérance Consortium, Minister Normandeau has highlighted that "the James Bay territory responds to a particular labor dynamic and Hydro-Québec specifically responds to it since the 1970s".
The great project manager of Eastmain, Réal Laporte, of the Société d’énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
“If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices will be higher.”
“You have two options: you can get in touch with the players in the industry and tell them: we’re going to negotiate a satisfactory deal at a good price.”
“However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of people,” Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the consortium Énergie gerance is part of a long list of more than <0x24>50,000 contracts obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir identified 109 technical advice contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has 22 contracts, Genivar has 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts were negotiated.
A total of <0x24>449,783,344, including the Energy Management Contract of <0x24>295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has made it clear that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well-known of the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has let down the fact that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance it", before specifying that it is more about its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The "green" label does not inspire trust
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The consumer in Quebec barely trusts the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trademarks or ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Responsible Consumption Barometer, the first results of which were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. Consumers are immersed in a media universe where they push messages that advocate a more responsible consumption, but regret the lack of reliable information and consider that it even slows down their commitment.
Even if the consumption of so-called "socially responsible" products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
In fact, two-thirds of them say they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or their environmental advertising, the measurement tool developed by the Sherbrooke University’s Responsible Consumption Observatory reveals.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates bearing products called fair, as well as the credibility of products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "ecorresponsible", the Barometer notes.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take the speeches of politicians on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumer sector, which is currently supported by about a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the dubious nature of the information cause 46% of consumers to discard this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers say they also distrust the alleged yields of organic products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their beliefs.
61% have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood stores and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, the Barometer says.
More green and responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points over a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to occupy the position of the recycling king who tries to reduce its environmental impact by worrying about wildlife protection.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness seems to be of doors outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared cars to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavior survey, which has just completed its first edition, supports the use of bicycles and walking.
A loan for the state to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, to whom it has been asked to commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex after the Société Angus and Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Development Society Angus and Parallèle, who were expecting a <0x24>7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to re-purchase Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematic complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and return his true cinematic vocation, have not got what they were asking for.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would in fact be lower than the initial expectations; this could constitute a viable solution under favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and an application of 12.8 million last spring, but since then the applications have been revised downwards.
The president of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, forwarded a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent him a last report about a decade ago.
However, the SODEC received a counterproposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
Parallèle and Angus have a deadline until 31 December to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a state donation must be completely discarded.
Recall that the Association of Owners of Cinemas and Film Complexes of Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not fund real estate projects, as it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector have called for considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has been carrying the author’s cinema to its premises for ten years after financing its own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had known to be loyal to his client.
Angus and Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are driving a private funding campaign, hoping to raise <0x24>700,000 to pave the way for the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, has been projecting films on eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms next February 27, projecting Xavier Beauvois’ precious film “Des hommes et des dieux”.
However, Christian Yaccarini has not re-contacted Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downside proposals they have received.
The veil of complete Canada is lifted...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks unveil what the U.S. considers the Canadians’ complex to Americans, but at the same time reflect the U.S.’s sense of superiority towards Canada.
American diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don’t think about Canada-US relations when they’re going to vote and believe President Obama’s visit has helped the conservative government get his budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday, offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A September 22, 2008 cable, i.e., during the full federal election campaign, reports to what extent the United States does not enter into the issues debated by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins gives some explanations about this situation.
“Maybe political leaders are conditioned by a complex of virtually inherent inferiority to Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 Free Trade Campaign),” he writes.
He concludes, therefore, that the United States is “the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it.”
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this "stirring silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more so, of a party leader to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting."
This feeling of importance can also be observed the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Ottawa's businessman, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the government’s survival during the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will record a deficit for the first time in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between <0x24>30 billion and <0x24>40 billion,” Breese writes.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent the coalition from being replaced or that opposition parties conditioned their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington about the increasingly negative image transmitted by the dramatic series broadcast on the US CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence, and H2O, which makes unsubtle references to Maher Arar, the “No-Fly-List” or even the kidnappings for the CIA to carry out energetic interrogations.
Another cable says that during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that yes, but that he depended "on each case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote, “he has handed over a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.”
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the moods in relation to the WikiLeaks site have been warmed.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC radio that the man responsible for this mass flight should be “killed.”
In the United States, Mike Huckabee is echoed.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday, the UN in Cancún proposed a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) in an amount that corresponds to almost a third of the additional decline to be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major concrete projects that the UN hopes will be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding commitments to reduction in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluorescent bulbs or, better yet, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (LEDs or "LEDs" in English), much of the 1.8 billion Gigawatts (Gigawatts) in the planet would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary automotive fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 GT to 49 GT.
However, another 5 GT of that amount should be reduced to stabilize, by 2020, the rise of temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from being dismantled.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluorescent bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced even more than twice.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, allowing us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan applied in countries.
These new bulbs can also work with reostates and emit very little heat.
Above, they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have expressed their reservations regarding fluorescent lamps, as they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluorescent bulbs, but the coal thermal plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is depleted with incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report outlines the advantages this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save <0x24>1 billion a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it 2.5 billion.
Costa de Marfil looks forward to announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the “immediate” publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d’Ivoire, as the deadlines have expired.
“The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately,” a spokesman for the UN chief said.
“Ask all parties in Côte d’Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.”
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission has allowed the deadline to pass from Wednesday to midnight without the results being published, three days after Sunday's scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the president of the IEC had commented on television that the commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, the world's demands for the CEI to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo wing has the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former New Forces Rebellion (NF) since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N’Guessan, head of the president’s campaign in Côte d’Ivoire, said the UN’s voter intimidation maneuvers in the north of the country had dissuade the outgoing president’s followers from voting.
All elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepts Gbagbo's complaints.
However, Gbagbo’s opponents consider that the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has deemed the delay in publishing the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as claiming victory.
Its allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have put the crane on the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the political class in Côte d’Ivoire that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round on 31 October, with 38% of the votes versus 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment Rate Remains Stable in France in the Third Quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% in continental territory (9.7% taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected by the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of stops remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, with 9.3% of the mainland working population and 9.7% with DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but want to work, are or are not available within two weeks to work and seek or not work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate, with a new increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (<0x2B>0.9 points in three months, <0x2B>0.5 points in a year), 25% including the DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed under the ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in mainland France (<0x2B>0.2 points both in three months and in one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, a figure that rises to 6.6% with DOMs.
Unemployment stability among people aged 25 to 49 has only been recorded, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, <0x2B>0.1 points in a year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Insee has not published its monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical agency, continues to do so and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, misuse of funds and public property, cover-up, active corruption, trafficking in influences and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexander Guérini will fight and answer all the questions that the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
“It’s easy to chase him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to prove them,” his lawyer, Florence Rault, had told AFP before his client’s appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to be explained.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and imprisoned one of their relatives, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing his client has done has been to deal with the landfills he must manage.
As to the allocation of the contracts or the fate of the funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to the literary Simon.
Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, has been under investigation since Wednesday for misappropriation of funds and complicity, but has been released on condition and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have accused him."
“The instructor magistrate has taken into account the explanations and has left him free,” explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On the evening of Tuesday to Wednesday, four other people were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused of “traffic of influences and passive corruption”.
Two officials from Aubagne’s agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for “subtraction and misuse of public property by a person dedicated to public service” and for “complicity in misuse of public funds”, respectively.
Lastly, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “discovery of the abuse of social property”.
Among those who have faced Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies serve to whiten the capital of big banditry.
The investigation is under way in the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the research points out that the research focuses especially on the conditions of assignment and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Elisha exaggerated Syria’s mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French investigator detained in Iran for "spionage", has been holding the public in France, alerting to diplomacy and aggravating the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
It’s all under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elisha has explained its strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own crisis of “race” in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detainee in France and sought by U.S. justice for material trafficking for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the crude reality of how the French presidency attempted to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written in Paris on August 12, 2009, is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
Eliseo’s strategic affairs adviser, François Richier, accompanied by the Quai d’Orsay director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with U.S. diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
Explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own detained citizens into Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “slow continuously” in the media the words “fundamental human rights”, “innocence”, “immediate release”.
All to shame the Iranian regime, take care of its image.
“When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often.”
Because once the attempts to negotiate through discrete channels are exhausted, “silence will solve nothing,” the Iranians are “experts in dilatory maneuvers.”
Richier added that the detention of foreigners is "a common Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day he will take refuge in the French embassy) will “require the Iranians a large sum of money” (230,000 euros of reward).
In addition, he notes that Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss comes out of prison after 12 days, but is locked up in Iran.
The following information is being disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material into Iran, has been released in Paris by a decision of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, as well as numerous observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iran’s clandestine networks of procurement of material for the nuclear program, the expulsion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept an exchange?
Releasing the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier guarantees that this was not the case.
Elisha, he claims, has not only “been enormously surprised by the judge’s decision,” but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot cancel the decision," he said.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "strict" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
Eliseo’s adviser marks a phone number, hangs it, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian “is currently in a Paris building managed by the Iranian embassy.”
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysium does not shy away from efforts, uses communications and "flights" organized in the media to make it believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role as a "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity with some irony and check that manipulation brings its fruits, as several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the 'blitz' of the media of French officials".
What is such “gratitude” to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
“Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then discusses the reasons that have led Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The major communication effort “is aimed at validating Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he said.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, was just marked prematurely and unmerited."
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris tries to “show Syria the praises it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “seed the seed of the disagreement between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided: “Of course, we don’t know whether the Syrians have done anything or not.”
"But anyway, we've thanked him."
“At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Eliseo.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for playing an “active role in favor of the liberation of our country”.
From midnight, young Koreans can't play online
The South Korean government is going to pass a law called "Ashkent" that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight to young people under 16, according to representatives from the Ministry of Culture and Family.
“Many children play all night and then it’s hard for them to study at school and lead a normal life during the day.”
“We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, a ministerial official in charge of the bill.
The online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law.
The government also proposes to ask companies to limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of the youth so request, the head added.
In addition, it will make available to those who request it free computer programs that allow to limit the time of connection to the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly give news about various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world’s online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the organizer countries
Amid the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political election where influence struggles and lobbying can come to the fore on technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), following a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the interests of the world economy and politics.
Transactions between backgrounds, therefore, may last up to the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when it comes to voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the opportunities of his country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added wood to the fire on Monday when it broadcast a documentary that has highlighted three influential members of the CE, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to dislike FIFA and shame the English officials, who have launched an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the head.
The head of government hopes to re-edit the coup given successfully by his predecessor, Tony Blair, which had achieved in 2005 for London the organization of the 2012 JJ.O.O.
This intense activity, will it be enough to regain the brightness of England before the CE?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has numerous strong points thanks to their stadiums, ready, their experience (World 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the dark economic and financial outlook of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal the only thing they manage to do is give Russia points, which has become a weight outsider despite the gaps in its application (stadions, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct allusion to the allegations by the English press against the members of the EC.
“They’re pulling out their dirty traps, trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the 1994 experience, seems to be the most logical favorites.
World’s first economic powerhouse and headquarters of FIFA’s leading sponsors, the country seems to take advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new nominations appear premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the grant of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to be left without opportunities by 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue with its expansion to new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be affected by the weakening of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the test
De Gaulle really had doubts.
Mitterrand had made it clear that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less yet.
One mandate in Elisha leads to another.
The current head of state will be nominated again in 2012.
However, evidence of this does not match well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear to be doubted.
On one side and on the other.
In 2006, although they didn’t believe it, Jacques Chirac’s friends claimed that he would not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometimes in the fall of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with UMP deputies on Tuesday night in Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has provoked a certain riot.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited to two the number of five-year mandates.
He was simply transmitting the facts, not an announcement.
It's not the first time he's talking about presidential elections, with a funny tone, in meetings of this kind.
“In the worst case, or better, you’ll still be spending seven and a half years with me,” he said in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: “Don’t think I don’t raise what will come later.”
His affirmations do not bring him closer to the nomination, nor less.
There are comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the nomination in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has come to the lecture that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be sincere.
Rather on the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many people in the PS to demand that the battle be organized before the planned.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer François Fillon’s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy’s (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L’Express).
“We have a candidate and there is no discussion on the issue at the UMP,” the Prime Minister’s environment responded promptly and cautiously.
“If you think you can lose, you will not be a candidate,” says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its State Letters acquisitions
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow for clarification of the way out of the crisis or, at least, to announce the discontinuation of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that should end by the end of the year.
Due to the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuing institute will no doubt be able to afford to be so perennial if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation in the European bond markets today.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde backed the ECB’s active role in resolving the debt crisis of European states.
He did not want to say whether he considered that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its government bond purchase program.
"I reserve my opinion for my European colleagues."...
On the eve of his hearing at the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee in Brussels, President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear more eloquent in his intentions, indicating only that the programme for the purchase of State Letters in the secondary market "continued" and that we decided that during "we will see it."
The only thing that remains clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s acquisition of Treasury bonds doubled last week to around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.350 billion.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday he would have bought Irish and Portuguese securities again.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have acquired securities amounting to EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that the purchases will continue (see page 29).
Economists also do not anticipate any significant changes in direction.
Although lending operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on favourable terms and durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
"I can't imagine it's going to change your schedule considerably."
“If not, there would be a risk of new tensions in the short term,” says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
“It seems more likely that there will be a progressive outflow announced during the first quarter of 2011,” said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
With regard to interventions in the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of such bonds to keep the market stable,” adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuer has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
“It must compensate for the lack of investors in the market at any price and act in such a way as to prevent a marked increase in returns paid by the most fragile states,” a major bond manager said yesterday.
Because, if interest rates are put on by the clouds, States will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi overtakes the temporary
After Italy started the week in a worrying way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of bond rates to 10 years.
A recovery of precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "unencrypted" and that an "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements denied later by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with German long-term rates had reached the record number of 210 basic points and the price of bankruptcy-risk coverage contracts (CRQs) had fired up to 263 points, sparking a certain upheaval in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, expressed "deep concern" about "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland.
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, their problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the state to run the risk of not being able to cope with its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have meant a jar of cold water for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget that is being examined in the Senate is based on a figure of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (rather than 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the holidays, for an amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will need to be taken," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy has the support of international institutions.
“The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts are in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate problem, either in the short term or in the long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested by Italy are less than those required by other countries,” comments Pier Carlo Padoan, the chief economist of the OECD.
The problem of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion for censorship in the House of Representatives, after which elections could be anticipated by the end of March.
In such a case, an unfavorable period for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis would be opened.
Europeans reflect on strengthening the mechanisms to fight the crisis
Christine Lagarde said in a press conference in Paris: "I think we have already demonstrated on Sunday night and day that Europeans are clearly solidarized, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although it was relative, yesterday’s relaxation in the bond rates of European states has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a principle of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor’s announced it could lower Portugal’s debt rating, the most frequent target of speculation today.
“Like in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on the banking systems,” said Exane BNP Paribas economists.
Especially because “the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets.”
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying debates to strengthen existing out-of-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the Finance Ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also takes into account the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSI), its executive director, Klaus Regling, on Tuesday launched a tour in Singapore to inform investors in the Far East about the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first EFF securities is expected to be issued next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the U.S. would support a potential increase in mobilized funds through an additional IMF direct commitment.
With regard to the countries at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are added to the austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path than Greece and Ireland followed.
They both want to avoid asking for international assistance at all costs before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they deem necessary to build trust in a sustainable manner.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds are considering the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of public bond markets.
On the way through Paris, on November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to pull back the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, consider that an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
There is an instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently has 60 billion euros.
A advice that, without a doubt, could examine in detail the European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
Snowfalls continue to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are in orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to midnight and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Weather France, heavy snowfall affects the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on the Isle of France.
Snow layers between 2 and 5 cm, punctually between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Island of France and Lemosín.
Snows are strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, Météo France warns.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
According to the gendarmes, the circulation in the secondary network of Britain is complicated, so they recommend not to drive except in case of need and the circulation of certain TER vehicles has been prohibited during the day.
On Thursday, school transportation was banned in Picardia.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday night to limit the circulation of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture “urges all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation.”
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has called on airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Roissy airport in Paris on Thursday and 10% in Orly due to snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: First Financial Drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport on the Isle of France has reached its peak, it has rained billions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro that the Société du Grand Paris must build.
To start this SGP, the State has announced a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion allocation of funds.
Theoretically, this amount will be the one that will subsequently allow the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance a part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The Correctional Finance Act of 2010, reviewed at the National Assembly’s Finance Commission this morning, contains the devices foreseen to find the first part of that money.
There are two modes: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase of the office tax on the island of France.
The first, as we read in Article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in figures: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a modification of an existing office tax "to modernize it, increase its product and assign such increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
There are no figures in the text.
But it's far from 4 billion.
“It is necessary that the tax resources are added to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of the state’s funding that will be mobilized and allocated to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses,” the statement reads.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
“From the moment income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 billion later, as we explain.”
"It will be recorded in the budget and used according to the needs."
The SGP estimates that it will start receiving the <0x24>4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised <0x24>4 billion is not in the credit, can spark a slightly sparked parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on December 7.
Avenger hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks issue has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous to the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level and predicts a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press cuts.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi’s sinisterly ridiculous profile has long given ideas to cabaret artists to create their scammers.
The norm according to which secret records should only be made up of public-knowledge news is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosecruzes) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occultist texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for novelties about the non-existent), but because those dedicated to occultism not only rely on what they already know, which reaffirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
The same applies to secret records.
The informant is perezous, just as he is perezous (or has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I know, the editor of the Liberation), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. embassy sent from Rome to the State Department was the same as the Newsweek published the previous week.
So why have the revelations of these records caused such a riot?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultured person already knows, that is, that the embassies, at least since World War II and since the heads of state can call by phone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some limited exercises of representation, have become the center of attention.
Any spectator who sees research films knows it perfectly, just as we seem to not know it by hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the world’s most powerful country significantly affects the State Department’s prestige.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the “verdugos”.
But we enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell’s time, he could conceive at all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is proven, as it is now, that not even the crypts of the secrets of power can escape a hacker’s control, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the citizen’s avenger) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is in fact an empty, unsecreted secret.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, since it would be like publishing it on a street sign.
But it is also obvious that, with current technologies, it is not possible to expect to maintain confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a Head of State has travelled by plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and, therefore, novelistic, but I imagine government agents discreetly travelling in diligence with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, as much, hiding some data written in their pockets.
That information is then stored, in a single copy, in key-closed drawers: after all, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is now advancing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a wired (telephone) telegraph.
The video tapes (analogs) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, advancing and retreating, discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (digitals) only allow for chapter-to-chapter advancement or retreat, i.e. to huge proportions.
With the high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travels it brings, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques take us back to the horse carts.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was being secretly plotted in the embassies.
Currently, it is the embassies that request confidential information to the press.
Climate: France’s caps on its financing promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to consider whether the fast-locked (fast-start or early) financing promises made by developed countries have been met.
And the French hats have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide <0x24>30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.260 billion (i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million a year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparency was a remarkable result and was appreciated for what it really is worth: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right path to fulfilling its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be “new and additional” to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development assistance.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Nowadays, each one chooses the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission has taken the year 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained and 150 million are added in three years in terms of fast-start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with respect to the year or level of official development assistance.
France, on the other hand, considers the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to expenditure in previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, France’s total amount of aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) while it claims to respect its commitment in terms of “new and additional” funds.
Another crucial element is the distribution of donations and loans.
Once again, there is no norm and each one chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that each euro borrowed equals a donated euro.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to emission reduction based on more efficient technologies), it is false to present a euro that is going to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... As much, it should only be calculated for its commitments of a country (as much as a country should be said for the rate of the price).
But France does not find such a reasoning useful: it "respects" its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.5% of donations (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million); see the EU document to see it for itself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it in 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes a euro to fulfill its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
That's a good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France commits a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to shares in time and on the other, in relation to real financial effort.
Spending just <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, it manages to give the impression that it is spending 420 million "new and additional," as it had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has handled the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in negotiations, since developing countries are not stupid...
The chapter on early funding is a brief, relatively short-term, detail in relation to the whole of the climate negotiations.
But it could be a grain of sand more in the immense machinery that is CMNUCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its calculation method for 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the rest of the EU countries.
But, especially, France could make the debates on betting at stake in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter that is currently being debated): we will not get rid of the issue of "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive in relation to this issue as it is with others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast starts and its vision of “additional character” and the use of loans would help improve the level of international confidence needed to advance the negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old boy ingested 81 different chemicals on a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value given the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", acquired in Oise and Paris supermarkets between July and September the foods a child of about ten years consumed on four days and ten days.
These meals taken as a model, which comply with official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day), as well as treats, were examined in laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or likely carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Center for Research on Cancer.
“While, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is troubling,” the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogenic residues, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as an attempt for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan greens, including in food, where the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian fillet, canned tuna, and even bread bar or gum were tainted with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon roll was the most "nutrient" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk these "pollutant cocktails" generate for the consumer "is probably underestimated," the study says.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the rise of civilization-associated diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (AESA) indicated the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
