Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament, as part of an amendment to criminal law, rejected the draft annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymoshenko, the head of the opposition.
MEPs rejected in second reading the draft amendment aimed at reducing penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently incarcerated.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for concluding an a priori unfavourable deal with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not definitive and the court must decide on the appeal of the conviction in December.
Tymosenko called the regime's political revenge judgment and provoked a process of suspicions of partiality in the tribunal also in the west.
The draft annulment of paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 Members.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Victory of Libya
Libyan liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As is common in the region, the winners of the election are the Islamists, but they are either moderate or radical.
The Interim National Council has decreed the customary law of the Charia and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because a robbery cuts his hand.
Women can forget emancipation, the possible disrespectful ones of her faith are liable to capital punishment.
It is the Qur'an that will unite in place of the dictator's personality the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya there will be such an order as we cannot represent ourselves and as we would certainly not like.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best, and it would probably not be beneficial to the Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted help with recognition of unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the NATO strikes, but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated at every attack.
So when it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our policies turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militaryly occupy Libya.
Therefore, there is no problem for locals to get rid of the "cruzes".
Without land occupying, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much, and the West will eventually be able to boast of an uninterested protection of human rights.
We're barely being prevented by these Sharia followers.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are at the forefront of investors.
A tornado of statistics happened on Tuesday over Europe.
Each of the states published GDP information for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market breaks all records.
Investors look not only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistics offices in the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have earlier published their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, while France’s GDP is expected to grow by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the figures for the second quarter during which Germany was better than expected (increase of 0.3% rather than expected 0.1%), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (which was the cause of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Office of Czech Statistics it is confirmed that it is heading towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than the forecasts of the analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, according to forecast and periodically recalculated data.
The eurozone and European Union economy grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analysts expected.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Return on bonds over ten years is 28.45%
The yields of the bonds of Spain and Italy are rising to critical limits.
The problems are beginning to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Czech bond yields remain below 4% while the situation worsens in the region.
Voices are heard in Germany to say that the ECB should be the ultimate guarantee .
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The soccer team has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to super Cech and guard Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also defended with good luck in the second half of his qualification and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.co.uk followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second.
The Czech team also won thanks to super Cech and hero Petr Jiracek with 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification to the European Championship.
The Montenegrins were under pressure until the second part because of a precise Czech defense.
The match's vicissitudes were Damjanovic and Vucinic who lost two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, plus a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
Both teams were difficult to mount combinations and the game concentrated mainly around the center line.
The pressure of the national footballers failed to pierce the Czech defense that accurately responded to the long shots even during the first half of the season.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They have created a human shield.
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from Ispahan universities created a human shield around the Ispahan nuclear technology center where uranium is transformed.
They thus openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities is reported in Israel.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, which aims to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The feeding of an obese child: does not take breakfast step and takes charcuterie for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren weigh above average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families who have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the models that surround it is.
On the tables of obese children, for example, meat mills are found 50% more often than in families with children with normal weight.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner, according to the survey conducted with an awareness campaign "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of big kids, sports is also not a habit, which is now the case for most schoolchildren today - only 15% answered that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted during the last school year and 900 pupils from primary schools in the Czech Republic participated.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", an action supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever company.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third have enrolled in this project.
One of the decisive factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight, or even obese children, is the lack of proper nutrition and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children surveyed indicated for example eating breakfast 5 times a day - in case - lunch - tasting - dinner, which is a basic principle of good nutrition," one of the results of the survey said.
Without breakfast and charcuterie at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development it takes some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of students’ families eat at the same time.
In most families, each person has their own breakfast.
And the worst thing that has been noticed is that one-tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
However, breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families with obese children, unhealthy fries are consumed more often.
Almost every student – not to mention weight – drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of children surveyed do sports on a regular basis, but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food for yourself
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own diet from options proposed according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Among their favorite dishes are many cakes, meats and candy.
“The most alarming is a great preference for sweet lemonade,” the study’s findings said.
For lunch it is the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
The children did not want any fertilizers at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Cape on Health
The survey also showed that children are willing to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
"In the course of a control of a group of survey participants who had filled out the questionnaire after the awareness session, 'Obesity is not a coincidence', a well-determined willingness to head for a healthy diet was set," the results of the survey indicate.
The most notable was, for example, with respect to sugary lemonades as children began to prefer drinking water.
Children most often cooked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce sugary dishes and "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread balls or potatoes).
The stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article about how to learn for stylists, I got a little mad at the fact that there was a lot from the beginning.
I didn’t think about what would happen next.
Exhibitions by three professionals of the specialty, the characters' clothing and a seminar on what is happening on the spot.
And it'll be worse.
The more we approach the final exams and the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it's really "burned".
This time we discussed with Director Alenka (in the course there is no boy) how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this type are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without a particular curve, another of overweight.
The stylist needs to know how to optically amplify wide arms, extend a neck or add the necessary curves.
We have been able to highlight the character nicely and also not to dress too visibly with the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a thin size.
For example, if there is a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that the skirts or pants do not pass at all, it is worth making it custom.
And you will not regret it because the clothes that fall flawlessly are invaluable.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in the one that slips constantly, wraps and does not stick to the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a Tucker-style clothing, with sewn pieces of fabric, or even embroidery.
There are, of course, many examples of different appearances and I am happy that I have all week to sort out all the information I have received.
But I'm also afraid that in terms of what I have to do at home there's too much.
Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of fashion of the personality as well as its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know from the campaign the Secret of Victoria.
At the bottom of my mind, I’m happy because it’s better than dressing up Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost a hundred pounds lately (don’t take my statement, etc., completely seriously) or young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search on the internet, print and work on graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphics.
Thinking about the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses the physics but creates the productive pages in magazines (on products given the trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, has entertained us with all of this.
But this,... until Sunday
The stylist must have an overall vision
Three guests from the specialty gave a diverse look to the Saturday session filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with one garment differently.
Variability is essential for this example.
For example, this trench-coat that has to be worn in a classic way with a jean and a t-shirt as a light jacket but also can also dress the naked body, with scarves and take it as a dress.
Or just put your sleeves or neck back up and have a new look right away.
"Play with that," he stressed.
But I especially liked the advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then start to get it wrong," Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with, what to do with, why, when in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statements on fashion parades.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben, that the stylist must have much more variations of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is, for fashion story that will have about a dozen pages (so about a dozen templates) I have to be ready to "retail" at least a fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements look completely different than in reality.
We have to count on this during the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make up half of the success was confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylist services remains frivolous.
And familiar faces sometimes see them as useless (it’s enough that I know something but what I seem to pass in the second rank).
And if someone does make a styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he most likely dictates us a completely different (smaller) size than he actually has.
It is then left for us to navigate on google and make sure if the boulevard information indicates the celebrity in question, if it is lean or fat, etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday that it is not enough for the stylist to orient themselves in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He needs to communicate with the people he wears and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to guess people, not to flatter themselves, keep their opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort out his closet and fill it with new items you can't throw it all away and tell him, My God, what a horror."
“You’ll find some things that you’ll find beautiful and he’ll advise you on what to wear them,” says Mario.
This one has shown us concretely what all should contain what is called the "placovka"or the stylist's bag.
It’s the one you hang around the size and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, rollers for hair removal or groove pins, there is also a nylon yarn (which the stylist uses to photograph products like bags, or hats), special clips with which we are not able to close a dress in the back or because it's too large (if it's too large).
So that we were not only people who listened but who tried something practical they taught us how to resemble shoes correctly.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could deteriorate, at fortiori on the outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors so as not to injure ourselves inadvertently.
We really need skills, therefore.
Mario was pleased when he congratulated me on my creation.
The account I'm reporting isn't for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of the course
I’m starting to understand more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what they want.
The need for speed Le Run is disputed across the Americas.
Revision
Originally a problem-free race is transformed due to a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift to work.
It fills everyone’s ambition to some extent, but it serves nothing if no one wants to do anything else.
The new subtitled The Run produced high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed racing series and to come out some sort of game from playable games that would not count only with points.
So we were curious about how the added passages will be during which the main character gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already the case in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole is pulling down due to some unnecessary flaws that have already existed for several years.
These are not really errors but rather the expression of an incomprehensible fanaticism on the part of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are taken into the adventure whose main character Jack has character problems and to solve them starts participating in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The itinerary is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on a different route and the planned stages in different environments that are quite different from each other and are interesting.
The player does not have the feeling for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are pretty nice even though the graphical technical level is the same type as the previous series.
This is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in high snowy mountains is very visually pleasing.
The tests are further enhanced from time to time by an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to make sure that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Alongside this, the different races are well organized behind each other.
There's only a small number of them, but that's enough.
There are moments when you try to exceed the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the watch (the classic duel with the chronometer) and then again await another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police that enters the game and is trying to make you the situation difficult.
The new ones are the out-of-vehicle passages.
Rather, it’s an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs out in front of someone and you have to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
There's nothing complicated.
What’s surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be specific there are only three).
As a result, it is as well as this because this element is not likely to interfere and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that please the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that there is nothing extraordinary at the moment, but it cannot be said to be negative.
When it comes to realistic simulation, you’ll have to go somewhere else.
But although you can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not yet at the point.
We do not expect from this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not have, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, it is therefore not completely good.
During tight overlaps you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car part in crazy bumps.
Or maybe he's in the middle of a slippery slope.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really bothers you.
The restart is done in such a way that when you have broken the figure or you have come out in the decor the game takes you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
Once you have used the 5 restarts you must restart the game from the beginning.
So it’s more a tool, in case something doesn’t go right, that something you can really count on.
Sometimes restarts do not help and you need to find a solution by remembering the piece of the route in question.
The big hic of this game is that the same actions are in the same places.
For example, there are certain twists that you have to pass in a certain way otherwise this does not pass.
Otherwise you will meet in a given place "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute late.
What gets angry is the situations when you see the opponent easily pass between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either stand aside and turn them around or brake them.
It doesn’t matter if you go ahead of him because it’s “calculated” in such a way that for the given situation it always happens very close to your nose.
Adversaries have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you arrive in certain places, again without worrying about the weather, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This is most annoying at the end of the game when you’re riding on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must pass before you at all costs.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of the other vehicles in the opposite direction and you come into collision many times.
You can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adredaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have the time to follow everything that's going on.
And it doesn’t matter if it’s because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there’s no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea is to change cars during races.
You need to pay attention to the gasoline pumps on the routes as you can change car there however most of the time the one you have is enough for you.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cylinder cars for highways and super exotic sports cars on high-tech roads, for example on lace roads in the mountains.
And the challenge mode, which are races in particular places that you know about the adventure, goes very well with the main diet of history.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, various objects begin to unlock:
This connects online with the Autolog feature, which among other things compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other features in the community.
One of the hardest hits to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the metro tunnel (it looks like it) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks like it).
Your speed indicator indicates you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you comes a subway branch that sends you the car directly to the railroad.
At the time of writing we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought about when creating this game or whether the authors really take us for idiots.
The technical part of the game is not extra,but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is bothering is that in more extreme situations, the imaging does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This is especially true for accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imaging is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is at your choice.
In order to please as many as possible and especially the younger audience a new soundtrack has been created in the style of "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for the music.
Need for Speed: Le Run is really confusing.
If the game didn’t have these stupid errors, we could say without fear that it’s the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it is not finished.
The fun is really good but prepare yourself for the flaws to fall into your eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.
The Students of Velvets in concert with the Choirs of Charles University
The Festa Academica festival offers for the third time festivities that link the International Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical part.
During the festival there are 20 choirs from high schools and secondary classes.
The festival is composed of two concerts organised on November 17.
"Charles University plays an important role in this festival."
" Among the choirs is the Choir of the Faculty of Pedagogy and Humanities, in the festival committee is the rector Vaclav Hampl," says the head of the organising team Jakub Calou.
The highlight of the festival is the Choir of High Schools and Secondary Classes concert that takes place with free admission on 17 November from 2 p.m. on the premises located in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
In the program there is the composition of the well-known Czech jazzman Karel Ruzicka, Celebration Jazz mass.
In the evening the concert "Students of Velours" takes place in the premises of the National House in Vinohrady during which the choirs of higher schools as well as the choir of Charles University take place.
The objective of the Festa Academica is not only to celebrate International Students’ Day with dignity and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present to the public choir music of the highest level and to develop the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organizer is the Czech High School Union in cooperation with Jan Kepler High School.
All the action is under the auspices of Bohuslav Svoboda, Mayor of Prague and Vaclav Hampl, rector of Charles University.
The festival takes place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and in Pardubice.
The program also offers high-level concerts, mixed meetings, a student event and other activities.
Interested people will find all the information on the festival’s website www.festaacademica.cz.
Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
“I didn’t expect such a tough war.”
"It will take 5.6 years for the situation to calm down and all players to get used to their new role," said Miléna Vicenova, the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
When she succeeded in describing the various EU bodies and their relations in such an understandable and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers at the Faculty of Law at Charles University could enthusiasm her, she showed how she took her motto "understandable and open" about Europe.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
“From the beginning, the criticism was that he is fade, that he is a leather round, that he can’t fulfill any mission, and I have to say that he cut everyone’s breath because he keeps his role to perfection.”
“He is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe.”
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in the context of an answer to the question: "Who is in the European Union?" "What phone number should I call?", thus as an important step towards unity and a greater readability of the Union's policy.
No one wants to ban us our syrecky (cake pasta flavor that feels very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that the European Council has lived, will live and will live in a near future.
She called the Czech Presidency two years ago a success.
The Czechs solved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis, or organized a summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, "activity has beaten its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved even now.
In addition, it is necessary to approve the new EU septimal budget, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it would seem that the budget will be thin and in terms of savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, all that is to be resolved in future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an Understandable Europe".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted cornices, bananas differently large, or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky.”
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
In addition, she regrets seeing such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, she said, is the result of several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a low support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she subsequently stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
“Believe me, when the Polish, the Hungarian, the Slovak come to me, this Frenchman says to me, ‘Hey, what are you doing there, what is this group of Visegrad still doing?’”
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future there will be tough new fiscal policy rules for the Member States.
This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not a multi-speed Europe, which is preferable to a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the eurozone and others outside the zone."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
First of all, it was said that the countries that want it and those who don’t want it are cooperating with each other.”
"There will be a lot of institutes of this kind and there will be a really two-speed Europe," Vicenova said.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all issues that have an impact on the EU should be debated among all EU members and not just the euro area membes.
History of a brand:
IBM Innovator Starts the Second Century of Its Existence
If someone had to look for the vocabulary that expresses the most closely IBM strategy, the nearest would be “the long-term”.
For a broad audience, IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm feeling as very current and yet it has been a hundred years since its creation.
The basis of this long-term strategy was laid by the company’s first head, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved for little that people are willing to think.
Its slogan "Think!" became the footprint around which the life of a future giant will evolve (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
It was the basis of Watson’s nursing company culture.
For us, IBM means long-term thinking of continuous movements toward the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it remains true to its core values and yet has not been afraid to change everyone else around it.
This enabled us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more" said the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano for the anniversary.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, took care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM's people were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid holidays, an employer-paid insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system for them.
In the same way, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was at first brilliant in the discovery of talent—as one of the first firms to abolish any form of discrimination and thus have the choice.
The current plan is entirely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman- Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been working at IBM for thirty years and currently serves as Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been doing what is called jamy, brain-storming online from which many future strategies and innovations have emerged.
It is not surprising that it has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are almost 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures a secure position in the business field.
“From the beginning, IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a tech firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology,” added Geogre Colony of Forrester Research Consulting.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is familiarly called the United States given its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the world's largest firms.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the level of server products to nanotechnology.
She holds many patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of her employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are, for example, the ticket dealer, the payment card, the financial swap, the barcode or the diskette.
IBM found itself this year with <0x24>220 billion the second-largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
Not all innovations and manufactures have been preferred by the customer and at the time - for example, IBM failed to bet on a clean OS/2 operating system, the Prodige online service or the IBM PCjr computer:
“From the moment your business is built on moving forward you can’t emotionally hang on to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this reason, IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms and when they don’t work, it goes away.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft competitor that basically stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In IBM revenue, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a dominant place.
Still in 1990, however, she was with more than one of the strongest contributors of hardware.
As of the year 2000, IBM sold low-income assets for <0x24>15 billion, during which period it invested <0x24>58 billion in the purchase of forward-looking technologies.
It continues in investment and even from 2008, when it first surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM is negotiating according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased its investment volume.
Is it now apparent that IBM is going through the current crisis without worrying?
IBM’s stock price has increased by 120 percent since 2008, with the company’s net profit continuing to grow.
The IBM logo is to change everything but not its values.
For this reason, we can expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
IBM's story: From cheese slices to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it was originally called Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a subsidiary of a company in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was the merger of four companies whose history is linked to the 80s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointers", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 chaired the Company's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him lead the company.
The leader then shadowed the founder of the firm – it is on Watson’s ideas that until now rest on the identity and culture of society.
Watson ran the firm until 1952.
IBM, as its name implies, started with the production of all the machines possible for business and trade - from cheese and meat cutters to checkouts.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, sales increased to <0x24>9 million and began expanding the firm to all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable to the firm that after 40 years of leadership, it was his son who held the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM's humans and computers helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight to the Moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer factory to Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has succeeded in the last three years is the Smarter Planet concept “a smarter planet.”
Its objective is the intelligent updating of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
As far as the area of commerce is concerned, IBM recently developed a "Smarter Commerce" platform that helps traders manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in our territory as well.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team that deals with speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep this ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
It was just that she couldn’t wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in Bartosova in her home in the summer, she had no doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta insisted on moving from Ricany after 30 days, Pepa did not push the singer back.
And he confessed in public that he loved him.
In time Darina resigned, accepted her husband’s engagement and ended up saying goodbye to her forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome her on the door step of the house.
“He is my son’s biological father and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will put him out.”
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old ass, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," Rychtarova said, showing that she has separated from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door to her is not a problem for Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
“I’ll stay with Iveta and I won’t change.”
"My wife set up a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"Darina and I have a completely normal conversation, but we don't sleep together," Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he won't stop it.
“We don’t sleep together and I don’t care where she goes, with whom and if she has a connection.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility,” Joseph concluded.
Worst Victims of Women: Is This Affecting You?
If you ask men to determine the typical vices of women, all, like each other, are able to get them out of "their sleeve".
Dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of the female vices that come to pump the blood from the veins of men.
The Purchases
Does your partner make you feel that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one clothing per week?
Are you satisfied with the purchase and by package at the time of the balances?
In your case, we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should limit their passion for shopping.
But what would you say, which would stand in the windowsill of clothing stores, to look for beautiful clothes for themselves and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And while for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for men.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse that he was waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
“I need to lose at least 5 pounds – should I start doing sports?”
"Did you like it?"
Doesn't these phrases remind you of something?
Oh, yeah?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is still complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more frequent these complaints increase and the more women become toxic.
The smell and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite maneuver.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the floors, do dust, decapitate the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they sank the sink, crushed the living room glass, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be at the forefront of the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sape
"Put this used outfit in the garbage."
"Are you going to put those old socks on tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the ground."
If you do on your partner this messy work this way several times a day, you’re really going to break it down.
It’s obvious that you don’t think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew it, women wouldn't have to do so much of a job...
Defamation, Persiflage
Defamation, perspiration, but also insults against someone are also the property of some women.
Women are particularly attracted to relationships and thus are happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets escape a little harmless persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart, however, is a peculiarity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persevere, even despise others and are particularly dangerous for their surroundings – especially at work in a women’s collective.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the Philadelphia victory
Hockey striker Jagr participated twice in the Philadelphia victory during Monday's NHL game on Caroline's ice and is again at the forefront of the productive Czech players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another pass and was named the best player of the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the match.
Jagr after the match told reporters from overseas that he had warned Giroux that it would be a big night.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick."
"I heard it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," Jagr explained after his action Giroux scored a goal of the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later there was a second attack by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind Hurricane goals for the pallet and presented it to goalkeeper Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
“I’m not saying he’s the best player in the league but he’s really one of the top three,” Jagr said.
“I never thought I’d end up playing with a hockey player like him.”
“I’m really happy with that.”
“I want to play on him.”
"All these years in the NHL the other players in the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr said.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again of Dwyer on a penalty shootout she ends up with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended at two against one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He taped on the pallet, I took the speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the last goal of the game from his point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he came in second-third due to an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not hold against an experienced defender their advance of two goalsets lost after a penalty shootout by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
It is the fact that the back line was sick that mostly bothered the local coach rather than losing points as they played the match only with 5 defenders.
"It's zero."
“We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young people.
“But there’s nothing to do, it’s like that,” says Jacques Martin.
“Replacement on replacement was not enough and we couldn’t resist.”
"We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area."
For this we had limits," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender involved in the thirtieth Winnipeg attack and victory over Tampuu Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, which stopped a series of 5 games lost.
How Travel Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel especially in the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled for holidays in Eastern Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a slope for the west and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the socialist countries.
In case the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter otherwise the individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered travel to the West, however, it was necessary to do the queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that, it wasn’t won yet.
The deal for currencies that was the condition for travelling to the west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the currency agreement (western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were consequently many country houses and cottages that the Czechs used to haunt and this habit lasts until now.
The Czechs’ journeys have been a major revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at their maximum, the Czechs spent 4 million days abroad last year in countries around the world.
The great paradox of which we are not aware today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in the western neighbouring countries has led to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not travel for a long time by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a trip to the Czechs was at that time to bring with them their own canned food, sausages, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the exchangeability of the Czech crown which allowed our tourists finally after decades of being able to freely buy the Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average salary have increased, which caused another important moment around 1997.
With increasing demand for travel, travel agencies have started to prepare tours with air charter connections since 1997, which through contracts have dramatically reduced costs compared to previous ones.
At the end of the 90s, the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world except the EUs that later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, was prepared from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the EU removed visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to become fully within the group of developed countries.
Also in 2008, Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person on holidays abroad including annexes.
The General Assembly must find its President but this could end up in a situation without a solution "one pat"
Almost 5 months ago, Czech football is without a President and there is a risk that Ivan Hasek's successor to the head of the Czech Football Association is not yet known after a general assembly to be held Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting procedure to proceed.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in Czech football management.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
It was only during the era after Hasek that football returned back to divergences between the Association's chambers that could not agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16, when a new president was to be elected.
Delegates from the General Assembly met uselessly at the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and there was not even a question of how to vote.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or also full-powered invested officials.
In this single point, there has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance of the Office of the State and the Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Discrepancies continue with regard to the regulation for the election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also brought nothing to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times but the neuralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third lap so as not to fall into the pat.
"The apple of discord lies in the following fact: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Czech Football Association Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model wins in the third round that of the candidates who have received the most percentage votes in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to be withdrawn so that the candidate who has received the highest percentage of votes from both chambers wins.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentage of votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of the previous two towers and it would completely reject the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the moral part and who would be best not to change the regulation and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees, even though he believes that the election settlement established under the Pelta Statute is the most advantage among all candidates.
"I wish that a maximum vote should be taken in accordance with the statutes of the association."
“For there are not yet any bad ideas imagined by a representative as during the past General Assembly,” said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations has defined himself primarily against Pelta.
The fear remains optimistic.
He said there will be a new President in Nymburk and believes that the candidates will cooperate together and constructively in the future.
"The qualifying for today's European Championship should calm everyone."
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation," added the Jablonec officer, who among the three has the greatest experience in football management both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
“I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense.”
“This is not a problem between the Czechs and Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the drawing regulations.”
"This could again cause a blockade to the General Assembly."
“I hope the healthy reason will win anyway,” Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement for all parties.
Some reunifications should take place directly in Montenegro but who can say whether the whole direction of football will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorica, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and was looking for a variant to take part of the Executive Committee on the ground of retaliation.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the broken parts within the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state dot, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclik goes to the fight for the position of President because he doesn't see any correct candidates.
If Plzen's head of football Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asks for a new President of the Czech Football Association (AFRT), he would not be campaigning for this high position.
“If such a candidate exists, I support him, I fight for him, and I don’t run for election.”
“But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate,” Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from accessing the head of the AFRT, which would be a priori favored for this election.
Paclik also points out that if he wins the election, he would only hold this post as President until 2013, the year foreseen for a General Assembly.
He would see well in the function an experienced and high-level manager who is not related to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he said.
“It was terrible for me when some people told me they didn’t want to be identified with Czech football right now.”
“I would like to change this image,” he added.
What is said to be especially awkward, Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man with a false reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates in the General Assembly.
It is unacceptable for Paclik that Pelta serves as President.
"If he wins, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying merchant, it would be even less favorable for football," Paclik said.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta’s name was pronounced a few years ago during a hearing in an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago, "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen."
In the event that Paclik wins the vote on Thursday, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been backed by Paclik before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go with."
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as the head of the representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he would not be able to."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September attracted great attention when he voted for the cancellation of the Arbitration Commission with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to lead private firms and has also been leading the Plzen club since last year, which with his support in May celebrated his first division triumph.
“I have the strength to change something in the world of sports and to bring a certain culture to it.”
“I would curb the influence of some interested groups who have a tendency to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, for example, which leads to situations of bad taste,” added Paclik, who does not seek his antipathy for Sparta leader Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also envisage a harmonisation of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power in high-level policies would allow for more money from the game tax for sport.
“This is one of the key issues that the new president should address.”
“When it comes to gambling tax as stated by political parties, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes,” he said.
Paclik doesn’t take his current link with Plzen as something negative even though he claims that the AFRT president should be “over the parties”.
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"That's not the ideal."
I don’t see any reason to pass on my shares from the Plzen club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later,” Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT that should put an end to pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidates Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future disputes over the electoral settlement.
Jablonec’s official is very optimistic before Thursday’s meeting in Nymburk and thinks that today’s successful soccer performance should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta before the September election, which did not take place, promised to devote itself precisely to national representation and to obtaining financial means if elected.
He decided to be a last-minute candidate just before the General Assembly passed and this two-month delay could well allow him to defend his vision of football leadership and present it in a broad context.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a president on Thursday.”
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the lead of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily associated with the club of Jablonec, has worked for many years at Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
It is also for this that he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly the statutes were approved which were not perfect as everyone has noticed."
“If there weren’t all these different interpretations, we would have had a president since September,” Pelta said.
It is precisely the most important revision of the Civic Association document that has taken all the attention of the delegates.
“If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and I am ready to take all responsibility in case it doesn’t work.”
“This is a principle without which we cannot exist,” Pelta added.
Then he tries, they say, not to confront his opponents.
He said earlier that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized in terms of his legal training and that he knew correctly that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He has also not attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, who on the contrary continues to criticize Pelta.
"It's been evolving in football for a year and has already had some success."
“His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign.”
"That's also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta told his opponent's address, but remains faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon, according to him, is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to the national team.
It's supposed to be a soccer vibe.
“And I would also endeavor to end all business that starts with Bohemian business or the aftermath of the corruption scandal.”
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sectors so that we can get enough money for the whole football," the 46th candidate told the Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his nomination to the head of football would not lead to any change of people.
"I should get acquainted with all the employees," he told Strahov where there is an understandable nervousness since there is no leadership.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios foreseen with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
“If there’s only one point of disagreement about how to vote in the third round, we’ll get over it.”
“Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there’s a new leader in its head,” Pelta said optimistically two days before the day likely to be crucial to his career as an official.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT will start working hard
"If current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at Thursday's General Assembly this would not please a lot of people," he said.
Rajchl, however, promises that in the case of being elected, we will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and makes the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I want to take care of football as a whole."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the national team, professional football and youth-performing football."
"But I'm not saying I'm going to do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I'm a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a particular area."
"And I'm going to distribute difficult missions for football to take a big step forward."
“A lot of people won’t be happy because it’s about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others,” he added.
He stated, it is said, that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know that I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know if it’s worth it and if I’ll have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and issue doubts about each of my actions,” he said.
“A lot of people still told me that I shouldn’t give up because they would give up too.”
"It's a trust I can't betray," he said.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
“Over the last two years there has been a lot of work and I don’t want to let it go.”
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I don't want anyone to stop them," he said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will not return to the way it was before Hasek.
“I believe in systematic work and that’s something Mirek Pelta can’t do.”
"There are people behind him who would play football in such a way that it would be only for those who were chosen."
“You can blame me for a number of things, but certainly not to bear one.”
“I try to be objective.”
“I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only with those who have been chosen.
And he once again confirms that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
“And if there are those who say the opposite, I’m willing to do my best for Moravia.”
"For example, it's time to consider the second division to be divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, whose winners would be in the first division."
"There wouldn't be a situation like it is now with only three Moravia teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot evaluate his own chances of winning.
"I always feel the support of the Czech House that elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes," said Rajchl, who among his future successes is considering saving tens of millions of crowns on over-the-counter contracts and disadvantages.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault to all.
While he says of Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him Czech football would lose its credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
“No one can doubt Plzen that he has done a great job this year.”
“If elected, he would surely continue in what Hasek started and would not make a significant change among the people in the Commissions.”
"He wouldn't want to ruin his successes," said Rajchl, who was evaluating his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
Julia Stanek
Ovni optics, magnificent Budapest swimming pools: Who travels through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after turning around the city or taking a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in hot tubs.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there was one thing she shouldn’t miss in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Extended on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored New Art of these converted pools.
If a covered swimming pool pleased her, she immediately noted in her book all the details of the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been surveyed in this way by the architect historian Meder and she presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bath"). The municipal covered swimming pools of Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the black forest, "concrete buildings in the Hardcore".
She has conducted her "most exceptional swim trips in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Aside from Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania, Poland, and a city in Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true passion for bathing culture.
Meder, explains that she doesn’t have much interest in the sport but he feels attracted to the water in a completely different way.
It's annoying that swimmers have to just watch blue tiles and accommodate the Javel's water spout while joggers breathe the fragrance envelope of the spicy forests or can listen to the park's gazing of joyful birds.
“I was wondering one day why the pools should actually always be so dirty,” the Vietnamese said.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A dive into a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - wellness factor in the swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders were to give themselves a little more credit, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor you have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"She is transparent on one side, but reflects on the other, however, the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high voids, multi-colored tiles, trenches.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the historic well-being oasis - it certainly gives the desire to jump in the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
Alongside splendid well-being baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing water in a natural cave in the karst (cavern bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths of which are filled in a jar of water and a jar of water containing it.
On the other hand, the outdoor heated swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zurich bath you can see the whole city, you can admire the snow-covered Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton. On the ski slope the turquoise bath is equipped with a slope
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the <0xC3><0x96>tztal mountains rise towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of Javel's water does not come from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulfur, the <0xC3><0x81>rpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be found in a health spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon glues you to the skin as soon as you let yourself slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for beautiful pools, Iris Meder was also disappointed: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor and outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she was in front of a barricaded terrain.
The bath designed by the architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902 was in the meantime closed.
By taking a look through the window of the New Art building in red-white-yellow, she observed the growth of bad herbs between the tiles.
She observed the opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: The Bad Wildbad Thermal Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; you can discover not only the neo-Roman elements that have emerged since its design in 1844, but also an Alhambra-style mausoleum that was added to it in 1900.
Since its meticulous modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite bath of the pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it originated in the Black Forest.
“It’s already a good yield than melting so different building styles into such a formidable unit,” Meder says.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural speculation
German bank examines speculation on commodities in detail
Christian Teevs
Does the German bank give up its speculation on commodities?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the leader of the group wants to take advantage of the consequences.
Hamburg - Hamburg
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this business avenue because it increases the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the speculation of the global commodities exchanges is pushing prices up and that banks share a complicity in global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is concretely aligned against the head of Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act the same way.
Raw materials speculation was initially introduced to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts in the meantime share the view that bettors have detached from bids and demands – and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted differently to criticism from U.S. competitors: He promised to investigate the allegations and said, “no case is worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank into play.”
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining Foodwatch-Report allegations.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be taken.
This could result in a reduction in the commodity market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation on rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way, to the extent that today's banks are detrimental to the general interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be particularly obligated today.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation," Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it’s about hungry people or whether the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake.”
Ackermann’s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it’s clear that the group’s CEO wants to present a perfect image, a few months before he leaves office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is planned within the Board of Directors.
He could improve his brand image by abandoning controversial agricultural speculation.
And about possible losses, he doesn't have to worry about it - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would eliminate investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have already participated in the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the survey on Tuesday, with which on November 7 and 8 the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people.
Only eleven percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such operations: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
43 percent would discourage such a bank from surrounding them, 49% answered that they would consider terminating their account to change banking.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian Pavilion for the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin.
It is now reopened and takes place as an exhibition house.
If you are enthusiastic about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear shapes, its glass hangars, its lively and bold allures and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in the technical progression of the universe, then the pavilion of the architect is good for the Bruxer58 in Austria.
The Schwanzer Pavilion once received the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its steel and glass construction, lightweight and suspended.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture to this day.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian Universal Exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW home and its adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His project of pavilion as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the southern station of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang artworks, so not a good environment.
However, it was also used for so long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly demolished.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name of "House of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvedere Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a blow of luck at all points of view.
The new departure was carried out by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career, among other things in her youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she led the private transformation of the public's works and the transformation of the public's works.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a café and a bookstore are there, and an office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and sensibly expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht and he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness due to his move to Vienna and his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: the "building was "a slump in energy," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, the insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was placed and the roof replaced with a special safety glass.
The thermal bridge beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a light panel tamed between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it's almost a new construction, but still the lightweight Schwanzer Pavilion.
The exterior doors of origins have remained, the house is painted in a shade of protection against red-brown rust.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for the monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and inexpensive had to be found, and that also appeal to the office of protection monuments," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building has remained flexible and lightweight.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and nevertheless wants to “awaken the good conscience”.
But in this case, the 21st century House is not in the wrong place, because if it is a blow to the luck of urban construction: just around the Jardin Suisse stands the newly planned "central station district", with offices and apartments.
And another chance will perhaps happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as he says, she is already negotiating with the city to get a site in the neighbourhood.
Bahn is planning a packed winter crisis in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in the winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million more in this regard this year.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung reported in advance, invoking an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of a total of about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million would be expected by 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the event of extreme weather conditions.
The number of internal and external workers for the deforestation of railway facilities and quays is expected, among other things, to double to 16,000.
The goal is to get rid of the snow and ice quays until the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the track devices needed for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Railway Chief Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the summit of train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of passengers, because it lacks, among other things, reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
This is why many new regional trains have been awaiting approval from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has for years to do, given that it has to check the axes of ICE trains significantly more often at the workshop, after an axle break took place on an ICE in the central station of Cologne.
German bank Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalties to the United States.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann, there is something new in the US: German bank Deutsche Bank has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the Deutsche Bank’s problems were already insufficient, the past of this sector giant also catches up in the US: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison <0x24>145 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106 million) to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Markets Regulator brings to large banks a whole series of accusations, inciting cooperative banks to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risk.
These documents have greatly lost value during the financial crisis and have driven banks down.
"We are pleased that we have been able to find a solution to this without the parties initiating a court proceeding," a Deutsche Bank spokesman said in New York.
In comparison, the Bank has not acknowledged any faults.
This is also true for Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of <0x24>20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and acts in case of bankruptcy to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair several billion dollars in damages.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks aside and in the summer he assigned to the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As regards the issue of mortgage documents, it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble exploded in 2007, this was fatal to a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events are already a few years old, at present it is blowing a stormy wind on American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous appeals to seek redress or to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks, both US real estate financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, of being in nature advantaged in mortgage transactions of about <0x24>200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with the FHFA, which is a number of transactions totalling <0x24>14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities demand that Frankfurter be liable for "substantial losses" but not to mention a specific sum.
Deutsche Bank has rejected the requests as unjustified and declares it wants to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett to raise <0x24>10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the guru of finance, invests colossal amounts in IBM’s IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than <0x24>10 billion.
Until then, U.S. major investor Warren Buffett continues to invest in IT companies, as the long-term evolution of companies leaves only bad prognosis.
However, he read IBM’s reports and changed his mind about investments in this sector.
It had to be understood much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and IT systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a knight's attack in the world of finance.
Therefore, the IBM IT business grants itself the right to now be called "Mr. IBM".
Buffett has revealed on CNBC's economic show that he has been buying <0x24>10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a major shareholder of IBM with a stake of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM had never known anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, which had provided reasonable profits even during the economic crisis.
“You’ve done a great job,” Buffett said strategically.
IBM has long relied on IT services for profit as the operation of accounting centers.
The computer pioneer, over 100 years old, offers both software and consulting as well as high-performance enterprise computers.
Buffett had so far rather avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in the companies he understands.
Buffett, on the other hand, attacks railway friction, lubricant manufacturers or machinery.
Its holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as stakes in a number of major groups such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
This 81-year-old had taken over in the 1960s the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and made it one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to smart investments.
However, her lifestyle is modest.
This is why it is a cult figure for many investors all over the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money earned him the nickname of "Omaha's Oracle".
After the announcement of Buffett’s investment, IBM’s shares increased by one percent on the stock exchange.
“Big Blue,” as it’s also called IBM, has a stock market value of over <0x24>220 billion and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, says Buffett, he doesn’t want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell", the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloodful ideology", which would now be reborn.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek enterprise in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkish people, the long-dead spectrum has reappeared: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this far-right context against the Turks.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany has never been questioned.
However, the far-right network that has been detected reveals proportions whose dimension is far from predictable.
"Is it a return to the bloody ideology," "That was the title of the online publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, points out that one of the authors was a v-man in the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right bourbier.
The Turkish community in Germany has reacted in a reasonable way: it called for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence at the Brandenburg gate this weekend.
It was only two weeks before the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a 50th anniversary ceremony of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with gay colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
Reports from some Turkish media make the effect of a gifle: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Thus, the German publication of the "Hürriet" does not deprive itself of unambiguous conditions.
"It starts to puberty," Tel is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronicle.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid taxes and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was seen very critically in the German-Turkish forums and these had subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why it hasn’t come to the minds of the German authorities much earlier to do research in some suspected far-right circles, the authors wonder.
More than one is ready at least for rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be stalled, there will be nothing left for migrants but self-defense and arms."
“It will be the best self-defense.”
"The internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of the information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," writes Selen.
What this means if inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s explained well.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which mistrust and distance by acts of violence could lead.
The attacks, however, aggravated our feeling in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks that the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the head of state of Turkey, he was made to be represented at the funerals in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was counting at the time in his speech, how much the local population taxed.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax burdens.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how much Germano-Turkish distrust has been deepened towards the state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts to clarify and reevaluate far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Scandal Bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and skates from crisis to crisis.
He's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, we knew in July that he would occupy a nearly as spectacular position in 2013: Chairman of the Management Board of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber has publicly welcomed, congratulated; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recently obtained solidity and has made friendly comments on future colleagues.
"UBS succeeded the Turnaround".
"I look forward to collaborating with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
And yet, as of September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had diverted all of the Bank’s security systems and burned about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.7 billion.
The head of the board of directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS has since been considered suffering – and everyone is asking: When is Axel Weber finally coming back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the administration presidency already in May – not in 2013, as the bank said on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
He then assumes responsibility for a bank’s strategy, which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of “Europe’s biggest scandal bank”.
In fact, UBS is huge on one side – until recently, it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other, it has been skating from one scandal to the other for years.
Nothing, it seems, saves the proud Swiss bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also ruthless, had combined it with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So UBS was managing one side in 2007 with <0x24>1.6 billion more money coming from an easy customer base than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later banking professor for many years in Zurich says: "I have always taken UBS as a model of good banking in front of my students."
"In the present perspective, one is wondering: how could I have just been wrong at this point?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007, it appeared that for the first time something didn’t turn around at UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who was so far regarded as an intellectual as well as a great banker.
A few months later, we found out why he had left.
The bank’s division had flared with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross on billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of CHF 13 billion and made a cross on it.
For this, she has indeed found investors, but who, shortly before, would have cracked her eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was silenced, to the point that its name was never even known.
This was only the first time.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank was once again to announce billions in losses, and the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still Switzerland’s second highest-paid board in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS, given its investment errors, was in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from the UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for convertible bonds into shares, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic this can be for a small country, to be home to such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of UBS 2007 increased to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
“We weren’t able to save the UBS again,” said Geiger, a bank researcher.
After the first disaster, it was followed by the second.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated due to a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the easy customer, who had scammed the tax perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, she accepted a payment of <0x24>780 million - in return for unwarranted profits from these operations with an increased fine.
Thus, the UBS has more or less published that it has assisted in tax fraud.
At the same time, she has lost something that has always been her capital in competition with rich clients: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of the head of the Board of Directors and the chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of clients' money.
Thus, the bank had lost credibility in the two main business sectors within a few months: banking investment due to poor speculation and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And, as there was a somewhat calm return, and as we thought, that the UBS would get out of it, followed by this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.7 billion flame-trader, before the bank realized something was going wrong.
And it’s published: with risk management in investment banks it still doesn’t seem to work.
“With the Adoboli case, it was found that the control of risks has changed too little,” said Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Zurich University Banking Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with the UBS is that it does not have control over the risks in hand."
However, it was precisely the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long held their position, to become the guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money – and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS plant in Zurich will still be paired with the solid Swiss private bank cliché - it's just a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank is headquartered at Zurich Central Station, which drives directly from Zurich Lake Central Station, which itself is surrounded by the snowy summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the rentals of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional stores as well as those at the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have lived here: from the national bank through the Swiss Credit Palace to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank's logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another deviated from the market – or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, the UBS and the Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, ultimately like all Swiss bankers he does business with both major banks as well.
The UBS would have become far too large, he finds – especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would have also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say.
"And yet, they have long adapted to the morals of the Anglo-Saxons."
This was in fact the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then downgraded: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the large Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday, the small-sized government coalition of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in their nation's history," wrote author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS crash".
With up to 68 billion francs, or <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 billion, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that have happened?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks joined a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for small Switzerland – and has been constantly growing.
What helped was that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as strong as the asset management in Zurich and a poorer one, but of course already more strongly internationalized.
All of a sudden, international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, UBS Group Chief from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” said Hans Geiger, a banking researcher.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who is very well understood in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who broke a path to the summit with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted himself until the end at Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: “He thought his models were the reality,” says Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly remembers the meetings of the leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group always spoke the same word: detronizing Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to go all the way up.
Some stages have already succeeded.
In terms of currency and securities transactions, it played a very important role.
Business advisors, who were responsible for this, however, highlighted a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference from the largest banks.
The UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS was embarking on an adventure that nearly cost him his life.
Dried by growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has turned into a massive machine that has packed and passed U.S. mortgage-based securities - but has also kept risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking to go down.
“Already in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there,” said Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts turned out to be harder than we thought.
Posts at UBS have become ejectable and are banking so far.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
It needs to find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: putting an end to the investment bank, focusing on asset management, returning to the Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn’t want to (yet) go that far.
But the investment bank has to atrophie vigorously, as it is clear so far.
Bank Manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world next Thursday.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only supposed to be on a temporary basis when the bank separated by surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it has been imposed: it must run the UBS business sustainably, the Zurich Bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of the mid-1990s.
He cancelled 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who's she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly asked himself.
He said publicly so far only that he was going to look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock exchange
The threat of a recession in Europe over the weekend has discouraged U.S. investors.

Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from banks.
The legendary investor Warren Buffett just confirmed this caution: “It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis,” he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was too early from his point of view to invest in bonds coming from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle into the wind and entered the American technology industry.

Intelligent corneals are spreading in cities
In many places, strawberries are considered a "bird problem" but experts say that these very intelligent animals have not been allowed to hunt down cities for a long time.
Some like them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Cornelia has been in the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are increasing due to the dirt and noise of the animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on the corneals, experts said that it is no longer possible to hunt the beetles of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
The problems of the cities were also based on the exodus of particularly protected brakes: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional living spaces.
The hunting, arranging and killing of typical cauliflower trees made life difficult for birds.
Cornelia is under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 couples in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative ads because of the Cornelia massacre in the area.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their slaughter with particularly brutal gourdins.
"The normal expulsion, the event, is for nothing," Leer city and landscape planner Werner Klöver said.
The destruction of nests by means of pressure water or the killing of trees often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals move away, large colonies divide and they disperse elsewhere."
The event is only conceivable in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
“We find ourselves obliged to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them.”
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Designable is a combination of the event of animals with aversive packaging and attaching offers, so as to allow them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens prospected "from info panels instead of trimmers" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better bear a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger Walking-Educational Crab in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the lives of these very intelligent beetles.
This project has been adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "There is a large number of communication, these birds have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Brakes not only use working instruments to reach a shelf, but they themselves manufacture their tools as working instruments.
Ethologists at the University of Cambridge have recently tested four brakes, how far bird intelligence has come.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to make a shed with stones to reach a larvae.
Without much training, they definitely recognized that a stone had to have some thickness and shape to make the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the clever corneals then had to solve a more trapped problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small shark with a larva.
Birds couldn’t reach their butt with their beak.
However, the researchers had put iron wire pieces at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small shark of the small hose.
Three of the four brakes were successful from the very beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo draws Portugal at the 2012 European Championships
The hopes of a coup of Bosnians and Turks remained unsuccessful.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the eliminations at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and suddenly eliminated Ukraine.

Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11-metre penalty hand-played (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) made a double shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was faced with a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the eliminations for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured departure.
Ronaldo sent a free kick of 30 meters in advance in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his distance shooting qualities and shot at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half-hour, had their first clear chance thanks to attacking Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English Manchester City championship, initiated a headball directed down the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scored a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally, arbitrator Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the center of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the opposite side, Stark awarded an 11-metre penalty played by the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic certainly diverged.
But, after the break, the 2004 European vice-champion succeeded four times and everything became clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the finals in the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for the fifth time.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), was also lucky and had to survive a shock moment in the initial phase.
The goalkeeper Petr Cech blocked a last-minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface just next to Cech’s shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the rescue of the world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs already shot, once again, the attacker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end has finally clarified everything.
Turkey lost the football miracle of Zagreb during this time.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb were unable to go beyond a 0-0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to leave his place on the third-place bench of the 2002 European Championship, the Croatians were able to enjoy their fourth round in the final of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia gained more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croatians did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund at 62 e Minute, the Bundesliga Legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the field.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.

Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed to the top speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Los Angeles Galaxy's Robbie Keane got the first good chance.
Only at the last moment Estonia's defense was able to prevent a possible goal from the -first goalkeeper.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense from goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was on hand and would close the ball to the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software company, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about <0x24>2 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5 billion) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly,” announced CEO Bill McDermott to his customers on a fair basis in Beijing.
The staff will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the global leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP’s 176,000 global customers are located in this expanding country.
China’s growth plans are also an important component of the Dax Group’s 2015 Strategy.

SAP has been active in China for more than 20 years.
“Now we want to expand our operations (...),” McDermott said.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
The personal mass slaughter
Peter Englund's new book, entitled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War), begins with a long list of characters that close your heart.
A tip to get started: carefully scrape this page and make it your bookmark.
In this novel story by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a tag during these few moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the fogs of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book that he describes, accurately, as "an anti-history work."
It contains a few well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; almost no ambassador or discussion of strategies and equipment is found.
It’s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a “book describing what it could look like.” There are “feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.”
"Beauty and Sadness" summarizes the experiences in wartime of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, from both sides of the war, from young schoolchildren and botanists to climbers, from doctors, ambulance workers and sellers.
Some of them will become heroes.
Some of the prisoners of war will lose members, become mad, or lose their lives.
Their lives here are vacillating like the beams of a church: while some are extinguished, new ones are lighted up.
Peter Englund's book differs from traditional history books.
It denies the idea that World War I is summarized only by the terrible war of the trenches on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sadness" skillfully describes other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under the husks; one passes Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse-tse-fly is an untreatable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, such as a hurricane Katrina that puts the cord on.
When gunshots hold away, and you're a mother at home, do you stay or run away?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, not even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, “the lack of facts has been overwhelmed by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
"Beauty and Sadness" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young navy of the German High Sea Fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
Versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but they are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most address deprivation and the ability to get out of it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on substitute food in Germany.
It describes the "meat made of boiled rice crushed in sheep fat (and finished with a fake wooden bone); the tobacco made with dry roots and dry skin of potatoes; soles of wooden shoes."
It states that "837 authorised substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories deal with honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own impulse towards wildlife and declares about the war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were meant for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a civil whiskey at hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, like a snout and a snout.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at great risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
“When one is resigned to sacrifice oneself, one hopes to have an audience,” he writes.
Unfortunately, it’s more like “a man convicted secretly strangled.”
Other observations concern the decline of old Europe and new types of terror.
“Conflict is becoming more and more a story of economic competition,” writes Peter Englund, “a war between factories.”
He sees the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the early-century bestiary: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-sized clothes, who executes his bakery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch a Venetian disease at prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in pus trade due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and scalp on genitals in hopes of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
“The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into blindness for life.”
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but non-ostentatory, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasped the way the war "caused exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion to religion."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making war on them.
The best works dealing with World War I are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "To the West Nothing New", by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's book is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming one I’ve read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it was as if he had emerged from his book, seized from your hands this page where there is a list of people and burned with a lighter.
After a first false step, a meticulously planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing anti-smoke helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen as the Zuccotti park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret to all but a few high-ranking officers and other informants from the start of an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could be no repetition of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, who went against the department’s regulation and generated a storm of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clean up the Zuccotti Park of its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police were preparing to watch the occupancy in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island, for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots—anti-terrorist measures that involve moving a large number of police officers quickly—to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place on Monday evening, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders given to move into the park arrived "at the last minute," said a man, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few policemen I know and who have been called did not know they were going to Zuccotti Park," the person said.
“The only ones who know they’ll be there are at the top of the police department’s hierarchy.”
The city has learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean the park but were pushed back by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from across the district - from dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people went and came to the park during the day, as migrants, so an hour in the morning was a convenient time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency vehicles equipped with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The recorded lights and messages holding loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
While community affairs officers would enter the park equipped with their light blue windshields, many protesters simply gathered their affairs and left.
No tents were hit before 1:45 a.m., the police said, which left time for occupants to gather their cases.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were needed.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the Police Department, said the measure had been taken only for security reasons.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, brutally detained by officers.
Mr. Browne said television camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved westwards through the crowded business of the protesters, including luggage, plastic lawn and sheet bags filled with clothes, teams from the sanitation department followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged, and the images were posted on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
About a dozen people at the epicenter of the camp hanged together.
Finally, two people were chained to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services were called to cut the chains.
No arrests took place in the park before 3:30 p.m., Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Mostly for "disorder to public order and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the highest-ranking officer on the spot.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "didn't lead the operations," Browne said.
A second group of police officers were patient along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades have been placed on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as Pine Street, south.
We saw the police extend the perimeter far beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away from them.
Almost 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most lively activities of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5:00 p.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car and others were spotted scraping the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of counter-plate emerged flying from the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a protester were hospitalized.
The School Aids Syndicate Continues to Seek City for Dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school aid workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to try a trial in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
Prosecutions are probably the union's ultimate weapon, the 37th District Council, to try to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and sixty-two school aids, parents' coordinators and other employees, who were among the least paid in the city, lost their jobs on 7 October. The union leaders compared these dismissals to a political revenge for not letting the city have access to a last fund for health care directed by the budget of the first-time workers and groups.
Municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissals were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council responded, noting that dismissals of school aid were not in any way specified in the budget.
Officers of the 37th District Council said they would complete a complaint notice, warning the Department of Education that it would be pursued; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to formally announce prosecutions to the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the City Education Department will be the defending party, representing eight black-coloured workers, all of Latin American origin, like most school aid workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would put on the number of dismissals in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to an under-resolution.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and a few barely in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa establishments, 17 school aids have lost their jobs in Brownsville’s 23rd District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the Southern Districts of the Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school aids employed at Harlem 36 Public School, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, prosecutions say that "It's not a neighborhood of easy parents who can bring funds to fill the budget deficit."
The budget of the public school 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each disadvantaged student enrollment.
The union also claims that high school directors may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memo used the term "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six parent coordinators were fired," and "not just because of oversight."
Mission completed: Congress finds agreement on the question of Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats finally found an agreement in the Cape on the issue of the Libyan uprising.
It will have taken a successful uprising, the capture and death of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, backed by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding their people for "revolution" and "revolution."
"This resolution is about honoring the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties have entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at endorsing or not the U.S. military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain filed a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and has never been voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day as the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a measure aimed at reducing funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission has therefore remained in the form of legislative purgatory - Congress angry enough to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
The indecision of the Congress was overturned by the events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31st.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Foreign Relations Committee "congratulations the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination towards freedom" and "congratulations to the men and women of the U.S. armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people and their fanatic profession."
The resolution also asserts "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure gain all the support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Commission or will it divide the legislators as in June?
Senator and Commission President Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said on Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
In the Capitol, the House must vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to get a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a floor vote in the House or the Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to endorse their amendments, but this is not without trying.
The Goodlatte amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments to be tabled in Congress on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations from a previous one.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment in the House only for a balanced budget, and another handle that would "control federal spending."
Some of these bills are identical, but they give their support - especially the new Republicans who want to give their CV - the chance to boast of being the "author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act (Budget Control Act) passed last August required the House and Senate to vote on a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of terms during which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to raise the limit of two terms for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the profanation of the flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states oppose it.
As eager as the members have been to offer amendments, they are not as fast as they have been in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The rate slowed from the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed in Congress in 1789.
"Massacred but not beaten," Gabrielle Giffords said in her first TV interview since the shooting.
Ten months after an armed man shot at him in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrate-Arizona) appeared on Monday night in a television show, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to get back to the gym.
When she appeared in the television newspaper "20/20" on ABC, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The show approached his difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing his head.
Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and wounded thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and described her recovery as "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords replied “very well.”
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special edition of an hour of "20/20", broadcast the eve of the couple's new book entitled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special show traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, his shaved head and a wide scar on the forehead.
She can only use one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair as doctors teach her how to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What".
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
Videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: the representative is seen singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin"?
In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with doctors, said she did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading to her an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped her and asked for information about the six people killed in the incident for the first time.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated while waiting for trial.
"There were a lot of deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, “I was beaten.”
“Then I’d say, ‘Gabby, you haven’t been beaten,’” said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massacred.
And you're gonna get out of it, recover and come back even stronger than ever.
More compassion than respect for the troops
The event: a gala in Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for New York City homeless veterans.
Kid Rock has sung a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in costume-cravate stood at his feet to applaud him.
“The military, men and women, are considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraising.
A senior military officer present at the gala, in which also Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Army, participated, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were presented as sort of an orphan," the military senior wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, it was just mercy.
Absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have settled between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, some military officials say.
The public is acting more and more as if it was regrettable for men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq, said in a statement.
“But it would seem that the only way to support us is to enclose ourselves in the role of unlucky spirits.”
This is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the returning troops from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most of the conversations about mercy take place in confidence among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the battle with the Marines, retired colonel Mark Canciano warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if “a furious and violent veteran is hiding under the surface,” said Canciano, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the Washington government.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some of the people who were interviewing him were subtly asking if he would be able to keep under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after he returned from the fight.
"When you approach the subject of the service, you are faced with negative impressions," recalls Colonel Canciano when speaking to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely welcomed by a country so unfamiliar with the army and which sees little direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of the politicians and the people largely focus on the depth of a soldier’s suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of hard service periods, the number of lost friends or the extent of injuries.
The army faced increasing pressure to sever against the rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction in respect of rapes.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant on the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She was returning to her store at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a packet of beers.
He asked her if she could join him in his room for a drink.
"C" was an alarm signal," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane has put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I had to follow my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman’s room, the man grabbed her from behind, threw her to the ground and raped, she claims.
This week, November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and others not, will eagerly await the decision of the court at a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a trial brought against the former Secretary of Defense, Donald has read his case, and his wife, Robert Gates.
The latter are accused of not stopping the generalization of rape within the army, thereby violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number rose to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or abused sexually by colleagues of soldiers. They also claim that the army did not suit them after they were interrogated or interrogated.
Susan Burke says she takes care of the military, because the problem starts with them.
“The military is a vertical structure,” she said.
"Who are the individuals in a position to 'eradicate the culture of retaliation?
The lawyer also said that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom may be part of future prosecutions.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the complainants in this case - thus putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will initiate several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused to the armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Fair Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active service personnel.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants," the documents state.
The Department of Defense refused to make any comments.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to battle, this distinction is only on paper: the frontlines of recent wars are rarely only masculine.
In Iraq as well as in Afghanistan, female soldiers teams are playing an increasingly important role, in particular in contacting local women.
Out of these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives – two-thirds in combat.
"It's time for the military to modernize," said Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation is preparing a lawsuit against the army, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorders" attributed to victims of rape in order to give them leave - a relatively common fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru's women's rights group A Network's women's action.
His group filed a trial with the Veterans Administration in December, accusing them of discriminatory practices in how to deal with claims for benefits for persons who claim to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defense.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, in fact, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The March report also studies the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the military were prosecuted - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
Complainants of Susan Burke’s case describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumas.
In the Lyman case, she informs the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail about her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a rape kit (literally a rape kit), and her aggressor's blood - due to a break in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sits before a judge, in a trial in which she is questioned about her sexual relationship with her boyfriend earlier the day of her aggression.
Six people testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator of the crime, who ended up being discharged.
“I remember the day the verdict was rendered,” said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after the court."
“I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I came out, I remember telling my commander, ‘It wasn’t his trial, it was mine.’”
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, it was repatriated under less than honorable terms, preventing it from receiving any benefit.
Whether Lyman and the other complainants will go ahead or not is a long story, says John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington’s Law School.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticised since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army has been behind for decades because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence set by responsibility.
"The odds are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he added.
These things only change when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the plaintiff’s lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for other trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform," she said.
Where until we die, one or the other of the two options.
Walls Have Eyes: Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy who was part of his online anti-immigration opinions.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to being taken from a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was faced with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, chatting with a few of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
It's easy... Log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to find them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is packed with so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they’re looking for with scientific precision — the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett’s team found that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to their own survey. At their own level, their vulnerability, and questions related to their level of concern.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question 10,000 supporters from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without leaving the office.
“This is a new way of doing research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, “those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screen.”
The DEMOS study is just an example of how Facebook has become the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Thinking groups, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that touch on health issues such as social trends, thanks to "Like", wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, the "supernova of data" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research works whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people you might not be able to approach in the street.
“Earlier, when you were trying to investigate people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You should have gone to the party, but they would never have allowed you in,” Bartlett said.
“Facebook avoids all this – you have direct access to their information.”
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their drunken exploits were significantly more likely to be alcoholic than students who were discreet about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as advisors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
“You can’t treat a problem if you don’t diagnose it,” Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute, says the Washington Post.
“We know how to identify children at risk, and who would otherwise not be recognized.”
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The data team at the site studied statistics on the love situation and Valentine's Day, the rate of participation in the 2010 midterm elections and a national happiness index (thanks to the information only available - the champions of digital freedom have long searched for other people's data at the end of the site.
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven’t even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information differently from going through the Internet, there is something else online.
"I don't think a large number of users have ever thought that a researcher could study their profile," said Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing his students' Facebook walls.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user’s wall.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things,” Selwyn said.
Therefore, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a notebook and a pen remain the best tools that can be used.
“Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,” he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social, it's not in front of a computer."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik's First Appearance
Anders Behring Breivik, who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Norwegian Templars," he said in front of a 500-person hearing room.
“As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I reject it because you hold your mandate as organizations supporting a hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I acknowledge the facts, but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he “didn’t want to let him use this trial to express his opinions.”
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, talk to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some have come in the hope of looking Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure it would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally made some progress after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Wearing a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, looking journalists and survivors in and out of court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not insane. He also stated that there is no evidence that he was acting with accomplices.
The July 22 attacks therefore appear to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the sadness or confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but that's not the case," a parent of the victim said.
"It would have been much easier."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview at Cinema This Week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical engineer and inventor of modern computer science.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recently found Steve Jobs interview and which will be broadcast this week as the first part of a film on the main markets, is how much this creative spirit had understood the product’s processes and workflows.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organigram enhancer - a man who believed that many business executives were suffering from a "disease that leaves them thinking of a work that could be a work of genius...
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds", which traces the birth of the computer, and he sat with Steve Jobs for more than an hour for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years since Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aiming for a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in transportation.
It was only after Steve Jobs' death that a full video was found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly uplifted, is the basis of the 68-minute film titled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be aired in theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technology philosophies and business strategies.
It's incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also moments when Steve Jobs’ perfectionism resurfaces, where he seems impatient to hear Cringely’s questions, giving him a beating to make him accelerate and move on to questions or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, Steve Jobs assesses what he sees as good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read the posthumous reviews of Steve Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
It has a vision of how things can be and should be.
He explains them and then implements them.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a company:
“All these years, I’ve always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers are constantly the same: ‘Oh, just because you have to do them.’”
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by giving details of his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed about the way costs were recorded - often started with a "standard cost" assessed from the nose and then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured the accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour with the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that used to hack phone networks and call for free over long distances.
The device has been the subject of many writings before, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
“We wrap the ball of different things about a half-dozen times and you scream in the public phone and it happened a minute later on the public phone next door,” Jobs laughs.
“We were young and, thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We didn’t know much about each other, but we were able to invent a little thing that could control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs goes on to tell a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak made: he called to the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night, pretending to be Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go insanely laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
About his love for technology (and Bill Hewlett's departure):
At the age of 12, while hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and gives him a wire shot.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This has had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it has shaped my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP’s employees to visit the company’s research labs, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the “first desktop computer ever designed.”
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a small cathode tube, and I fell in love with it.
The teen I was returning to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the Improvisation of Innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products at a glance.
At the beginning of his career, as he sets out to sell a few printed circuit boards, a client asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at just 30 credit days, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember a lot of big fights... I was yelling at them saying it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost <0x24>300]. I had enough of it, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for <0x24>15 and that turned out to be incredibly reliable.
About the big companies that are blowing up:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders would be mistaken and lose control of their market share.
“Let’s say you’re working at IBM or Xerox, doing a better copywriter or a better printer, and then?”
You have the market monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these are the types of people] that end up leading companies and product specialists are discarded from decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can’t imagine conceiving a good product compared to a bad product – the required manual work.
That's what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire IT industry.
It could have done ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They pulled the defeat to the victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
“A huge part of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
There are compromises to do... Some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them to each other.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It’s about trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you’re creating.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal great ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren’t for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health law as court meets
The day when the Supreme Court meets in closed court to discuss the issue of political disagreement, namely whether the opposition to President Obama’s health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noted during a dinner sponsored by the law firm’s attorney-at-law.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered for a conference to discuss petitions for review.
One of the cases involved a trial initiated by 26 states contesting the ambitious health care reform voted by Congress last year, a law that was a rally point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental 5:30 p.m. argument is expected in March next, and the result will likely be of a nature to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be on the rise at the time the court’s decision will be rendered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue on the rejection of the law will likely be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. general counsel during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clément’s law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was part of the two dozen cabinets that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another cabinet that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that contested the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial challenge in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and an opponent of the Health Act.
The guests starring at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from a code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend fundraising from law-related organizations and others even though the judge cannot be an intervener, an honorary guest, or listed on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the case’s law firms, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
“The judges drank and dined and at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases in court.”
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event disproves any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little respect for critics claiming that they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
In addition, conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general counsel for the Obama administration when the first objections to the law were brought to the court of first instance.
His critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had invested too much in law enforcement to be impartial.
Kagan didn't give any indication that she would.
Boeing records <0x24>18 billion order for airliners
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777s, two-course liners, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than <0x24>1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order contemplating 50 of its products.
This, on the other hand, is a whole deal when the airline in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches a record amount of <0x24>18 billion.
Equally incredible is who Boeing got this order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released Monday, the Chicago airline estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth a total of <0x24>450 billion over the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing informed of the order of the most expensive commercial aircraft in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-courses.
It was the Dubai-based Emirates airline that passed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to buy another 20 aircraft, raising the total order amount to <0x24>26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said on Monday that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that flattened significant fuel and convenience savings for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than <0x24>1 billion.
“This is clearly very positive for Boeing,” said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
So they have not only the means to pay for these planes, but an increase in the price of fuel – usually damaging to airlines as it represents their most important expenses – would not be so harmful to them as the country would make money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these airlines will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their airline orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural risk coverage," he said.
Emirates’ order strengthens Boeing’s prevalence in the large-carrying aircraft market and helps slow down Airbus’ attempt to harass its competitor with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing’s victory at the aeronautical fair comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the debut of the largest version of the A350, which rivals directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is delaying its debut to increase its propulsion following its customers’ demand to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing’s shares increased by 1.5% to <0x24>67.94.
Mexican President’s Sister Manifestly Strikes in Michoacán Elections
Luisa Maria Calderon says drug traffickers helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race to the post of governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her attempt to access Michoacán's governorship during violent elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the head of the race as governor of this western state.
“The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the entire country,” said Luisa Maria Calderon in an interview on Monday following the election.
“They have threatened our candidates, our election agents... They have seized the urns, installed road dams... and forced people to vote” for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But he is organizing his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have noticed little of Calderon, who was in the lead of polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother’s Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a leftist candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently serves as governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any link with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the state of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence persisted.
A week before the election, a PAN mayor was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates locally resigned from the campaign out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as Michoacán's elections are, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man who is expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
The BASD strongly encourages Asia to come in aid to the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would hinder the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of BASD based in Manila, said the two world’s fastest-growing economic powers should “do everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and noted that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We’re all together in this crisis.”
"Therefore, anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent but it is not safe."
"So if China and India can help, nothing will stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been severely shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan has dangerously increased and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The flourishing sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that the global economy will return to recession, and has sparked a call for major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that the IMF would send any Asian aid, but he also said that bilateral assistance – such as buying the obligations of the U.S. financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – would provide greater negotiating power to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, India's Minister of Commerce and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy is now suffering from a drop in exports and a strain on foreign capital arrivals.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and agitated,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges to face and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a choice, it’s an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the wealthy Europeans while facing their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get aid to 1.2 billion Indians in Europe, of which at least 800,000 live with <0x24>2 a day, or even less.
"One day, they will find out that the Greeks are retired at 50 and they are going on a holiday in the sun and they will have trouble swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis could cause "significant repercussions" across Asia.
BASD’s forecasts for 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now face “loss risks” due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "develop relief plans" to protect themselves from economic turmoil and major capital leaks.
Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defence Reductions
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, raised pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budgetary compressions would undermine national security. He triggered a financial chain reaction of the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan.
The Pentagon is already apportioning <0x24>450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but now fears an additional <0x24>600 or more of compression is imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is called kidnapping would result in 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"A reduction so significant, applied without discernment, would render most of our ships and construction projects unenforceable - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on unpaid leave to achieve the goal."
“These changes would shock the faith of those who support our military and would seriously damage our preparation.”
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
"While the wartime financing of the accounts of foreign contingency operations is not directly affected by kidnapping, war effort would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in basic budgets," Panetta said.
“The contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and oversight of contracts that support the war.”
“Wage management staff would be reduced, resulting in payment delays to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a kidnapping on the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power.”
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon during the publication of Panetta's letter.
“It’s not a consequence with which we can live, and it’s certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it shouldn’t have to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent senators’ warnings increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he himself reached the top position of the Pentagon cumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult choices.
At a news conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what could happen – a military with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet-free brigade."
"It's a fighter jet, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
"It's a depressed force, poorly prepared and unable to deal with potential opponents."
"In fact, she invites the aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could "generate significant operational risks: response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limitations on our ability to deploy and engage us in unsustainable operations in the world; and at risk.
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could go to the shed, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal battleship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Stopping the development and testing of the F35 could generate <0x24>80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at recent snippets indicates how ubiquitous deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with prosecution for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was picked up by an open microphone stating to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies have destroyed careers and devastated countries.
New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner has been turned into an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with violations of campaign funding related to the coverage of an extramarital bond.
And then, none of those who have lived through history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered while lying about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky during his second term.
Cheating stories to school and university tests are legions.
There have been cases where teachers gave the test responses to students in order to get a good look at their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.
How many deceptions do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a social game similar to, say, friends, where the goal is to write: "I've had you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six decades in such psychophy, in particular in a prestigious research project in a deep-seated university.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been demystified.
The liars look you in the eye.
They don’t always bleed, redden or stir.
Don’t conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to uncover.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, question formation, and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific findings in the vast body and always emerging knowledge about deception, and it is clear that detecting deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include, among other things, the management of deception.
Good liars are able to read others well, comforting them, managing their own emotions, and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that the extravertises lie more than the introverts, that men say more lies "centered on them" while women say more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less to their spouses than to their mates.
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is what we call "setting the reference data."
This helps to provide a benchmark for measuring subsequent changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, the laughter, the voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally shakes their feet permanently so as not to make unfair accusations when you see them shake their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for hints of verbal and non-verbal misleading behavior.
Consider these signs as red flags, not evidence of fraud.
Deceptive people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet to the door, lean towards an exit, significantly change posture, or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all questions are not difficult.
Questioners often falsely indicate that the interview is completed just to try to trigger the post-interview response.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
Famous Scott Peterson scrambled using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals can also use a remote language: “I haven’t had sexual intercourse with this woman...Mrs. Lewinsky” or completely repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wooden language" when answering a difficult question: "Well...to be honest...if I remember well...to my knowledge."
This makes the response perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances of avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial pipeline plan to be disrupted after U.S. late-approval threat
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - sparking trade union anger while calming environmentalists - the company looking to build the oil pipeline says it is ready to redirect them to the project.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that it will move the projected pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually get the approval of an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department's announcement last week that it would delay its decision to issue a federal permit for the project until it receives new studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the dunes of Nebraska and the O'aquarium.
"It's a real way forward," Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would probably have delayed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the policy involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department decision, and expressed his support for it.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to Texas refineries.
To do this, he would have to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, which have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed this plan are pressuring a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills region and the Ogallalaa aquarium, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State’s ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department’s Inspector General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist engaged by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice by its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that Disco diva Patti LaBelle launched in a chain of violence in the hall of their Manhattan building, terrifying their little girl to the point where she vomited out of fear.
"Lady Marmalade's move frightened 18-month-old Geneviève Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 last year when stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife kindergarten teacher, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk descended into the hall of their building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped near the door and had put her daughter for a moment.
“Someone came after me and said, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing?’ I said, ‘Yes,’ and I went to get her,’” she said.
LaBelle told the pregnant woman in anger.
“She told me about an aggressive tone: ‘You shouldn’t leave your daughter near the door,’ says Roseanna Monk.
"I said, 'What you say or think I don't care.'
She got angry and started using vows - the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying me with the water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’ said the child’s mother.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother—who always held Geneviève in her arms—and had to be restrained by her surroundings that drove her to a car waiting for them, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loudly that she started to vomit, she adds.
Later, the family sent an apology note from LaBelle, but received no response.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case for free and that the family is considering donating all the money received to a cancer charity for children.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially towards a motherhood teacher carrying an 18-month-old child.”
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment decreased and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, which has generated great expectations in terms of the progress of the economy, but given the economic adversity of the beginning of the year, it indicates a beginning of the year.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing losses of trillions for the agricultural sector, limited the opportunities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the economic growth of other sectors, which has a historical decrease of 31 per cent.
According to the report of the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were 582 million 835 hectares of crop damage, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent suffered damage because the main damages were damaged, and the main damages were damaged.
According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment in the state was increased by one hundred per cent in the first two quarters of the year, and by one hundred per cent in the first hundred of the year, the rate of unemployment increased by one hundred per cent, from one hundred per cent to five per cent.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly based on actions carried out by public policy.
"What is observed is an increase in unemployment that is due to a number of factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering," because for people who use something, they say that it's easy to make money in an illegal way to invest them.
Detained migration
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first because of difficulties in entry and secondly because they already have a lot of difficulty in finding work, these people stay here and ask for work sources, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Lack of Seriousness
The labour market analysis in Sinaloa is aggravated by the high level of serious lack of work conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state work there without contributing as a worker to any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and serious shortages, another reason for the state's shift is low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the registries of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is 7,375 pesos.
Contracting of IED
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011 there was the strongest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment of the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June, the IED of the State reached <0x24>630,697 million in the same year, which is <0x24>3 million per year from <0x24>147.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the Government of the State accounted for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, mainly recorded by companies in the tertiary sector.
Let this
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the State requested in July to the public congress the approval of a loan of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy until the end of November, and the weight of the economy was approved.
Reactions
For representatives of the employer sector, the first year of Mario López Valdés’s Government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industries, said that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align everyone's effort and above all the good progress is already synchronized.
Economic lens
Loredo López said that events such as the frosts of the beginning of the year have restrained the state economy and restricted its yield and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced by several events, among which frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not rotate fast enough to generate economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of e flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year, we say that we have a lot of
Redefine the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of the patronage of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that we want to channel the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done, we think it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources be detonated," he says.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
“In general, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in various areas, there are some advances in economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term program,” he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to be done," he said.
Convicted for 8 pounds of marijuana
A person residing in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed that the small trafficker convicted is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in his variant of marijuana possession for sale.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army officers on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was circulating in a pick-up truck, white, in which he was carrying a black bag in the vehicle’s trunk and in the place of the co-pilot a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items have been made available to the Second District Judge and the convict is still in the Centre for the Execution of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debt towards Contributions to Works
Social work included in programs such as Habitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 for Migrants may not be complete where serious delays due to lack of economic resources are recorded, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development stated that while construction programs have so far progressed, they are at risk, as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions exceeding the 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He noted that in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they have given us nothing, even if since July they had to give us a part of it," he said, "and we, in order not to record any delays, have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided at that time.
"We had already undergone this in the previous sex period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to work and this year we, in order to have access to these programs, had to get the resources to cover what the state had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment by the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the managements so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
“They have to provide almost <0x24>12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they haven’t given us anything.”
The Court validates the "analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has sparked constitutional controversies that the Senate and the House of Representatives have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog coup" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to invalidate it have not been reached.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be followed to realise the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed because it did not reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft judgment, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as unconstitutional, due to the fact that the regulation on radio and television is a statutory assignment to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of subordination and hiibernation.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all actions envisaged by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of ministers also resolved to raise the complaint made by the House of Representatives, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said he disagreed with the project's arguments, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure the measures through general standards so that the public administration prepares for them.
"I also consider that this would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, who has the constitutional mandate for the management.
Replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and this results in better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Upgrading the change, he said, would be upgrading the benefits of digitalization, which involves a public-interest decision that has not only a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of an entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic governance of the State, encompasses a group of assignments that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded the sphere of competence of Congress in a way, as it ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws issued by the Legislative, he says.
The possibility of a "vote-by-vote" count in Michoacán is being analyzed
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,000 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote-by-vote" is a reality with regard to the election trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second thousand procbilies of the election of the same governors is only equal to the 6th and 27th seats of the governors.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llandaral Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonise local standards in the area of reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán did not approve either his Political Constitution, his Electoral Code of State or his Electoral Justice Act, at the same time that the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline, so that this electoral process could enter into force with God’s permission, and the Law of Electoral Justice.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the vote of the state official for constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because he does not have the right to impose "sanctions" or "sanctions".
Interviewed on the possibility of "voting by vote", María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal said that with the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the IEM General Council it will be possible to achieve partial and total counts of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting in the file of the urn is not found in the President of the urn; or there is no record of the minutes of the urn; or there are records of the urn.
In addition, the total number of votes received in all polls can be achieved when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate who won the respective election and the one who won the second place in the election is equal to or below the present sign of the first session of the party and that there is a percentage point of the first session of the party;
The total countdown of the election can also take place if at the end of the common countdown it turns out that the difference between the alleged candidate winning and that of the second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidates were excluded in the second case.
It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second places is only 0.16 percent, even without accounting for the votes of 129 out of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of driver Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a Mass of Requiem.
According to his family, the Lieutenant Colonel's last will was that his ashes be spread in the Sierra de Zapalinamé.
After receiving the tributes along with the other people who died in the accident, Bacio Cortés' family returned to the capital Coahuila on board a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest to them attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the Lieutenant Colonel’s ashes arrived at the vigil chapel on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends traveled.
At 5:30 p.m., he was paid tribute to the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former fellow tech bachelor’s and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was part when he was preparing for the bachelor’s degree.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and his ashes spread in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, he always said that 'he has his family and friends'," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the Lieutenant Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, she considers that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and cared for his family a lot."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to enroll at the Air College in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some couldn’t believe it, because they said he even had a truck problem; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he travelled to Zapopan for his parent’s graduation, for this he knows that his uncle is dying by doing what he loved most in life: piloting an aircraft.
His last goodbye
It was honoured to say goodbye to the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, a tribute given to Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, where Saltiogi, the Mexican Army, the Aegis, the Mexican Army, the Mexican Army, and the Zoxites, directly from the Si.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, alongside the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people, all officials of the service.
The remains of the pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 6:05 p.m. to be handed over by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the group's esplanade, where he was expected by his family, his mother-in-law, and others, his daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law Amanda.
Three abandoned bodies, located in Cadereyta NL property
A few hours before they were found, the military authority had presented before the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by shots fired in different parts of the body and with grace, in an abandoned property in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at the 1.5 kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who have passed through this place have observed that in the property, whose fence has beige and coffee color the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, about three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on his side was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
A meter away was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were on the stomach.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another location, as no claws were found in situ.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by an organized crime group towards the other, except for a few bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence made the presentation of 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to be related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to information published, in a first event on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and managed to save one who had been deprived of liberty.
They were confiscated three buildings and a cell phone; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another event that took place on November 12 at 6:00 p.m., military personnel made a surveillance tour in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without registration plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and conducting an inspection, the military found a long gun, a loader and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on November 13 at 2:00 p.m., one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are attributed to clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster
The appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the president of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire Eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, named Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form the Government.
A majority of technocrats are expected to present a cabinet, although it is not clear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
The “framework is now well drawn,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to levels that cannot be sustained.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package required by European leaders to regain confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Emphasizing the pressure on Monti to accelerate, market instability placed the yield of Italian BTP bonds 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: “We said we would support this government a lot.”
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, to which the crisis forced him to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, the secretary of the centre-right party, told the press.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the majority technocrat government that Monti formed.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by noting that a Monti bankruptcy would be a disaster.
Monti began its consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers’ groups and youth and women’s organizations on Monday.
He will finish his meeting tour on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief repeat at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.9 trillion, would be too much for the current financial defences of the Eurozone.
Monti said his government should continue until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the election advances.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should only be trained by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that reciprocal distrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spaniards is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 soccer players from Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 participants participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 convocated by the two countries for today’s friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the San José National Stadium.
While national and European champions, number one in FIFA's monthly rankings, have a wide list of inter-selection games of Class A, Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) against Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the Stars League and in powerful Premier League clubs of England, maintain intense activity in national league and cup championships and competitions in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all of this, add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have limited international experience to an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest record of the Spanish team is that of goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who on Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equalled the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 internationals.
Casillas will play against Tricolore today and they will set a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona’s brain steering wheel, in 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized by UEFA the previous week alongside the other Iberian team centennials, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the forward of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Ready for the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left-handed Júnior Díaz, with 48 attendances and the striker Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have surpassed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with fewer than 30 attendances, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still starting.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, said the group is ready to offer one of his best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true in this country.
This is what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, of Brazil, last week.
The group is on the South American wing of its two-decade-long celebration tour and on Sunday 20th will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will be present at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles group The X and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcription can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For its Costarian fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I have only spent the holidays once in Costa Rica; it is such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
This is why we are excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is some kind of devotion to the group, the fans live intensity in the previous days.
What is your message to your most ardent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to be spent until this concert.
Some people already say his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Is this adding a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we have offered over the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have offered two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we learned it, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you have offered huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never produced ourselves there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the directory.
What's that all about?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and we can perform more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, which is why it’s very difficult to choose which songs to perform each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played for a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us why we loved those songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve accomplished?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us had imagined that we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we’ve been doing it for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and being able to continue to make music together makes us very excited.
We love each other and we love creating music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world where we have always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this large group.
We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
This is surprising when a movement emerges from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it’s much weirder when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we attended a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to still be friends with them all and it’s an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that has emerged.
It’s also very strange that a group like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and that alone is much longer than many groups normally last.
Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive again, and secondly, we all care about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with everyone’s music and it couldn’t go any better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure we don’t spend too much time on tour because it’s easy to fall into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
If we don’t forget that people are there for music, it helps us to remember that we have to respect the music and what it brought, not to mention the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which is not really of interest to any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and in the beginning it was great.
We've been a band for almost three years and we haven't released a record before Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I was thinking of him, I always thought about another person, laughed about him and he was working on it.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and that's why you chose him for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we liked the most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very distracting.
Why do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
It is he who sings it and I believe he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are its influences?
There are so many...
Among the first ones I remember were Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge hanging despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that emerged at the same time and, if that's relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's a music that's worth listening and bands like Mudhoney do better than Mudhoney now.
At first, her music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
That’s interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe, that are called very dark songs, even though these may sound a bit positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply dark songs.
I think if you grow up and there’s trauma in your life and you lose to a parent or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music, and these songs probably represent this to me.
I also think that one can be happy too and even like that one can do with dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his feet, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from a variety of conditions, including language cancer for which he has been operated on four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, he probably said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
It was operated on four times tongue cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kilograms, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney calculations, hypertension and circulatory problems in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving the National Special Operations Directorate of Police since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squadron that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political ties
An official courthouse, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and bosses, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political themes in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the summit of a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial and community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be “proper for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations,” according to information published by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay’s rejection and the call for consultations with its European ambassador.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world’s strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to expedite the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international tax cooperation standards.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustache plumber moves to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young woman in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to stores around the world this month, was designed from the start to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without wearing glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopy without glasses should work,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, a specialty press officer at Nintendo in Spain, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this support", as hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows for a fast and smooth play.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang on to less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second round" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose between a real-time “aggressive D” or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the various challenges and “do not succumb to optical illusions.”
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also implies the character's return to a mobile console, which has not happened since 2005.
In these video games, Nintendo takes a look at the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists in the fact that the moustache plumber must go through danger-mined platforms to release Princess Peach.
Even if I’m a player I find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the case of Luigi “joyable”.
Colum gives his support to Portillo extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the U.S. conspiracy for the <0x24>70 million laundering.
Thus, the trial ends for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that demanded Portillo to judge it.
In a press conference, Colum stated that his decision was subject to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his term "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and had given way to all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colum has done implies an executive action after exhausting all judicial and constitutional courts to judge the former mandate for the period 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was absolute for diverting Q120 million funds to the Department of Defense when he was president, which was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Department of Public Affairs appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The balance sheet for the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
Added to this is the long centennial of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to make the balance in an event celebrated in a former Fabra i Coats industrial complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighbourhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping people who are poorly trained, without work, with problems of drug addiction or marginalized.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who have collaborated with the association over the past 25 years.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the election season, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and former Deputy Mayor and current Eco-Socialist Municipal Adviser Ricard Goma attended the event.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended in the large room of Fabra i Coats.
Mas claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is as well, but he added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The President gave Trinijove as an example to know how to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-partys, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday with no resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of 51 Rue Balmes lived has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they were occupying illegally and where they were organizing micro-festivals that despaired the neighbors, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
“From today onwards there will be access control,” the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building – the rest were inhabited – took the electrical installation and a portion of the water, besides painting the walls and leaving all sorts of residues, especially alcoholic beverage boxes.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass celebrations, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied, her business fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made him unfair, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreational premises had to respond to the neighbors' complaints about the noise, while according to the latter, the troubles were not caused by the guests of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants of the parties organized there, who were the most frequent and the most frequent ones.
The director of the disco explained that the troubles were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it was nine months ago that he "forgives" the rent.
The Urbana Guardia (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation.
Alberto Fernández Díaz, the chairman of the municipal group of the PP of the city hall, had called last week for “immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of common life and civicism that it caused residents and the degradation of the area.”
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all apartments and that in some apartments there were flights as well.
It is in this sense that he added that "one must end with impunity and be implacable against the antisocial behavior generated in property".
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police moved to number 35 of Rue Mont-ral, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the possibility of convocation beyond the controversy on fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this administration printed promotional posters from Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in numbers, with Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orient itself on the north-south axis, otherwise high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is in favour of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with slingshots in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall called for a mega-competition consisting of 16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola.
A door turns to the idea of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises on its own: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organisation and in terms of reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation for all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring theme of which two members of this former caste of electors speak when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, come together.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is appropriate.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate on "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the greenhouse pastures, was not carried out at the end.
"You have to start from the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for its high accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the architect gave the verdict for which the title of "Collserola doors" contains a "lexical trap": it is not to think of these "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers that derive from the "uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience lived in the 1980s and which had in the Forum area "the squirrel's song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the boundaries on which one can build.
“Limiting something means already establishing the next step,” that is, its overcoming.
“We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [referring to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can cause genuine disasters.”
With more focus on the question, Modol believes that, by simplifying, the slope of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, not".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "must not be missed", thanking the town hall for the opportunity it offers its corporation to intervene in this project "from the very first moment".
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the exception that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "doesn't know" if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success", he says) that one has to create: "We, the architects only, must be an instrument".
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that gives the title of this play is complex, because the basics of the contest lack an overall vision of Collserola: "We have summoned 16 cross-sectional contests - he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means that, at least in this case, he has chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can collide in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In its opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately above that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the Red Casino’s legal power foundation granted forgiveness to the Mayor’s brother for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After 72 years of detention, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released after the founding of the Red Casino legal power grants him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial for blackmail against the Mayor's brother of Monterrey.
After the Royal Casino attack, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded him to pay an economic fee for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the casino to operate clandestinely.
Following the public denouncement, the Public Prosecutor opened a criminal trial against the Mayor’s brother, PANiste, and on September 2, he was arrested and held in custody for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Officer of the Public Department 3 of Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
It remained there for the next 49 days when a second order of detention was issued to him after the Officer of the Public Prosecutor initiated the crimes of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Penal Center allegedly for making the owners of the Red Casino sing with a million and a half pesos; but he only spent a few hours in the middle-security detention center because there were death threats against him.
Authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the Registrar of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonas's guilt, such as that concerning the acquisition of his money of 1.5 million pesos, but after the investigation, there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonas's guilt.
On Monday, the founder of the Red Casino’s legal power, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, presented himself before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the Mayor’s brother of the region; he could therefore regain his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's Officer, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who of the gambling house's associates had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to disclose the name.
According to file 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is granted legal pardon and thereafter no complaints regarding the trial brought against him can be lodged; he will not be asked for any damages and no punishment either.
After hearing the foundation of the legal power of the gambling house, at 3:50 p.m. the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the San Nicolás de los Garza prison to inform Jonas that he had been legally pardoned and his file would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome reveals details of the aerial accident in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven others lost their lives
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) said the results highlighted in the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter crashed directly against the ground.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the poles had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it satisfies the requirements for transporting personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations conducted in the impact zone did not report the appearance of floor pieces.
“In a research study, it was reported that there were no parts or components of the aircraft elsewhere, the impact was presented in a structural way.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and satisfies the requirements to carry them.
The ground had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary has ensured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, General Manager of Airports and Auxiliary Services, ensured that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Helicopter was operating at cruising speed and this happened on a soft ascent ground.
"This information supports the assumption of a normal functioning cruise at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out in accordance with the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during flight and on the ground.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in the ICAO mentioned appropriate conditions for take-off, and as the aircraft progressed towards the adjacent zone between DF and the State of Mexico, there were low-altitude fog layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the fog conditions the crew sought a lower altitude area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the aircraft's latest radar recording coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has taken place on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The aircraft's residue dispersion model suggests that the helicopter has collided with the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No traces of fire or explosion have been detected:
In the location of the accident there is always no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9,200 feet above the average sea level, the ground presenting a slope that is from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful research in a larger area than the surrounding area, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the assumption that the impact took place under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the obesity gene
Social Security leads an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the obesity gene in children and adolescents, called the 'Obesity Genetic Protocol of Children and Teens' which will allow to have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the 20th Century National Medical Center’s Hospital of Specialties, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social assistants had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and undergraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation invites the people with or without the right to participate, to present themselves to the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the evidence for minors is carried out every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriental).
After reaching the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sportive Unidad Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sportive Unit Morelos (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the aim of this research and that e is to know the components and the importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in children and young Mexicans to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays all participants of the anthropometric measurements (weight, size, circumference of size), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics will be applied.
Cruz López noted that this research is the result of health professionals’ concern for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in just six years, there was a 77 percent increase in boys' obesity and 47 percent in girls' obesity; there was also a dramatic increase in overweight," the IMSS specialist said.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent of Indo-American inheritance, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the overall evaluation of children, which allows to detect whether they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
It even says that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood of suffering from metabolic disorders and even pre-diabetes.
The information is handled in a confidential manner, the doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, who are explained each of the measures and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the TV and using means of transportation instead of walking short distances.
Another reason is the high calorie intake, i.e. the largest intake of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - paste of meat with corn flour wrapped in leaves of corn -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high protocol content of fats and proteins.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid cassis
Rafael Herrera, researcher at UNAM’s Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better efficiency, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200,000 cassis each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who ensured that even if the process of construction and maintenance were reminiscent of the pavement.
During his conference A Technological Opinion on Cassis, organized in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory of which he is responsible develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with a higher temperament, but with a higher resistance to asphalt.
Herrera Nájera believed that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve performance, and therefore, the formation of cassis.
He explained that the asphalt, the heavier part of the oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the comterical co-veteral sound.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, of almost 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has a nearly solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes hot-watering.
This means that in the streets the asphalt resistance is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineering specialist warns.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City were mostly covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he reported, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass by generating effort, the latter allows the forces to propagate very well in the pavement.
If the asphalt had been modified, it would have spread better, according to the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he says, one puts a last layer called a rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, of sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the efforts, the bearing layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be treated.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil wets, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to exit, which softens all the layers of the pavement and thus causes cassis.
In the process of forming a cassis, he says, the first one that breaks down is the rolling film and only later is the asphalt layer affected, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with aqueous maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that vehicle loading is another important factor for the formation of cassis and therefore the thickness of each layer of pavement must always be related to vehicle loading and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent formation of cassis.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to research and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair cassis easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What's missing from Valle's candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that made Melina Ramírez Serna not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle received her title of 14th Princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the Miss Colombia crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to be on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new princess of Colombia.

Nowadays, the big question that many people ask themselves is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation demonstrated that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been voted in vain Queen of the Police and Best Jolie Face of Vogue, from the titles of Navarra's Navarra to the Misuroana, or from the titles obtained by the Colombian.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to designate her as First Princess is the fact that she did not convince her with her answer to the question "What was the book that marked you and why?" posed by Martín Murillo Gómez of Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer from the candidate of Valle to this question:
“I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it’s a way of culturalizing myself, I definitely believe that the book that marked my childhood is ‘The Little Prince’, it’s a pretty deep book.
Now I am reading "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
This answer was not liked firstly because of the term "cultured" and secondly, not to explain concretely how each book cited had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what has to happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a big book."
Among the assumptions made is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A Bogota journalist insinuated that being the favorite, the ovationist and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (the Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best handmade costume, and Queen Mother), "it awakened the jealousy of the other candidates," stressed the queen and it's not for that.
And this was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Even though the two parades seemed certain of her own, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for the "Como en casa" program on the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was named Princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most prizes during the contest does not receive the Queen's Crown."
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That’s why two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
"Just beauty is not enough for a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before the competition starts they are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of his flaws in his back and fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because the jury precisely elected him as the ‘Natural Beauty’ candidate with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queen preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledged that Melina didn't have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem of abdominal fibrosis, which in reality for me hadn't been too notorious, left her spots the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, from Cromos magazine, believes that Valle’s mistake was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
“Surgery is good, but Valle didn’t know how to do it.
Her body has never been her asset and she has lost because of this aspect."
For this prize, which the National Beauty Competition returns for the first time, after a cruel prediction emerged that happened last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo was making to Melina not to give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will pass through history as one of the queens who, despite her stunning passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Cali dactyloscopist has gone to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, a CTI dactyloscopist from Cali passed to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopists working in the CTI’s local offices, this week was the “availability” tour of Eliasar González, a Puerto Tejada man who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after taking appropriate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliasar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be the man leading the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the site of the corpse, he did not recognize him by his physical appearance, because he was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much leaner.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian loup, ink, a pickup and a lantern, Eliasar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those of the map.
His eye did not mislead him: he was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that he was the supreme leader of the Farc.
In search of the imprint
For a dactyloscopist from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González at a press conference for the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know our job.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, dactyloscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals have fake IDs or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher said that in a case of theft he had to remove part of the wall of a house, because in this place the thief had pressed his hand to get out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to take a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint from all hands and identify the offender who had participated in different flights,” he recalls.
Fingerprints can also distract or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently, a dead man was found, with bottles of drink around him.
By way of the investigation, it was determined that a parent may be suspected of the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee that he's the killer, it's the place on the scene.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that “the fingerprints of objects are extracted with chemical or physical reagents.”
When they appear, a pick-up machine or tape is used to pick them up.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the delinquents' database, or to the National Civil Registry.
“The problem is that there are still a lot of Colombians without papers,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Like everything that shines is not gold, everything you touch does not necessarily become a fingerprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is realized.
The ‘indigned’ challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were camping in front of Zuccotti Square.
A large part of the people had access to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement on Tuesday challenged New York authorities by trying to re-enter, thanks to a court order, Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters were mobbing in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allowed the 'indignated' to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the response of the "indigned" to the evacuation of their camp, personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, has reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to restart the camp.
In addition, the 'indigned' occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue power stations, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, property of the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some protesters, even though Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists to whom he had also passed handcuffs.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who have settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the members of the movement and tried to intervene in their favor before the Police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a private-owned premises - remains closed pending the celebration of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analyzed.
Some displaced protesters carried and distributed copies of the court order at that time and even delivered it to officers who were monitoring the square, which caused "some minor clashes," Bray said, who denounced the fact that some officials hit the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating Occupy Wall Street members or applying 'laws published after the start of the occupation or prohibiting protesters from re-accessing the park with tents or other properties they used before'.
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the protesters, but warned that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn at Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided because the protesters "violated the law".
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the square because it became "a place where people didn't come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to hurt other people," because "some stores had received threats" and residents "were afraid of the quality of their lives."
"The evacuation this morning at dawn has been repugnant and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests of U.S. workers than they are," the movement's spokesman said, accusing the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression."
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they do not plan to organise "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be featured on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescuer in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program from Canadian television.
CTV's private television channel announced today that Anderson, along with the "crowner" Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December with a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide-ranging online broadcast of a private porn video in which she appeared with her husband at the time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, who appeared dressed in a dress as a Mariette in the Virgin Mary.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently featured a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV’s Christmas special program also features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who himself is not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian a “put” during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Resurfaces After Earthquake
GDP rises by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends downward spiral in early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, convalescent even after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in Japan since World War II.
The first estimates by the Government of Tokyo calculated material losses at <0x24>300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of decline, data from the Gross Domestic Product between July and September were used to turn the page definitively: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% at an annualised rate.
The one recorded in the second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - furthermore, it assumes the highest rate of growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of acquisitions of equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate – or rebuild – infrastructure, use shortages to grow from zero.
Japan has emerged mainly due to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo re-entered the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refugee values" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and U.S. forecast disturbances, a privilege that weighs as a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger dividend, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reversal for a country whose line of economic float is determined by the health of large tech groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their low earnings between July and September the yen quotation.
As markets continue to operate in the EU's peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not lower guards.
“We need to monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that the majority of member countries presented clearer signals of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are being slowed down.
For the latter dropped four decimal places to 10.4 points, compared to 10.8 in August.
The eurozone has even been below the average, which is at level 100, n down eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens again fuels doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to sink into the labyrinth leading to the outbreak of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is rather imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, said yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days set out in his appointment will be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, demanded that the new measure be taken, and he did not re-establish it.
“The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit,” Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a confidence vote for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the Code of Discipline for Officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not raise any doubts about his position: “We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more.”
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse than the EU and the IMF, the agencies that must unlock the <0x24>8 billion Athens urgently needs, and said clearly that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still annoyed by the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the Troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, even if there is no longer a definite date.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen underlines Spain’s “preponderant” place in this type of finance
Spain "has reached a global preponderance in the role of Micro-finances".
Queen Sophia recalled that in the past two decades the country has become the world’s second donor in terms of this cooperation instrument whose “essence” resides in the fact that it is an “instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for humanity, under-humanity.”
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations for 2015, and, "with a fixed day of people, with a fixed amount of people as the goal, in which it has been rebuilt."
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility," Queen Sofía said, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating during the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, will "guarantee better benefits for women and the creation of new skills".
We have “achieved a lot of goals” and “we face a lot of challenges.”
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a debate forum, but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" should be pushed.
Thus, His Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that 100 million of these families are out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The impulse in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she knew 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution," said His Majesty's family, whose "relationship with this World Summit in Washington and other meetings, which gave him the opportunity to re-evalidate the project.
Finally, Queen Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging people present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this regard, she stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered microcredit to be a "serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" developed countries' governments must work under solidarity criteria and not allow it to be the victim of compression.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the “success” of giving “trust” to people “excluding those to whom everyone closes the door”; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that “opens its doors.”
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also President of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned for the programme, but it was imposed in the autumn, especially to satisfy the activists who consider the government's policy to be too lax today and perhaps to the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Management Board, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they were entitled, following their interventions, Angela Merkel and, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The chancellor's master idea - and the motion - holds a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs directly depend on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the EU's control over the fiscal policies of euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission in a universal suffrage "in order to give Europe a face".
This is in any case one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Indeed, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Sept will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile there and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is as well.
But the jalon is laid.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country on the board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which, of course, reinforced the weight of Germany.
Looking to calm the climate within her party, the chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But she has also not sought to win her congress on the back of European "small" countries or countries in difficulty promptly criticizing Germany's arrogantness.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in holes.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does it mean to cheat on sick leave?
After the allocations, the UMP and the government launch the disease arrest offensive.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family allowance box, and to give a speech on the theme - repeated since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and the assistant.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a willingness to make savings in a context of rigor, but is no less an announcer of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on disease arrests.
First of all, with a budgetary savings goal: the government plans to impose a fourth day of deficiency on private employees before taking a job break.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of salary, at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could stir up anger, but that would allow for a report of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>280 million, according to Les Echos.
And which would be accompanied by another measure, of a more symbolic scope: to impose on officials an uncompensed day of deficiency in case of discontinuation of work (they have so far no deficiency period, versus three days in the private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also relaunches the fraud theme, targeting this time the abuses related to work stops.
"Controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will be reimbursed," Xavier Bertrand told RTL's microphone on Sunday, November 13.
As with other cases, the advertising effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraud at work stops.
It has been the subject of constant follow-up and political offensives since 2002, which have most often brought their fruit.
The French are not sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
First, let’s focus on national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% were for maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% were for sick leave, or <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
That’s 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French suffered an average of 14.5 days of unemployment, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides certain discrepancies: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any sick leave.
Another study, this time from Health Insurance, specifies that in 2010, 37% of sickness breaks were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When comparing them to their European neighbours, French employees are no more inclined to work stops than elsewhere.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) in France ranged from 10% to 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Disease-stop fraud represents very little in the face of work in the dark.
As for fraud, it only reaches a small scale.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on sickness arrests for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In cases of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, 11% of cases were "unsuited or unjustified" out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
A total of 169,000 “unjustified” cases, out of several million employees who have had a sick leave.
A figure that is very little compared, for example, to that of work in the dark.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would account for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 to 15 billion in tax revenues per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece will need to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to revive its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said on Monday before Parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his government of union would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To continue the economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the head of government, who gave his first public address at the opening of the debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday.
Implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27 will be the “primary task” of the new government, as the country’s participation in the eurozone “is at stake”, he added.
Accordingly, Papadémos predicted that the country’s public deficit will be reduced “around 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Left rejects new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday backed measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the targets of deficit and debt reduction, and the fight against waste, but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
At Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without written guarantee from all parties that they would support the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras responded that his exertion would suffice and sign
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements for that.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this choice is required, with a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death.”
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire most Canadians have to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, it is in Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86% of the deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said it wants nothing to change in the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on incompetent or inconsistent persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, said yesterday in a teleconference that more cases of these overflows would be found precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Eighty-five percent of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are of less value.
As for people who have committed assisted suicide, the respondents believe at 41% that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or discontinuing care with a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to comply with a life-long refusal of care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee calls for it to be considered when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already made reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the position of the experts signatories to the report "extreme", among other things, because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the terminal phase.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 could ask for help to commit suicide,” said Me Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Me Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But, “in society, he says, there are tags and constraints.”
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she called a "pro-Euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular contests data from the report on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan King Calls President Assad to Leave Power
Ladies denounce a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Bashar al-Assad’s supporters protested in front of the Foreign Ministry’s premises yesterday.
Diplomatic pressures on Bashar al-Assad’s Syria, which, with Russia’s support, resisted them and denounced a “conspiracy” against the country, were intensified yesterday.
Two days after Syria’s suspension by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and neighboring Syria Jordan have taken a position in favour of President Assad’s departure.
Jordan’s King Abdallah II was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “take power” in Syria, where some 40 civilians and regime forces were still killed.
“If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life,” Jordan’s neighboring country, the king, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have been a failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country for which Turkey is adopting an increasingly tough line.
The United States, for its part, congratulated itself on a “strengthening consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime’s actions” following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have died in the Deraa region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians were killed "at heavy machine gun sweeps in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a news conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was "going towards the end of the crisis".
He also reacted vigorously to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said was “a dangerous step.”
Syria "doesn't bleed," he added, ensuring that "the Urid plots against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a “civil protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he believes is confined to "paranoia".
A new special meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the emergency exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of armed forces from cities prone to protest and the release of detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday said the Arab League’s decision was “incorrect” while China urged Syria to implement the crisis outsourcing plan, while maintaining its support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy, Italy
Monti demands time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has demanded some time from the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifice", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in talks with the political parties yesterday before meeting the unions and the patronage today.
It should set up a relatively narrow cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti talked about an important program with a lot of sacrifices," Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups engaged in the talks, said after meeting the president of the appointed council.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said he expects Mario Monti to call for a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list of perhaps a dozen ministers to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets, asking them for time.
In “democracy, there are specific deadlines” to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying he was “certain that markets will be patient and understandable.”
His appointment by the president had been initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern has taken over, especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed prime minister should form a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislative session, he said.
According to House Speaker Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti, once in office, has committed himself to working in the urgency and in order to make Italy "re-protector" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary equilibrium target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further rigorous measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, the “patron of the bosses” in Italy, who will see him on Tuesday, also stressed the need to relaunch the economy, “because a country that has no growth can’t meet the deficit parameters”.
Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy is expected to place <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 billion in government bonds by April 2012.
A Russian Scientist Helped Iran's Nuclear Program
A Russian scientist, Vychev Danilenko, helped Iran develop a usable detonator with a nuclear weapon, a U.S. NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA expressed its "serious concerns" over a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program last week.
According to ISIS, largely in IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet nuclear military center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then co-operated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions "strong indications that Iran's development of a nuclear detonation system" "was assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a member state informed the Agency, worked during the militia program of its main source of this technology in its country."
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes Increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or slightly, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49%, compared to a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews, and a 14% increase in crimes against Jews.
The total number of “hate crimes” rose slightly to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," Human Rights First said, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be seen as a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, a spokesman for the organization.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,” he said, adding that this could lead to improved police reports on “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of civil rights struggle.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter on Monday introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service a bit more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to track more readable, live activity of other "Twitters", users who follow messages ("tweets"), and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested “on a small percentage of users in August” before being broadcast across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinct functioning, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to retransmit someone else’s message, <0x23>followfriday to recommend following another user) making the initiate’s happiness, thus opens up to a wider audience with a larger handling more similar to Facebook<0x2B> and the audience’s network.
On the network, users were suddenly debating "tweets" about the interest of this innovation.
“It’s useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 wrote.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed," <0x40>dannykronstrom said.
Austrian
Registration of a budgetary "gold rule" in the Constitution
The government of a large Social Democratic/Christian coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a budgetary "gold rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid possible degradation by the sovereign rating agencies (A).
It is the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, while Austria's public debt is 74.6%, far above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but far below or below the country's debts.
“If Austria’s solvency was reduced by just one crane, from AAA to AA<0x2B>, we should pay an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion in interest each year,” said Deputy Chancellor and Christian Democrat Minister for Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindegger.
Austria thus follows a request from the eurozone member countries from the summit in Brussels on 26 October last: the heads of state and government had then requested the registration by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the same constitution or in a constitution.
The system adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the "German model", with Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rules".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the federal government's structural public deficit will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and municipalities will have to present the budget to the public.
The aim is to bring the public debt to the horizon 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen Fort
Noda threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen should continue to rise.
“We will intervene as we did the last time if we find excessive volatility” in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen went up not far from the historical levels that prompted Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yenes for dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just set a new record of validity since 1945 against the green card.
But the yen has been regularly up since, doped by purchases by investors who consider it a “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro was more than 160 yen.
This flare of Japanese currency is detrimental to archipelago exports as it lowers the cost of products Made in Japan and reduces the value of foreign revenues by Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northeastern region of Tohoku, Noda said, fearing that this re-entry of the yen will kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The world’s third-largest economic power relaunched growth in the third quarter – 1.5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of households plunged by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister said the price of the yen did not reflect "Japan's economic fundamentals".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", making it clear that no further monetary softening was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the issuing institution increased its Treasury bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion) to 55,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion) the amounts of loans that it dedicates to the purchase of various financial securities.
Eurozone:
The rates are rising, the stock exchanges are flanking
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of fragile countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European stock exchanges are getting a little more into negative territory this Tuesday, 15 November.
At 10 a.m. in Paris, CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt yields 0.4% and London 0.1%.
“With the new tensions on the yields of euro area countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make part of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are just too aware of the risk of contagion,” Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7%, suffering in turn from renewed concerns from market players about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and the exchanges will continue in a narrow corridor of variations as long as investors have no evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concerns about the future of the euro area is penalizing the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has evolved at its lowest level in a month and a half.
Around 10:00, the European currency is worth <0x24>1.3570, in response to 0.4%.
She retreated after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, met in congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing for, among other things, the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates well beyond 6%
The borrowing rates in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian bonds at 10 years reached 6.85%, that of Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over interest rates in the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of the stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has demanded time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxia by the weight of his debt.
Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 would be the “primary task” of his government.
Spain is at the forefront of the market, while the country's parliamentary elections are held on Sunday.
The rate gap ("spread") between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historic high.
In anticipation of the growth figures in the euro area
In terms of statistics, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, driven by household consumption.
Insee, however, revised downwards the second quarter figure, with a 0.1% decline in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
And it’s really the fourth one that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must overcome the dogmas.
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is safe for an election meeting to be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and rather than on the nuclear issue.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic evolution will result in a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources will need to be paused to continue to produce electricity permanently, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate deregulation, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is neither the case with Belgium, which submits itself to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor with Switzerland, which just intends to build only state-of-the-art power plants.
Conversely, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name a few, pursue their projects with determination.
The U.S., they, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, which focuses on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts speech.
The choice of Berlin will result in a tightening of the price of electricity, an energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, in particular from Russia, a bond of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
Within a few months, all these angry effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated.
Champion of Europe wind, of which it draws 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to wind intermittentness; according to which, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay for an electricity bill that is 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key competitive factor and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear power would result in a sharp increase in electricity prices, which would make illusory the beautiful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of Frenchmen refuse to pay, especially since they do not manifest opposition in principle to this energy, polls show.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has enabled the construction of an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410.000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it trains a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and makes them highly job-creating and non-displaceable.
If France had just decided to leave nuclear power, it would be sacrificing many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros per year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services as a source of grief.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years while its manufacturer’s decline would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miracle electricity production, no more than there is no diabolic.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear, maintaining the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
We have a security authority in France that exerts an intransigent and transparent control over existing power plants as well as the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident is the result of two unprecedented natural disasters that have killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw the lessons from this accident, as it did for the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the security authorities, the operators and the French and German manufacturers, the EPR has a design that makes it able to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians eager to build a power plant, the stopping of its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers to dominate such a decisive debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the supply of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "land of human rights" of France.
More recently, it was the administrative harassment of foreign students that made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Libération of 23 May) proclaiming in the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant servants".
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a fairly wide consensus on this subject between left and right.
To the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and to the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can not welcome all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared to the left as well as to the right.
For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be hard to give to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande chanted banalities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a charge, a problem, may be paying electronically; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press's economics on the migratory, 352 pp.), it exists in the countries that have a large share of migratory and migratory knowledge.
Restricting immigration anaemias growth and nightmares to employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are at risk of replacing national workers, especially the under-skilled, by exercising downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national workers, exercising for the most part trades in sectors of employment shortages.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the job offer.
Positive impact on salaries
In the same way that a surgeon will have trouble working in a country that has a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that an increase of 1% in migration flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real long-term wages.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, with an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will contribute a net (less-expenditure) contribution of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to the public budgets on average over the course of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to search for the missing growth points "with his teeth".
The teeth in question, used to dissuade immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think of European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonies.
Some have been able to believe that it would be enough for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way possible.
It is known, since Napoleon the Little, that this was an ease of thinking.
The universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become a "instrument of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of power, an education, a light, economic and social solidarity, a justice.
The crisis of Europe we are living in is an economic crisis, but it is just as much a crisis of politics and democracy.
The pallinody of the true-false Greek referendum will have had in this respect a double-revealer value: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought out to be overcome.
The truth is that the frontlines of the democratic struggle have moved today, and that for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer drawing in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to the needs and in dispersed order.
A white-seing to the absolute European monarch or a leap on foot in the void of the nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cuts, but an exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level, common, full right, serene and continuous.
There are no crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal - nowhere else to stop the listing - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bent on the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to the people's sovereignty the pilotage of the European project.
For together, Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The outbreak of the crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except, of course, to lead us to disaster.
After long struggles with this proposal by the Socialists and by Jacques Delors, everyone today demands the European economic government.
Yeah, either.
But to think of it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new step in European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to “do” the Republicans.
The Revolution in the Interests could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe politically, a true European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
"Contactless" chip cards are spreading
The World Chip Show opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
In fact, the year 2011 is expected to end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (debit card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart.
The most supportive segment is contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or to settle your purchases by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to continue to progress in 2012 (580 million expected units) and account for nearly 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Long after the Asia-Pacific region, Europe has gained ground for contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double mouthpieces.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To get to the top speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
“Two major French institutions have committed to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is essential for making transactions.
"They took the delay".
“But they should finally see a real growth next year.”
“We are counting on sales of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the general company, too, said yesterday it was preparing to market an offer allowing its customers to pay contactlessly with their mobile phones.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front expands
Paris is concerned about links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-time suspects, links between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Alger has now “acquired certainty”.
"The way both organizations operate and the intelligence services reports show that there is good cooperation," he said without further clarification.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January last year would have opened the doorways.
Kidnapped at a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the aftermath of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Axis terrorist
The analysis of past calls is oriented towards several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has stayed long in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
“It’s an advance, but there’s no doubt more formal evidence to expect before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect has received external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these “supports” had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices and the same bill as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore pressured Abuja to take account of the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of uninteresting illuminated people.
A quick success.
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist faith Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has achieved rapid success.
She politicizes herself and demands strict respect for the Sharia as her militants engage in the struggle against the wicked central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active, multiplying the attacks on the police stations.
Abuja’s reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invaded the city, with 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was arrested alive, was killed in prison.
Hence the sect will radicalize and leave its fiefs from the north.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram took it to the police's secure QG during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would navigate from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi has invested in Mali and Niger, which al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was “ready to share all the information.”
The World According to Republican Candidates to the Presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, or even simplistic ideas?
To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied the tone-inspiring statements and abbreviations in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unfounded - were.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the nomination race for the “Grand Old Party”, threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and question them “for manipulating their currency,” a bearer theme in an America hampered by the migration of whole pans from its industry to Asia.
So much worse if this must involve the triggering of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has barely strayed from an attitude that “flats” emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains unheard of.
In the image of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop his nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows an embarrassing misunderstanding of the records.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop a nuclear capability” – apparently ignorant of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texan governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants attacks on Iran, says he is ready to engage the US military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president replicate that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his anti-terrorism wine.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of Iraq's "boys", on his tergiversations in Libya, thus sticking a low label to him.
But the attack isn't that easy.
The population considers Obama’s national security balance to be rather positive, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, it has mistrusted military interventions that lead to the collapse.
And, arguing that it is necessary to economically rebuild America to revive its leadership, Obama strikes more just.
The Nord Stream, the new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe to Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has come into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brilliance.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffet, last Tuesday, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that directly connects, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned together the steering wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive in Western Europe each year by a first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline is to be completed by the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And the possibility of building a third one on the same route is already mentioned.
For Gazprom, the timely and timely completion of this huge yard has the airs of victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose a bit of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to block it from accessing the Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the North Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the Hitler-Stalin alliance to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by providing its support to this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies there.
But this is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has managed to triumph over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily gas consumers, and whose landfills are declining.
“This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically,” Fillon confirmed, inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating how political and economically important gas contracts are.
All this explains the wide smiles displayed by the Gazprom leaders, in number in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is made of reinforced concrete steel to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average.
To build it, mining fields dating from World War II had to be avoided.
“A hundred have been removed or destroyed, by caution,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to multiply the measures to protect wildlife and flora.
The tube is a long metal serpent, as heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which does not interrupt on its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers resigned while the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state-owned company set up permanently off their coasts.
“In the event of a mishap, we stop the passage of gas in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the pipeline thus escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who planned the welding to see a leak every 100,000 years.
The state of the pipeline is monitored by a submarine robot, driven by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus circulating inside the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is introduced into the tube, wide by a meter of diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second, he provides accurate information about possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo any repairs.
The flow of the gas is simply ensured by the pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 at the arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have set up a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company, for 20 years renewable, all of its gas transport capacities.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was ensured by 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their expenses, as only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The Baltic gas pipeline emerges in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificity of the gas that arrives before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to return the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine booklet is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elasticity, its leaves of a broken white color, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin (skin) which designates a varnish cotton used to cover banquets, for example.
This type of book was very popular with writers and travelers.
“Moleskine brought to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has been the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
The success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million currencies.
We are far from the confidential production of the early years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a buyer's portrait-robot, as the notebook seduces both the businessman and the student and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, now has nearly 100 and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her bookshops in bookstores, from the Fnac to small downtown shops, and has been able to impose her identity.
“We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition " Detour " where architects or artists exhibit their own booklet.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover for the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer covers... The brand boasts a wide range of supports.
A success that made envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was redeemed by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of workers with disabilities so high?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of people with disabilities opens today.
Despite a voluntary public policy set up in 2005, the unemployment rate of people with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the whole population.
Discouragement?
"No," said Eric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people.
"The progress that has been made over the past fifteen years is considerable."
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher.”
"However, there is still a lot to do."
It must be said that for the disabled unemployed, there are still many obstacles to accessing employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the baccalaureate and of the 2.3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In short, there are so many criteria that complicate the return to employment, and that "are the nucleus of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
This is for the target brakes.
The non-deed remains, the mentalities that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité indicated that the managers surveyed had "a low level of knowledge of disability," with "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual disabilities."
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment target of 6 per cent of disabled workers, set in a 1987 law.
The latest known figures, dating back to 2008, report a ratio of 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of " taxed " institutions, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also translates into real awareness, especially in large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What Happiness"
Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of this friendly match before they faced the Blues Tuesday night.
We will not go until we write that there was connivence between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the staircase of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have made peace.
Five months after his attacker’s mood move against Turkey, the Belgian national team has only praise for him.
“I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian.”
"I want to go ahead," assures the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his performances in the club and in the selection, "it's a whole, he justifies."
"In Lille, I'm there all year round, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Honoured against Romania on Friday evening for this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brillie".
Without, however, omitting the notion of “pleasure”.
Les Bleus has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been supportive,” he says.
Obviously, this contributes to further strengthening the "special" character of this meeting.
"There is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he replies.
"We've crossed on time."
“To be able to play against them is just happiness!”
With bonhomie, Leekens has for his part evoked the "offering".
"Proud" to compete "a gala match".
"Proud" also to see -as a "voisin" - that France has "returned to a very high-level team" a little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
“Laurent Blanc did a work of thunder,” he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be happy to share the plane with the Blues heading... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgian people are getting big," he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You will find out in the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Paulo Bento’s Portugal starts with a lot of optimism his dam back against Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the end, the two teams had lacked realism.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt that the Selectçao, which he has been on the bench since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
In fact, Portugal is only 90 minutes from happiness.
But there’s a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to unleash.
In view of the game going (0-0), on Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the games are not done.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but it was unable to score this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, but it's a certain risk because we haven't scored a goal outside."
But at their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as boiling, even if the party obviously announces itself “very tight”, says an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take over," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The zero reported on Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
No one can be enough for Bosnians, who also need to mark.
"It's a good result, but it's a certain risk because we haven't scored a goal outside," Bento regrets.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and that has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As with Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put as much pressure on the Bosnians as possible so as not to “give them time to think.”
A good idea, provided you are realistic, this time.
