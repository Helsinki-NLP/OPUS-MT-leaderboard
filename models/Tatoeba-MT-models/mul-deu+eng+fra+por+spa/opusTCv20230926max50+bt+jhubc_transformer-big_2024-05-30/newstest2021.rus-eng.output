Semillar vs. the prosecutor's office: the cassation of the former deputy mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that the decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarski’s claim, but in April his case appeal was accepted by the State Court.
On December 12, 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its permission does not fall within his jurisdiction of the administrative court.
The court's decision stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damages caused during criminal proceedings.
“The prosecutor’s office and the exit court should regulate such matters,” ERR’s Tartu court press secretary Anette Kreitsmann told reporters.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision in the district court, which did not change the court’s decision of first instance on 5 February.
Now the judge will have to say his word.
According to Semilarski’s lawyer, Oliver Nyaes’s jury, his client has been suspected of robbery for about two years.
He now demands that the prosecutor’s office reject false allegations at his address and reimburse him for moral damages.
The reason for the complaint to the court was the statements of the Prosecutor for Special Cases of the Leuna County Prosecutor's Office Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski along with another at the time of the detention of the deputy mayor of Tartu Artem Suvorov was detained on suspicion.
“Remember that when I was arrested, the security police and the prosecutor’s office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of the Tartu – one of the most influential authorities of the local authorities – are being sold.
These airborne public suspicions have been accompanying me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor’s office doesn’t want to say anything about it,” Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nias, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor's office is to act.
“Affirmation of bribes and scams turned out to be false, but that’s not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia and Lithuania that at the stage of the investigation the representatives of the state should be cautious when choosing words so that the suspects would not be represented as criminals before the verdict.
The prosecutor’s office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, has not been observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” Nias said.
"The public perception of Semilarski as a serious offender and a predator in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of pretense are still being clarified is unacceptable, which contradicts the presumption of innocence," he said.
According to rus.err.ee, the former deputy mayor Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be brought to trial on charges of bribery - the criminal case initiated against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is tried on charges of deliberate violation of anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions of particularly large size.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in meetings of the city council in making decisions related to the companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of which Semilarski actively communicated in person.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to refrain from participating in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor’s office has alleged Semillarsky to have received a bribe and violated anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions of particularly large sizes.
This happened in October 2016, when he was arrested together with another deputy mayor Artem Suvorov (Central Party).
At the time, the prosecutor’s office and the security police said there was strong evidence against both deputy mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov’s case later came to the court, which fully justified the policy.
The prosecution of Valvo Semilarski is still pending.

How the CB’s decision to lower the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to lower the key rate again.
It fell by another 0.25 percentage point, to 4.25% of the annual – formally another historical minimum.
Considering the return of the short step of the rate reduction, as well as the tonality of the CB’s statements and updated forecasts on the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic outlook more optimistic than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy mitigation may soon stop.
“We have continued to mitigate monetary policy, primarily given that the risk of inflation deviation remains down from 4% in 2021,” said Elvira Nabiullina, head of the Bank of Russia.
They are linked to a significant decline in economic activity, a decline in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the removal of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes have revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand have been restored, construction and production of consumer goods have been expanded, the annual rate of reduction in freight traffic has been slowed.
According to the CB’s forecast, in 2020 the economy will decline to 4.5-5.5% (previously expected 4-6%), and the economic recovery growth in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, and in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the annual oil price forecast to <0x24>38 and <0x24>40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the CB expected <0x24>27 and <0x24>35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia’s inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously anticipated 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia’s view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the cycle of mitigation, economists in Russia and the CIS “Renaissance Capital” Sophia Donetsk and Andrey Melashchenko believe.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has consistently lowered its key rate for more than a year, and since the beginning of last summer it has fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the ECB lowered it immediately by one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the pandemic’s slowdown and associated economic constraints.
The chances of monetary policy adjustment remain (at the next meeting on 18 September and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, according to chief analyst of Rosbank Evgeny Koshelev.
The aggregate of pro-inflation risks also indicates the closeness of the interest rate policy pause – disrupted supply chains, a possible cost increase due to epidemic prevention measures and a faster (as opposed to expectations) recovery in demand, he says.

They can also fall to 4% if the central bank lowers the key rate in the fall, says Pokatovich.

The head of the region Igor Kobzev met with the mayors of Ust-Ordinsky Buryatsky District
During the workshop, which took place today, 24 July, the Government of the Irkutsk region discussed the main directions of the development of remote agricultural areas.
During the work trips to the districts of Ust-Ordninsky Buryatsky District, the head of the region gave a number of orders.
Today the mayors reported on their performance.
First of all, the construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orda was resumed.
An order for this facility was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now has the situation moved from a dead point.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
The deadline for construction is 2022.
And already this year should be put into operation a school in the village of Baiyandai.
The finishing of the premises has been completed.
Of the remaining works - the restoration of the territory.
In general, the programme for the construction of pre-school and secondary education facilities is of particular importance to the region.
For your county, in particular.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all the conditions for the education and recreation of children of all ages, - said Igor Kobzev, Governor of Irkutsk region.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively participate in the development of gene plans for settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the complex development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a general plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially important facilities, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage facilities, - stressed the head of the region.
The problem was also raised during the interview with a 30% reduction in milk intake by cooperatives.
This was due to the redistribution of the milk-processing company in favor of peasant farms.
As a result, the share of production in the cooperatives decreased.
The head of the region instructed the responsibilities of the Minister of Agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of the implementation of milk, analyze the experience of other territories and identify options for solving the problem.

The authorities of the sub-Moscow told about the fate of the shutdowns
In Sub-Moscow, the polygons of solid household waste continue to be closed.
This year, the government has promised to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are being upgraded to modern waste-processing complexes.
But such an option is not possible for every polygon - many of them have grown with dense housing construction.
After the polygon is closed, it rises to re-cultivation - the body of the polygon is resurfaced with the ground, degassing systems and filtrate discharge are mounted.
This allows to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill so that it does not ignite, does not cause debris, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains to rise a useless heap among the perpetrators of its residential construction.
Why don't we make it something useful?
For example, in Roosevelt, where the recultivation of the polygon "Annino" literally ended in the days, the authorities are considering the option to make a ski slope from a pile.
This polygon, which operated from 1976 to 2016, grew so that it went beyond the boundaries of the land allocated under it.
Therefore, during the recruitment, it was necessary to redeem the neighbouring areas, de facto already long filled with garbage under bond.
"Sometimes it will pass, the polygon will "acquire", the fortress will be gathered, and we will think what we can do to begin to benefit.
Directly in the eye - a ski resort," - told reporters the head of Ruzsky District Nikolai Parfenov.
Two polygons will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources
The "Torbeevo" polygons in Lubertz and "Timohovo" in Bogorodsky district will become sites for the production of renewable energy from fossil and biological gases.
In the territory of "Torbeev" by the end of the year will be launched a gas station, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy, which will provide the own needs of the polygon - thermal supply and thermal administration.
“Timohovo” will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
And on the Balashiki polygon "Kuchino", which was closed after complaints of residents on the "Line Direct" with the president of the country, can be created a museum.
"It was such an idea - to create a museum for the recultivation of the polygons of Podmoskiv," - said the government's prime minister - Minister of Environment and Environmental Management of the region Dmitry Kurakin.
Israel reports crash of drone in southern Lebanon <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
An unmanned Israeli military aircraft crashed in southern Lebanon.
The armed forces reported that he collapsed "in the course of operational activity".

There is no risk of leakage of information,” the Israeli army said on Twitter.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah promised not to leave unanswered the loss of any of his "brothers".
More on the situation - in the material "<0xD0><0x95>" "Israel is waiting for revenge of Hezbollah".
Furgal's alternate came to the protesters for the first time.
The cry of the governor of the Khabarovsk region, Mikhail Degtyarev, went to the participants for the first time since his appointment in support of the arrested former head of the region Sergei Furgal.
The broadcast of the meeting took place on his Instagram page.
"Moscow hears everyone, so I sent you a complaint so that the region does not crash without power... About Furgal I repeat: he "a" - my comrade, "b" - a single party, "c" - I am very concerned about his fate, the party is asking him to help him, he is delivering the product to him.
According to Degtyarev, now the Khabarovsk region cannot be left without a leader, so he was appointed to the post of the head of the region by decree of President Vladimir Putin, so that "a wonderful building (the government of the region) functioned, everything worked, the budget was spent on the needy".
The governor’s lie explained that he did not go to the protesters earlier because he could not communicate with thousands of protesters.
Therefore, he broadcasts on social media and reads all the comments about them.
On July 25, two consecutive protests took place in Khabarovsk.
The rally in support of the former governor has been taking place in the region since July 11.
On the eve of another action, Mikhail Degtyarev said he would leave the city on the day of the rally.
His courtship was stopped by protesters and called for a statement on the fate of the arrested ex-governor Furgal.
Degtyarov previously refused to go to the shareholders.
“There’s something to do with the manager, instead of going out and communicating with those who are yelling at the windows,” the governor said.

Beautiful tall minarets only decorated Ayia-Sophia
Once again about Aya-Sofia - the text of Vladimir Zelinsky, which, I say, must be protested.
First of all, there was free entry - hurrah!
I wasn’t in Istanbul, but it’s better to enter the House of God free than pay.
Secondly, the Muslims have just as honestly conquered this land as the Orthodox have conquered the Volgo-Oksk region, the Muslim Caucasus (and put a church in Grozny) and planted apples on Mars.
God help me!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
We're gonna get everyone back?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will demand to return their chapel, in the place of which the Ten Church?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved this building, invested funds in it.
That is, it belongs to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenclatures - as well as the plants and estates which the Leninians have taken from the bourgeois to their property.
They’ve improved everything from the Kremlin to Angara, so it’s all their progressors right.
Beautiful high minarets very decorated Ayia-Sophia, very.
It was a silly ink, it became a silly ink with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" and "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hanjis that unite faith and hypocrisy.
The believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
This is the thinking of British Foreign Minister Toynbee, who is ashamed to think so.
And the believer is everywhere a place of prayer.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave – he goes to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We're cobblers, not rocks.

Degtyarev surprised information about the purchase of gas "Sakhalin-1" for the dollar
Interim Governor of the Khabarovsk region Mikhail Degtyarev on Sunday, July 26, during a meeting with residents of Soviet Havana was surprised that the region was buying Sakhalin gas from the American company Exxon Neftegas for dollars.
U.S. gas is contracted in dollars until 2025.
“To be honest, I didn’t know that, and I’m in such a nudge because of this information.
I had no idea that this was still possible in 2020 in Russia,” RIA Novosti quoted him as saying.
Degtyarev noted that this issue was discussed with the head of the Russian Ministry of Energy Alexander Novak during his visit to Khabarovsk on July 24.
The governor also stressed that by 2025, Gazprom will be switching to supplying Russian gas plants and capacities, which means that Russian gas purchased in rubles will be used “at normal prices”.
The Sakhalin-1 project is implemented through a product division agreement, where the project operator with a 30% stake is Exxon Neftegas Ltd, another 20% of Rosneft, Japanese Sodeco - 30% and Indian ONGC - 20%.
The Khabarovsk region has been acquiring gas from this project since 2005.

The actor of the Russian series responded to accusations of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism"
The actor of the Russian series "Chiki", whose creators were accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism", responded to claims to the film.
The authors "understand the acuteness of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone," American Stephen Thomas Oksner said in a conversation with the publication "The Elevation".
“I think it’s a story about the power and the general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism,” said the actor, who played the father of the boy who was dressed in women’s clothing.
He stressed that he is “proud of the work” and does not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the plot line of the series: for example, there was a case when “a man in deep sweat shot the shooter and said that all this was not true.”
“Then there were a couple of cases when we met dissatisfied locals who didn’t understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who came first with the claims started to help us,” he added.
The shooting happened in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkariya: a drunk man attacked the car of a shooting group with a gun, after which he was detained by police.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for the protection of the family Olga Baranets sent a complaint to the Ministry of the Interior and Roskomnadzor to the service more.tv, which hosted the Russian series "Chiki".

The Ombudsman was also outraged by the fact that "a lot of attention was paid to the homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
The comedy drama "Chucky" tells the story of three prostitutes who started a new life and opened a business on the advice of a friend.
