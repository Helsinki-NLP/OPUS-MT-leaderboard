28-year-old cook found dead in shopping mall in San Francisco
A 28-year-old cook, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a grocery store this week.
However, the victim's brother says he doesn't know anyone who would have wanted to hurt him, and says, "His affairs finally went well."
The body, found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as a 28-year-old Frenchman Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Death Investigator's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was identified as a homicide and that an investigation was underway.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO channel in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a line cook in Boston, had acquired his dream job as a line cooker at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "horrified and shocked" by his death.
“We have a small team that works like a close family, and we will miss him very much,” he said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank stayed in hostels at the beginning, but that recently "his affairs finally went well".
"He found an apartment and met a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he doesn't know anyone who would have wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind and had a big heart.
His way of feeling connected with the family was to make us food, make us dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was a brother who was driving with the power.
“In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a flawless diamond that glowed brighter every day,” he said.
Anyone who has any information about the matter is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's identification number 415-575-4444.
Medical trainees on strike: Requirements for new occupational measures
Representatives of medical trainees have asked their trade unions to adopt new occupational measures in their dispute over the new agreement.
The British Medical Association’s (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) has called on the whole Council to support new anti-trafficking measures from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers have failed to address concerns about the agreement.
Medical trainees and medical students voted in July to reject a deal that had been agreed with BMA.
58% of the voters rejected it.
In a letter to members on Twitter on Thursday, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "self-sufficiently silent" about the issues that she said led to the rejection of the deal.
“In this light, the JDC government has voted to completely reject the proposed new agreement and demand formal renegotiations on all your concerns,” he said.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to authorise a progressive and expanding work-fighting programme beginning early in September.
There has been a controversy that medical trainees have participated in six strikes this year, including the first complete strike in the history of the NHS health care system.
BMA’s head of medical traineeships, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote rejected the terms negotiated by BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54,000 medical practitioners and students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, health minister Jeremy Hunt said the deal would be prescribed to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an association of outsiders?
The one who ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to deal with each other and declare the eight-month-long battle over words and economic sanctions officially ended.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of the Palace of St. Petersburg, I got the clear impression that Ankara wants more of this reconciliation.
Yes, they were handled on the occasion.
But Putin’s smile seemed violent, and he hardly threatened the heat, even according to his own restrained norms.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his “lovely friend” Putin – five times, according to a report.
I'm confused.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even to a better one.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan’s behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his passion is the opposite.
But Putin’s frivolity has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft at the border with Syria.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was outrageous.
Putin attacked, accusing Ankara of smearing Moscow in the back.
The injury was even worse when it came from an alleged friend.
Re-establishing true trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russia’s public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, state-run media led to a gruesome, thorough attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious allegations were made by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia has achieved some sort of victory.
The benefits of agreeing to an agreement with Ankara are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all his potential friends after he was almost expelled from power in a failed coup last month.
The ongoing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly nurtured him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia’s economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on order flights, which usually carry several million Russian strikes on the Turkish coast every year.
The amount has decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, local tour operators and airline booking companies will certainly be relieved when the flights are finally resumed.
They're looking forward to a late season in the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state television has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables since imports of agricultural products from Turkey are again allowed.
"You toured there, the tomatoes back here," as stated in the report of the Vedemosti magazine.
But the visit also had political added value to Moscow.
In Ankara, we are angry at what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
Adding to that the long-standing delay in the speedy progress of the EU membership negotiations, Putin stands out, who is eager to take advantage of the coolness and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader was assured to have taken off points from Ankara, where he called after the revolution to support the nominated authorities.
Of course, this is a survival for Moscow, which has its own deep roots in the fear of power transfer.
So this meeting at the Prairie Coastal Palace enabled an “external association” presented by Russia and Turkey, as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that experience Westerns abandoning them and treating them wrongly, can be combined.
The two, however, have large differences, despite a public conciliation act.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently agreed to be a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It can be awkward that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed the matter.
The Turkish president consciously avoided answering the question about their disagreements, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can find a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a NATO member's full disaster when Turkey shoots down a Russian fighter jet, it is certainly better that two leaders are back in the middle of the talks.
Royal Bank of Scotland Disappears from Non-Scotland Clients
According to the bank’s CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s international goals.
After the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago and it had to be saved, it has abandoned these goals.
The Bank’s strategies have used the ‘RBS’ brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used to sponsor international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands to come to the forefront.
Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except for headquarters and stock exchange listings will be converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a customer and staff tour in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will become the employer of our investor brand and our employees, because we will now become much more of a brand bank.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global targets, we have local targets.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff is working with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
“Now it’s time to move towards a branded bank, because basically (we’ve asked) it’s about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers,” the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we would be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we have done focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I believe you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins at Newmarket with Predilection and reaches 3,000 wins
Dettor sprays champagne after a double win, he has a total of 3,000 wins
A hairdresser, Frankie Dettore, warmed up his 3000th birthday at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached his crossroads on the second night of his victory on his home run in his competition with John Gosden's Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who had previously won at Ghayyari, said, "This is special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket, because here I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's an ordinary Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
The detective sucks himself in a hurricane when he puts Predilection out after a win.
Two racers have reached this milestone in obstacle competitions - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, with records in his career breaking over 4,300 wins.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racers of the present era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which few have achieved before him.
She is stylish and strong, but her tactical whims will distinguish her from the rest of the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador for competitions, his passion and charisma have attracted fans to the species for many years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have ridden 6,000 winners if he weren't just a weekend and big race jockey!
Frankie has been riding the winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He’s a lively person who’s a good thing for British competition, but besides that, he’s an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the staircase as a brand with a flying landing from the saddle.
From flying stops to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of the British race race for two decades.
This has been a mountain trail.
In 1996, he managed to win major competitions, including his famous ‘Magnificent Seven’ victory in Ascot, but he also survived an airplane crash and suffered from a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had a hard time coming back after six months of racing ban, but he showed a significant lack of character by challenging the suspects and returning to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettore has previously said that he would like to continue competing for at least 50 years.
Russian President Vladimir Putin to Separate Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed the prime minister Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement said Putin had "ordered Ivanovic to step down from the posts of the head of the Russian presidential administration", but there was no reason for this.
Ivanov's deputy director, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor since 2012.
The 44-year-old is a former diplomat.
He was born in the Estonian capital in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he led the president’s protocol and government staff, said on the Kremlin’s website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
In my view, the most important task of the administration is to support your role as Head of State in drafting laws and in managing the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his seat and recommended that Vaino be appointed as his successor.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a move that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies and, like Putin, served the Soviet security service in the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
During a meeting with President Putin on state television, the two men claimed that the prime minister had resigned at his own request.
But despite smiling at the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is just a post-war campaign?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man, once called a potential presidential candidate, suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy, has been received in a very suspicious way.
In his comments on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in the debate to give up for four years my responsibility for this very complex task, perhaps even to say at work.
“I’ve been president for four years and eight months now.”
Ivanov approved the task in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service in the KGB, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the state security service in the FSB, replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy president.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanovi could become President of Russia after the second term, because the third term of Putin would have been contrary to the constitution.
However, this task was given to another close ally of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before he returned to office.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson gets a shoe after hitting producer
Last month, Gibson participated in a physical contest at the filming venue of the series in Los Angeles.
The series' producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced their separation in a joint statement.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner played Gibson filed an apology on Thursday before his announcement of his fire.
There were creative differences and controversies at the scene.
“I’m sorry that happened,” he said in his statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details on how Gibson's character is removed from the FBI's storytelling series are expected later.
The 54-year-old starring Dharma & Greg has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
“I love the Criminal Minds series, and I’ve given it everything for the last 12 years,” Gibson said in a statement.
I had hoped to be involved until the end, but that's not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible team and above all the best fans that the series can have.
The twelfth production season of the series is scheduled for September 28.
Mysterious fishes end up in the garden in Banff
A man living in Banff has asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be the wind turbines that the water bike has left behind.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, published a film on the discovery at Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the discovery of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends Fifeen
<0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have combined the north coast of the Queensferry crossing with the mainland, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four slogans between the "citizens" who are now completing the bridge around each of the three pillars.
The Fifest bridge is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 concrete shells.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the country today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing.
We are all witnessing a truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge.”
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, finishing the gap between the ground and the bridge cover is a demanding operation in which extreme precise measurements must be matched.
Almost 79 per cent of the bridge is now in place, and the last part of the concrete cover is lying in Rosyth today, which means that the whole cover is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first closure in any bridge project is always a significant crossover.
In this fantastic project, this closure represents the cutting edge of construction technology.
When the last part of the slope had been installed and connected to the expanding northern slope of the slope, we then had to close the remaining part from the northern side, i.e. towards the interior.
This was done by dragging the bridges of the north side of the road 700 millimeters southward.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
It is huge, since the land is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tonnes and was to be pulled at about 3% angle of inclination.
Interesting because the permissible dimensional deviations, according to which the team worked, were small, only a few millimetres in either direction.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three Men Are “Happy When They Are Alive”
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they fell off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station issued an alert at 13:20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event evolving in Moelfre Bay Bay.
Three men were desperately trying to swim safely as their boat went on for themselves.
“We saw the boat rolling closer to the men and imagined the worst,” said Vince Jones, a cruiser at the Moelfre rescue boat.
"Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got on the move," he added.
A local fishing boat rescued two men, and a third, a 60-year-old man was found tired of moving the boy without a lifeboat.
The men were taken to the coastal rescue ship and brought back to the rescue ship.
Jones said: “These three men who have fallen into the water are lucky to be alive and completely harmless.
The boat's engine had your killer's break, but it was somehow disconnected from the person driving the boat when the boat crashed.
Somebody took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It’s fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather that they prefer to spend their free time watching the evidence.
Pokémon Go makes people get up from the couch and take part in some activity.
The screening time was originally limited to television, then video games, and now more recently to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activity do not exclude each other.
Of course, I refer to the wildlife called Pokémon Go. Application, which is based on characters that were originally developed in the 1990s for video games (they later created cartoons, game cards and other sequels).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
Players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon, which are tracked using GPS, and which can be “photographed” (by phone screenshot) or “catch” after finding them.
The generation who played the game as a youngster has joined the wild and jumped up from the couch in search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the "average person" daily steps.
The Apple Watch Cardiogram app, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s release, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent among Cardiogram users.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the training level data.
The calls for many public health campaigns to "find 30", "get off the couch" and "be active every day" have not produced any results because most public health warnings are boring and cared for by people who seem to be unhappy.
However, the importance of the movement cannot be underestimated.
Regularly moving people have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps in weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too many to be listed here.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As usual, grieving joymakers are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk towards the door.
What about that?
There's been a breakthrough.
While there were apps like Fitbit in the past that could monitor activity, they did not give a reason to move in the same way as this game.
The excitement of novelty disappears and the use ceases in time.
However, the success of Pokémon will result in other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunters to be more active, in better condition and healthier.

Simone Biles caught gold in women's gym
Forget the pressures.
Forget about publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to it all.
Energetic jumps.
Smooth in the bush.
Unbelievable permanently.
Great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American gymnast won a multi-competition championship on Thursday, leaving a gap between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic lighthouse.
His total score, 62.198, was clearly better than silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian semi-finalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles at the 2016 Brazilian Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, won the women's multiplayer final.
Biles became the fourth American woman to have won the championship in a row, and a total of five American champions. At the same time, she strengthened her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps of all time.
He burst into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement brings him to the same category with other top athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have elevated his race to a new level:
For the past three years, Biles has managed to win 15 world championship medals, including 10 golds, with programs blending honor and precision that have been so astounding that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best viewer".
The final test awaited in Brazil, a race that was not so much between Biles and the other competitors, but between his and the excesses of expectations.
Returning to the family’s home in Texas Spring without the choral gold medals would have been a disappointment.
The United States' Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman will win the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the women's multiplayer final at the 2016 Brazilian Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
Biles achieved his first medal on Tuesday, when he served as the excellence of the national team's retired coordinator, Martha Karoliy, in the lead.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought about the future while walking along the long road to the top, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program - which includes his brand of voltage construction - has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also fit perfectly on the street next to the Olympic Arena of Rio.
This is not a coincidence.
This girl, which her grandparents adopted as a carpet, and whose coach Aimee Boorman's mother found when she was on a study trip to the gym where Boorman was trained, has become a force.
He hasn’t lost in a multiplayer since the summer of 2013, and this win will continue for as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in the small lead after two rounds, it was just a delusion.
Balance and permanence, where Biles is the dominant world champion, awaited.
He climbed to the top with 15,433 and exceeded them by 15,933 permanence.
Raisma harassed him in a good way, as they waited for the endpoints - just formality - and tears rose in Biles's glittering red, white and blue bounded eyes, when the dream he once wrote in his short book came true.
Raisman's performance was some sort of revenge from four years ago, when he was in third place, but lost bronze to the Mustafin renewal.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, which the Americans call "grandmothers", was clearly in charge.
He sent flight rumors to the public after his permanence performance in an emotional outburst of return, which sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old tweet from the previous week takes on a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial murder shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl, who died in the first serial killer attack of the last decade, were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to a police briefing published on Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the road on June 12.
The report said the shooter, standing on the side of the car's passenger, shot his hand up to eight times and then fled by another vehicle.
According to police, the triple-homicide did not appear to have been the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not carry handbags or another adult victim’s <0x24>2,900.
The Phoenix Police Officer, Chief of Staff Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to check whether it was related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in the nine attacks that took place over the past four months in two major Latin American districts.
"These are happening in a residential area in front of the house," Howard told KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as the brown Nissan in the late 1990s, the black BMW in the late 1990s, as well as the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have not agreed to disclose evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are interrelated and are committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was wounded in a hospital where he died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The eyewitness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which took place just half an hour before the triple-homicide, and which was targeted by an empty open-air package car, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Scientists found claw shells, claw seat and claw slices from engine room.
6-year-old mother with microcephaly: "The situation is easing"
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But, unlike most of her peers, Edmund is small, a result of a genetic disorder that her mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
“When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't make a promise like this.
Which is not at all true – I certainly did promise,” he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a pedestrian.
Edmund didn't sit or steal until he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly reaching out to some of the cornerstones.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
She also loves to play with her two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows how Edmund's fictional notes refer to "sing to me".
"We'll teach him the language of reference," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a common language of reference - he tells us that Edmund has invented some of his own references.
Microcephaly can be caused for a number of different reasons: genetic causes, such as Edmund’s, or pregnancies with viral infections, such as ash or Zika virus.
Symptoms and predictions can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of people who have Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden caused by the uncertain future.
I was just wondering what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know.
Actually, I haven’t asked for a prediction of times, because I don’t expect anyone to be able to really give me that.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers who have Zika-related birth defects.
The situation is easing.
You can believe that the situation will ease.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Rising rains and floods caused rescue operations in Mississippi, Louisiana
Rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with the state expected to receive more rain on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded over their swamps and caused widespread flooding due to extreme rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that the state authorities are in constant contact with the local authorities, and that the aid is already coming to the districts in need.
Mike Steele, the Governor’s Security and Emergency Preparedness Office’s spokesman, said they would receive requests for vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood guard is in effect until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that the region is expected to receive three to five centimeters more rain.
In southern Alabama, the flood guard was in force on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
Both the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are located in Louisiana, and they were predicted to set a flood record over the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said the two rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said there was a lower threat of flooding the Ascension district along the river as the floods slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, was at the highest level of all time on Friday morning at nine o’clock.
Rescuers were still taking people out of the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson counties in southern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and son-in-law were among the rescued on Friday near Glosteria.
The 62-year-old Hansford says that normally over 400 feet away from his house, the water at Beaver Creek rose rapidly overnight.
He says the other guy, who lives nearby, warned him.
“We woke up, and the water just continued to rise,” Hansford said.
It went all the way to my waist.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she hasn’t seen the water so high in the 48 years she’s been living there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members have all injuries, and that he is the only swimmer.
Hansford said rescuers rescued a large triangle in an army-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station, where the rescuers stayed on Friday night.
Krautmann says the floods "spread rapidly" as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says one eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country was completely bored with the heavy rains that lasted until Wednesday.
The heavy rains and flooding of the streets led to the rescue of residents of Tangipahoa district from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, the authorities said.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a member of the city council in Tangipahoa said 200 homes were left under the flood.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now under a flood.
The district president, Robby Miller, said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been left behind for the climb.
The cities of Amiten and Hammond have been opened protections for those evacuated.
"They can go back to their homes when the water starts to drop," he said.
Twenty streets were closed in the city of Hammond, in Tangipahoa district, because of the rise, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep water away from their homes and movements.
“The last major flood here was in March,” Lacy Landrum, the city’s governing body, said.
This is going to be a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said the steady rain continued off the Gulf of Mexico.
He said on Thursday several houses were reported to have been flooded, but no flood cases have been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, Head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and the rain continues."
Six-year-old Mahay Brown, “Full of Nuts” Survives Philadelphia Shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown suffered several gunshot wounds to the thighs, legs, hands, and abdomen, among others, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"She suffered a lot, her little body was full of nuts," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical, and several surgeries have been performed on him.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting his first class at a local secondary school.
Brown was one of four people shot at the Germantown cartel.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two more victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car along with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be a shooter.
Scientists told CBS Philadelphia that it appears there was a cross between several shooters.
The attack weapon-type shells, originating from a variety of attack weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a continuous battle.
There were shelves on both sides of the pedestrian corridor on the street.
"So it looks like there were several armed fighters here, and they were active in the fight," Philadelphia police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also hit.
There have been no arrests and the police are investigating surveillance camera tapes.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was hit in the palm of her hand on Tuesday as she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That is why I am calling for this year’s Olympic women’s gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, after all, from America.
It has also established itself at the top of the inclusion of black and Latin American women.
The most successful female rapist in the last four years has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was surprised as the Olympic winner, and America hugged.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, where they present unexpected but masterful gym programs.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American woman to have consecutively won the individual cult in the women’s competition.
And teammate Aly Raisman got the silver.
We see the peak of the species, but the situation in this gymnasium does not seem to be across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie are all on the same path as Aly and Madison when they reach the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" (the last five) because in the next Olympic gymnastics team there will be only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive type, and gymnasts usually practice in private gym clubs maintained by parents who pay for training, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (trainers and their gymnasts) and their families.
Most of these gym permits are located in rich suburban suburbs that can support species.
With these clubs, gymnasts get all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to gymnasts’ families.
Aimee Boorman, the coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, the coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started exercising.
We need to bring cheaper and more accessible gym training to communities where Simone, Gabby and Laurie’s many young girls live.
I founded my gymnasium 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Latino) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we are expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-level gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic sport.
Strengtheners develop the strength of the body, flexibility and coordination, as well as the hardness of the mind, discipline and determination.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health as well as for school and work success.
This team’s inspiration makes thousands of young girls start exercising, and it’s great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We're living an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for taking the "girl power" seriously by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start their journey towards a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
Medical trainees to organize new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials, but 58% of the 37,000 medical practitioners who voted rejected it.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to force the deal, saying the NHS was "unknown on the ground", and that even minor delays are damaging staff and patients.
The first medical trainees will be transferred to a new agreement, which includes changes to night and weekend work practices to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of BMA's Committee of Medical Trainers, said last night in a statement: "Medical trainees are still seriously concerned about the proposed agreement, especially that it will accelerate existing labour crises."
When the time before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new contract is only eight weeks, progress must be made and the time is running out.
The BMA’s attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced the government’s reluctance to participate and occasionally deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
“Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of medical practitioners.
If he does not do so, medical trainees are ready to continue working.
The last strike at the end of April meant nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 postponement of the reception period, when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to serve as substitutes for doctors in the strike guard.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 medical trainees under the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of the NHS Employers organization, appealed to medical trainees not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “Working struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on already demanding teams and services, as well as cause concern, anxiety and disruption to patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of supervision (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing (Whistleblowing).
Employers hoped that there would be a continuous positive discussion with other important topics - such as development, flexibility of education, additional training for returnees, education expenses, mutual recognition of the curriculum on the subject of education, on the subject of education, on the subject of education, on the subject of education, on the subject of education, and on the subject of sexual intercourse.
A drug that costs two pounds a day can reduce your risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are taking advantage of the drug that costs two pounds a day after the authorities recommended that it be given to people for longer.
The anticoagulant medicine, ticagrelor, lowers the risk of recurrence of seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another stroke.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to still reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to still reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Approximately 140,000 people have a heart attack each year in England, and a quarter of them have a second stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a fatty substance that accumulates in the wall of the artery, which forms angina.
If the atrial fibrillation ruptures, it can cause blood clotting, which prevents the circulation to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the fungus releases, it can go along with the blood and cut the bloodstream into the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one scene have an increased risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making coagulation less likely.
In today’s NICE draft guidelines, it is recommended that people receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice a day for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE’s Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: “Despite the availability of effective progressive preventive treatments, even a quarter of people with a heart attack will later have a second heart attack or stroke, with multiple consequences.”
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we initially recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to add the treatment options available to thousands of people who may benefit from them.
Because data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, particularly as regards the risk of bleeding, are limited over a period of more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend treatment for longer than during this period.
A culture of political correctness allows the blooming of walnuts in Muslim regions
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year due to corruption, giving impetus to the government's report.
The culture of political correctness has led to widespread vote fraud in Muslim communities being overlooked, the shocking government report reveals today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles has deposed police, election officials and city officials for neglecting evidence of election fraud due to "race and religion-related hypersensitivity".
Former Community Secretary, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said that voter intimidation on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to put guard chains outside voting sites to protect feared voters.
He recommends that voters should present an identity card when voting in order to prove who they are.
Currently, the voter has only to say his name and address.
The report even proposes that the voter's finger be put to the undisputed black so that no one can vote twice.
Reporters should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for broader access to the press to the documents and decisions of the Board of Directors by informal committees or working groups.
“This would not only protect the local government from the culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with the electoral roll,” he said.
The government ordered the report as a result of the East London Tower Hamlets vote scandal.
Last year, the Special Election Court ruled that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from the office as a result of numerous corruption and illegal acts.
The court noted that Rahman had "voluntarily distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamism.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of the faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were conceivable or the result of a person voting for the performance in some other way.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern in voting at the polling station, where senior members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations to clean up the voting system, including proof of identity with an ID
He said in his report: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote at the will of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
“There was concern that the state institutions had ignored such behavior because of the ‘politically correct’ sensitivity to race and religion.”
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including the refusal to allow political activists to deal with ballots sent to the post in order to stop the "collection of voices".
The report, which is being reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for more stringent amendments to the registrations in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Check out the options for proof of voter identity before voting.
Use the undisputed black on the finger of the voter so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail voting.
Prevent political activists from handling mail-ready voices and mailboxes where the voices are sent.
Let the police put guard chains around the polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to accuse people of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal in polling stations.
Require that only English (except in Wales) is used in voting places.
Strengthen training to ensure that the staff adheres to the rule that the voter must go to the cup alone.
Sir Eric called the Greater London police force, saying it was "astonishing" that no criminal charges had been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Election Court was left behind as a result of numerous acts of corruption and illegality by Lutfur Rahman and his officials," he said.
He was found guilty on the basis of numerous grounds without any doubt, according to criminal evidence.
He also criticized ineffective "rapid checks" in the voting registry agencies of the municipal councils.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets trial was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a gloomy legacy as the birthplace of parliaments, but this worrying and mysterious spread of electorate and the denial of facts by certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Insane Kate Bicycle Double Isolation and Other Celebrities Posted at the Rio Olympics
This week's fans at the Rio 2016 Olympics have gone crazy about French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the Duchess of Cambridge's impressive double flight.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only goldfighting athlete this summer who can boast of his own famous twin flight - at least according to social media.
So in honor of Rio’s competitions and all the famous faces on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's sniper team, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s twin existence on the cycling trail, many people on the net have been quick to notice how a particular sniper could be the star of Leonardo DiCaprio’s twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's sniper team, has caused a storm on Twitter since his photos surfaced, showing him as scary as The Wolf of Wall Street star.
And in fact, when he became aware of the passion of social media, the sniper admitted that he had heard from a child that he looked like Leo.
“I don’t see a great chance of being single, except maybe with a couple,” Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is courtesy."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will certainly emerge this year: the astonishing likelihood between British length jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafana is said to be the big, apparent eye of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghi has been compared for years to the Glee star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger exchange of sight: This user thinks Nathan is the "sports version" of the Inception actress
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver artist Yulia Efimovalla has more than the same actress Annalynne McCordin as brown skin and light hair, while U.S. team Nathan Adrian reminds fans of "the sporty version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Hard Women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very happy that others saw similarities as well
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, the similarity between pairs can be a cause
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site that "everyone else on the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American soccer star and Dexter's star really has an amazingly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who owns the beautiful wide smile of Bring It On -star Gabrielle Union's smile.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes after Chinese swimmer says he's "dead like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of a 14-year-old Ai Yanhan instead of a 4x200-meter women's release message angered CBC's live broadcast viewers on Wednesday.
Canadian television company CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its narrators said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese woman's beard had "destroyed like a bad smell" and "dead like a pig".
Writer Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started sharing some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle final.
MacDonald, who came to CBC’s reporting team to bring “colour,” was heard saying, “Bring a small 14-year-old from China to your diaper, baby.
Too enthusiastic, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese striker Ai Yanhan, 14, floated the second half of the message at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to capture China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online when they were shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'???
The idiot didn't realize he was still on live broadcast."
The Chinese Ai Yanhani was described in the 4 x 200-meter women’s freelance finale as follows: “Bring a little 14-year-old girl from China to you, baby.”
Reviewing Byron MacDonald on Twitter was hesitant and fast, when many challenged him.
Twitter users did not arrest themselves when they heard how disrespectful Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like racist."
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was involved in the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We're sorry that the comment on the swimming performance was being sent.
It was a regrettable choice of words, we are sorry that this happened.”
The CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
His colleague, Scott Russell, had to apologize for MacDonald.
CBC then copied and attached an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The television company also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent directly.
We took action quickly last night and apologised to our viewers and our followers on social media in the live broadcast.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and regrettable choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I'd like to apologize at this point for the comment I made last night after the women's message," she said in a statement to CBC.
"I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not him as a person."
"It seems unnecessary to say that I didn't mean it disrespectfully, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark’s customer is upset by a woman who rubbishly arranged underwear in the middle of the store
Customers didn't know what to look at when the woman disguised herself in the middle of Primark's movement to try underpants.
Things didn't improve because, after assessing how she looked in the pants, the woman cuts them off on the top and puts them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and eventually agreed to four pairs of underwear at the store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
Primark's move at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where a woman wore underpants and then put them back on the shelf
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, said that after trying underwear, the mysterious woman “re-dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.”
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the trade floor, took a pair of underpants on the front, took off her own panties and underwear, and put on her adjustable feet.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place for reconciliation, he just stood there shamelessly."
"Everyone was staring at him when he pulled off his underpants again and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before finally deciding that he didn’t like anything he saw, dressed again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care about who was looking - or thinking of a person who would end up buying the underpants he agreed on."
Davidson, 33, who lives in the city of Kent, said, “It’s disgusting to think that someone brings home underpants that someone else has tried but hasn’t been cleaned.”
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, “I saw that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothes from the sale after the woman left, which is very good.”
“It would be awful to go home with new underpants and find that another woman has dressed them up and taken them off and hasn’t washed them.”
Primark spokesman said: “Primark is aware of the incident that took place in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been removed from sale.”
How to Defend Against Armed Attacks Using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Krav Maga Federation Mayor Rhon Mizrach in New York to find out how to deal with the harassing robbers in the vicinity.
Approached to you either from the front or back, this video shows you how to pay the attacker on the same scale.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached behind, you must first turn to see your attacker and "take the line of fire".
You will then tap the gun between your hip and shoulder before hitting the attacker's face on your free hip.
Continue hitting the knee on the cheeks, and when the attacker goes from pain to pain, turn the gun from his hand, hit him with the gun on his face, and retreat with the gun aimed at him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is the same: remove your body from the fire line, grab a gun and turn it around so that the criminal cannot fire.
At the same time put pressure on the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun from his suit, turn back and point him with a gun.
Does it sound difficult?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi is doing this.
But remember, if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright squeezes the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
The British traveler has placed a serious challenge on his immune system and his vomiting reflexes by arguing some of Europe’s most dirty and overnight places.
The Suffolk-born director and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, would lay down a euro banknote, a rope at Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet rinse button and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before swiping each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was in.
However, the experiment, which made the film in the footsteps of Internal Power, produced surprising results.
The idea of lowering the rinse button of a train used by thousands of people may seem completely opposing, but in fact, the kitchen sink has more bad bacteria.
On his journey across Europe, Wright constantly spoke to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing of his arrows left him in the mouth of an evil taste.
Wright became known as a tester for the endurance of his intestines as he travelled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task ranging from the public railway station belts to the toilet seat rinse button really tested his immune system.
In the film, she said, "Since childhood, I've been pretty careless about my health, and I've put all sorts of things in my mouth, from soil, sweets and fresh water."
He really got his reputation back during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
In his sample, there were more than 4,000 units in the photometer.
For comparison, the reading of the hands that have been washed should be less than 60.
But at a Russian public visit, he did not agree to swipe when the photometer's result showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the counter-washed hands was less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler's film, in the footsteps of Internal Force, together with a Finnish dairy owner, Valion. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the voice said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to swing anything, because there's a nightlife here.
In the aftermath of the internal force, it was produced together with the Finnish milker, Valion.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, to help boost human intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, head of Valio’s snacks, juices and new categories, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up thinking 'let's play for Ian.'
They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell you about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with the help of this documentary we can in an interesting way tell more about it to consumers.
I think the document also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The documentary’s director, Tom Hakala, added: “Let’s just say this: if Ian had slipped some of the things I asked him to do, such as a Russian night-time visitor in the film, I would have lost my respect for him.”
Understandably, some of the arrowheads were easier for Ian, while some were quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty holidays recorded."
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products to which lactic acid bacteria have been added.
The family destroyed the rental house in Cornwall, Saltash, before the wedding.
The <0xC3><0x96>jkäri family caused <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damages to their rental property after they were detained for terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Keldo and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after being sued several times.
When they were removed from the property by force, the shocked employees of the housing company found that the property was in poor condition.
The walls were fired with holes, the floor panels were torn, the waste was spread on the floor, and the walls were rubbed with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in private housing.
Conna McEvoy, the host of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid the property could not be repaired.
He said: “This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I don’t think people should have to live this way.
There are many things to consider here, as this property is likely to be known through the less comfortable groups in Cornwall.
This family is poor, and their name is poor.”
The couple had three boys who lived in between the properties, and according to police, the family’s terror included street fighting on baseball holidays, intimidation of close residents, drug use, sales, and unprecedented screaming, arguing, and curses.
47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was in the lease, received a decision in June on unsocial behaviour.
Many of the rooms of the house under the debris were found old waste.
The property, from which drugs had previously been transferred, had the floor panels smashed up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police were called regularly.
Cornwall Housing married by means of a woman and this partner’s property this week after giving them an extended period, 11 weeks, the time to voluntarily change.
Relaxed neighbors thanked the wedding, saying that their lives had become just as hell.
Someone said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived as their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here incredibly many times.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It’s great now that they’re finally gone.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, CEO of Cornwall Housing’s neighborhood, said the family had not cooperated with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property
The rubbish and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the rental house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her family's behavior, as the wedding is always the last way Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, as the conduct was extreme, and their actions must have been horrified by the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and the courageous, community members who have given us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
After the wedding, a dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom
Home Employees Need to Clean the Waste Areas Surrounding the House
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis as well as bags, supplies and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for being charged with possession of a class b drug with the intention of distributing it forward.
He claimed that the money was intended for the funeral of his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently Tanya and her partner live homelessly after freezing now in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were dominated by graffiti.
Police say they are trying to distract residents who ridicule the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police said the wedding was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to ridicule the rules.
"This is a message to those who think their behavior is without penalties, as well as to those who suffer from such behavior," he said.
The police in Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour; the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.

At this very moment, the frightened tourists began to panic when a low-flying shower machine sweeps over a beach full.
Dramatic footage shows how the military aircraft came almost to a distance from the sun worshipers on a sandy beach in Aveiros, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up as they understood that they were starting to worry about the mesh from the shower machine, even though at first they did not see what was coming behind the clouds to them.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic outlook on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It went through twice really low, and together, it looked like it was going to fall to the ground."
Nuno Arroja added: “I was surfing and it really felt like the plane was falling on me.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveiros were horrified when the plane emerged from the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the sprayer had flown significantly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by nearby landslides, but the air force assured that no one's safety was in danger.
Earthquakes have destroyed parts of the mainland of Portugal this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force said today that the pilot had to fly due to low visibility conditions, the smoke caused by the fires and a thick fog.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the training the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
The results of the first half of the year are better than expected.
The social and health sector (Exote) in South Karelia made a better result of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.4 million than planned in January-June.
The result of the exodus was a surplus of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional management.
The guarantee of care was carried out in all activities.
This year, Exote aims to shorten the measures.
The exodus covers by surplusing the previous deficiency.
The remaining amount may be used to shorten the strings and purchase measures for patients.
The full year’s result is projected to be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4.6 million better than planned.
The Board of Exotes will discuss the semi-annual review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Doctors Sworn in Military War in Immola
A total of 70 officers of the Border and Marine Guard School vowed military service on Friday.
The military demonstration of the Armed Forces and Marine Guards School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Medical Course was held at the team's sports ground.
There were 70 soldiers sworn in.
Specialised Border Doctors are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people have applied for Special Border Doctor.
250 of them were selected.
Specialised border doctors have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the war-time border forces participated in the meeting during the election.
The average age of the participants is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
ESS.fi - Crime Investigation helps to investigate crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 police stations in Finland has been operated by the RTA, a criminal investigation and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is externally invisible.
The Hämeen police station has a total of four police officers in Lahde and Hämeenlinna.
That's what the Lieutenant-in-Chief in the Bay draws.
As Chief of Staff, the Commissioner is in Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
They all work in civilization.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces different investigations for other police officers.
It has, among other things, obtained information about asylum seekers.
Renewal of new ways of working
The establishment of analytics units is the most recent reform of police working methods.
The aim was to prevent crime, which meant that the police were less and less likely to go to the place where the pills were called until they were alerted.
The information collected and analysed by the unit targets the day-to-day police activity where it is most needed.
As part of the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre was established, with its three national units and each police station having its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR centre, which operates in the context of the Vantaa Central Crime Police, operates nationally.
In the PTR units, people from the Police, Customs and Border Guards are working according to their name.
The RTA units, in turn, work in areas divided by police agencies and have the task of providing information to both local police forces and national units.
The survey extends outside of your area
Where an individual policeman is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour work hours, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on in the entire police station area.
The investigation also extends beyond the borders of your own institution, as crime also does.
Workers in the RTA unit have a better level of R&D skills than the basic police.
The Unit seeks to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminal or reminiscent of crimes, through registers, alert mission databases and detections.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal investigation.
Every person has their own way of acting.
The footprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the method of work, a certain image of the author is formed.
Serialization can be done either on the basis of a person or a person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
RTA employees do not carry the collars in the city vertically, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by criminals and their own are not disclosed, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities, thereby aiming at preventing police criminal investigations.
The methods will be publicly reported by the police if it anticipates a threat to them.
This was the case, for example, from the beginning of the summer, with the labelling of empty apartments used in residential breaks.
In it, the perpetrators set up an outdoor water jacket, a knob, or a tape piece of the apartment with which they tried to see if the residents were really traveling.
The present investigation material shall be public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals take lessons from their mistakes.
The most prolific are signing a District Court Protocol, which can, for example, indicate that fingerprints have been found on the site.
Next time, the thief will wear gloves in his hand.
For the case, Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppäs was interviewed about Häme’s Police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepola of East Finland Police, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärve of Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Investigator Arto Tuomela of Central Criminal Police.
The police collects and analyzes information that allows them to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in the amount of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last change was the three-phase PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
With national cooperation, information is collected from outside the institution and outside the borders of Finland.
A schoolgirl who joined her father was killed in Syria in London
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join Dad, has reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said that the girl's family heard this dead in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian statement at Raqqa, the organization’s base in the country.
Sultan was 17 years old and, according to his family, he died just as he was planning an escape from the war-torn country and returning to Britain.
"We can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and a testament to others, that leaving the war zone poses real risks - that it could cause people to give up making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other East-Turkish schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from which they took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan’s family were told that the girl had married an ISIS fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow only a few months later.
Reid Says Clinton Considers Garland's Supreme Court Candidate Should He Be Elected
Senate Democrat Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's reaffirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect a deceased member of the Supreme Court to replace Anton Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday in a phone call that he predicted with "severe certainty" that Clinton would elect Garland.
The Ride spokesman later said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would name Garland, and that it was speculation.
He criticized Garland and said that Clinton’s team would not want to “influence the boat” with a new election.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid said Republicans preventing Garland's appointment are Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump's "scary" and "potentialists".
He said Trump did not apply to the office.
Treats says the bare calendar is "for women as well as men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemer to publish the 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of nude celebrities, they intend to find the next-generation top model in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with plenty of nude photos differs from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I'll do this to women.
Apparently he thinks there's a calendar for them too.
“We have to begin again to present a timeless and classical nudity where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images depicting a woman’s naked body,” Shaw said in a press release.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can leave pictures online or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl Destination: Who Really Buys Discs?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you rush to fill the comment section with annoyed insults, the author of which is labeled NoAllSingleMiddle-age Men, notice that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much spoken new arrival of records is not due to the fact that more and more people born in this millennium are enthused by the new fascination with physical objects, but by the middle-aged noise.
Apparently, those who recently bought vinyl plates are most likely 45-54 years old.
In fact, the most unlikely of all those who buy discs belong to the age group of 18-24-years-olds.
It is also not just about collecting fans, but also about the significance of it: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their emotions in them (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy exclusivity (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me while I was in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit. I would point out vividly before I stopped, form a cup from my hands and say something worthwhile, like, "Let's check it out."
Let's look into it more closely.
At the same time as Soho’s charm and dirt are slowly being removed – hotels, chain restaurants and shops, as well as office supplies stores are now filling the buildings where formerly there were independent movements – a handful of stunning specialty record stores are still left.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment when I stand very close to different men in some of these stores while trying to assess by observing their age and emotional temperament.
The Glasgow-born Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in their twenties), spends her afternoon in London, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the night.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
"I am, too," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 discs.
These discs, which are shown in the picture above (he sent the sample by email, did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of records and singles is partly due to his available income: now he can buy records he did not have to afford when they were originally released, and he can buy back those he sold when he was young and without money.
"Most of the material I bought is from the late 60s and early 70s, records that were released when I was 11 or 12, records that I probably was a little too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that buyers of records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: “I don’t smoke or drink a lot.
This is my evil.”
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers she meets fit into YouGov’s profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by media enthusiasm. People who have heard that the discs have become fashionable again and who have come to need to buy their old discs back.
Based on the discussions I've been having, people usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy back their records,” he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of certain age-old vinyl shells.
But what about the alleged significance of the discs?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comfortable community for similar types.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly affected by the near-payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be haunted by the digital world and choose to rely on the permanence of familiar disc covers; objects that awaken memories of the happy days of adolescence.
“I think sometimes it can be about filling a hole or some kind of comfort that the possession of objects creates,” Wez says.
As a collector, I also admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It is an easy way to fill your thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" said another employee suddenly from the surface of the disc.
A poll conducted by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought the vinyl plate in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a record player.
At this point, I would probably look seriously concerned about the news report by browsing the pile of bossa nova collections.
This “reward” aspect of the awakening is something that Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe, has also noticed.
"Someone came in a while ago and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead disc so we can put it on the shelf'," he says.
This is not a big deal, but this is definitely the case.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
Not the older people, but the younger people, the late-aged, who are just excited about it.
In Fopp, where today there is almost a whole floor reserved for vinyls, there is a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventy couples, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned movements - from the loudspeakers to the freshest Wild Beat’s latest sinister and sex-filled pop, and not the improvisation jazz - it’s great to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it’s hard to prove a painful psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Foppia for a few minutes to watch the various records on sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says there's not much going on, so record collection isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It’s easy to listen to music either on a computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is...” she whispered in love.
"I don't know how to explain - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to awaken a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
At the same time as I was trying to look like I was exploring jersey shorts, I noticed a group of teenage girls gathering around Polaroid cameras for a moment before father and daughter were thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac discs covered: a mix of contemporary music and classics, any discs essential to the midrange collection.
No one looks at them - maybe because they are just decorative, and some are so high that touching them would be impossible.
These are purely "art vinyls".
But given that getting a little attention from these items can mean more money for the industry and sending a few customers to Soho Cancers to get more, there is not much to complain about.
It is not surprising that the population that has more likely to have more time and money is also the one that spends the most on luxury items, such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate at least in Soho record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in the office.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday nights minimizing around the Berwick Street record stores by browsing the records and avoiding the ugly, 30-year-old artificial television presenter’s gaze over the shoulders of the unharmed middle-aged men.
Holker is the longest living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the holger has a longer lifespan than any other spinal cord on the planet.
Julius Nielsen says the record is for a female, believed to be between 272 and 512 years old, and five meters in length.
French court rejects application to dismantle shops from Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a request by the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants from the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court proceedings this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary trades in which people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer a haircut, or sell tea for 50 ounces of tea on a roadside or for 40 cents.
The Calais Prefect's office argued that the places should be dismantled because they represent a tax-free parallel economy and because they are a fire and cleanup risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the Court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals offered by the state-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary grocery stores and restaurants often offer protection and free meals to those in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there were no legitimate grounds for the expulsion of 72 people running temporary stores, but said the Calais prefect’s concern “was completely understandable”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than simply feeding people “in extremely uncertain conditions”.
He said the premises provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the drainage door was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, which operates non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, as well as shelter for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect children’s cafes.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was stated that closing the cafe would “be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.”
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 — the peak — since the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
The price of bread in Finland drops significantly faster than the EU average
In Finland, food is sharply depleted for the sake of consumers and at the expense of producers.
In Finland, the price of bread has fallen by almost 5% in three years, compared with the average price of bread in EU countries falling by 0.9%.
At the same time, food has become 1% more expensive in Germany and Sweden.
Over the past three years, food prices in Finland have fallen to the second highest in the EU countries with a similar pay level to those in Finland.
Only in the UK, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The information is published by Ilkka Lehtisen, Head of Development at Statistics Centre, published in the blog Tieto & Trends.
The leaf compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed the turn, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
The Russian food import bans, which have slowed food exports from Finland to Russia, are now burdening the price.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products in the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
“Putin’s policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition in industry and trade has also affected the price drop.
The major trading chains of the S-Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been shown as prominent advertising campaigns.
Nevertheless, Finland is still not a low-cost diet planner, even though the price of food has fallen abundantly.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in the EU, with a similar salary level as in Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the VAT rates were the same, the cheapest food from the same third countries would be sold in Finland at the same level of wages.
The newspaper compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the country, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell food cheaper than the Finns.
“If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in terms of food prices, the VAT must be halved by the EU’s average level and continue price competition,” Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen notes that his calculations at the rate of VAT are indicative.
The school is no longer its former
You may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all secondary schools.
It is a guide that says that all Finnish schools will operate.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells you the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of fine-grained writing is abandoned, and instead, coding is practiced in schools.
Swedish education starts in the sixth grade at the latest, and social education starts at the fourth.
The biggest change is the role of the students.
It used to be thought that the teacher teaches the students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
In this way, the school visit is made more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
Ice-haired Greenlandish shrimp (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches sexual maturity only at the age of 150.
It can live for another 250 years, according to a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrae in the world today.
In the zoo, it is bypassed by only an Icelandic pigeon whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507 years old.
Greenland swamps swim along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch dogs longer, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Because the growth rate is slow, according to the tracks only about a centimeter a year, adult individuals have probably lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen found out about his colleagues.
He identified some of the 28 females left behind in the fisherman’s catches for adult frogs.
The age of the lenses was revealed by radiocarbon limitation of the lenses.
The average age of the studied sharks was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-centimeter amazon populations, were revealed to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Because previous studies have found that ice skates only reach sexual maturity by more than a square meter, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at the time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired for nearly 300 - sellers are not deducted
Almost 300 employees will be fired from Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the company, which was in difficulty, ended in early August.
"As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs will be cut, the majority of which will be laid off," Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of vendors of warehouses is not deducted so that customer service does not suffer.
In addition, about 80 employees in support functions are offered a new job as a seller.
Stockmann's YT negotiations involved about 3,000 employees.
At the beginning, the reduction requirement was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction of population aims at annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are expected to be achieved over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million this year.
In the background, Stockmann’s difficulties in getting a profit from the grocery store.
Although the Group’s adjusted turnover improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, commodity sales are still losing.
According to Stockmann CEO Lauri Veijalaise, sales in warehouses have not exceeded the objectives set by the company.
"Unfortunately, staff reductions are necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail will have a positive turnover in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
The second quarter’s performance improvement was based on Lindex’s good success, in particular.
The chain achieved its best sales and profits in the second quarter of all time.
Lindex’s operating profit grew from EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the total revenue of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s turnover this year will decline from last year.
The adjusted turnover is expected to be a bit positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees across the country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, according to HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There are rainy seasons in the central part of the country, but the southern part is steep.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury remains below 20 degrees throughout the country.
In the northern rainy regions, stay at 10-15 degrees.
Kenyan sports team is ravaging doping scandal – a strange explanation for the coach’s execution
Kenyan general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah appeared as a country team athlete in a doping test.
The AP news agency said the athlete Anzrah attempted to perform was the 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Kenyan national team leader Stephen Arap Soi said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials went to the authorities in Anzrahi.
According to Soin, Anzrah was sent home because he "made a crime against the Kenyan national team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behavior," said Kip Keino, chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, in a statement to Reuters.
The Olympic general sport starts on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run immediately.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year and is ahead of Rio’s winners’ favourites.
According to Reuters, a source within the Kenyan general sports team claimed that Anzrah went with the athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was put to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid that it would be revealed,” the source said.
Where's everybody?
Rio's public sports stadium is empty.
Where are they all right?
At least they don’t play sports at the Olympic Stadium in Rio.
On Friday, Rio started the competition for public sports medals, but the world’s top players were able to showcase their skills to a confusing, empty audience.
Rio’s organizers said Friday that only 58% of the tickets for the first day’s morning shows and 65% of the evening’s tickets were sold.
The second one was four years ago in London, where the stadium was populated by a horrifying crowd.
Tickets for the finals have already been sold out in Rio.
The distribution of the Rio Olympics has already attracted attention before the general sport.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the spectators of rugby, melon and horseback riding.
When Brazilian medalist Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball at the legendary Copacabana, it was only 70 percent full.
After the Brazilian coup, the Netherlands played against Russia, and the 12,000 viewers were just about 30% full.
The bad losses are at least explained by the fact that Brazil, struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian racers, and many of the Olympics are strange to Brazilians who are accustomed to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not get a watered soccer stadium complete.
At the end of the weekend, Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the event, said 82 percent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is significantly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada told Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million London Olympic tickets, 8.2 million were sold, although tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, the prices of tickets ranged from about nine euros to more than a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.
At the Olympic Games in London, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Rio, as organizers need money and are trying to get tickets for sale until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for lesser-known species, such as golf and rugby.
In the morning, there were plenty of empty spaces at the Rio Stadium.
Even beach volleyball in the Copacabana sand has not attracted the public.
Jukka Midfielder competed in London in 2012.
People in the newspapers were enough.
A new way to protect nature - acquire the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in the conservation of nature in the latest ways.
Established last year, the foundation acquires ecologically important natural areas.
After that, private companies and entities can redeem the ownership rights of the land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land from Lapis.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks that will be available to all interested parties for a fee of ownership.
The holder is given a right of veto to a block of 187 squares, which in practice means that not every holder will need approval if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Ownership rights can also be acquired for multiple blocks.
The acquisition of an administrative right is something concrete that can be left as a legacy or as a gift.
You don’t have to go wearing banners or shovel yourself somewhere to protect nature,” Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the management right for his company, explains.
The administrator acquirer receives accurate location information from his block, which allows for, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the names of the acquisitions of ownership rights appear on the same map where the block data of the land can be found.
The leaf fabric sees the risk of its natural protection procurement only in the fact that the foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of public interest, which aims to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would somehow act unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Holdija project of the Helsinki Foundation is the protection of natural areas so that they can be intact and peaceful.
The Foundation acquires land either through purchase or as a donation.
It finances its operations mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The aim of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also targets outside the borders of Finland and is planning to purchase goods from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Trader on August 13-19.
Cycling thieves torture the worst of major cities in Turku - see your local situation
Bicycle thefts are one of the worst in Finland’s major cities in Turkey.
This year, more wheels have been stolen than in nine other major cities in the country.
On the basis of the bicycle thefts reported to the police, Sanomat of Helsinki found out how many of the ten largest cities had stolen bicycles in January-August of this year and parts of them calculated per 1,000 inhabitants.
In addition to the market, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to police, there were four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported.
That's a big difference.
“In other cities, double the number of robberies occurs in proportion to the population,” said Tommi Reen, police inspector of the Police Department.
The market police are wondering why the city is at the forefront of comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer to that.
“The frequency of warnings can be influenced by how much of the city is moving on wheels and how much of the wheels are at all,” said Lieutenant General Teemu <0xC3><0x84>ikäs.
The police government, Tommi Reen, expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts varies largely depending on which cities are studying and cycling.
The market is close to the center, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a very different type of city, where city centres are far from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
The total number of bicycle thefts reported in Finland in January-August is slightly lower than in the corresponding period last year.
There is still no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police are aware of just over 20,000 bicycle thefts every year.
It means 50-60 fillers per day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 wheels per year.
“It’s a lot,” Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more wheels, as only a few of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to make a criminal report of bicycle theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police will survive.
A typical detected bicycle theft is one in which the police are informed of the theft immediately and the thief is trapped in his blood.
“There are also cases in other investigations where, for example, stolen wheels can be found in a drugged apartment,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thefts are arrested weekly for their own crime or in connection with a police investigation, according to senior police officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bicycles are stolen, for example, from shopping malls’ wheelchairs, inner courtyards, warehouses and bicycle paths, i.e. virtually anywhere they are usually stored.
The most individual bike models are stolen in the same way as in previous years.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves, for example, take the bike for short-term use, but a large part of the stolen bikes end up on sale, for example, via the internet.
They remain in the domestic market.
“At least the police have not come to the knowledge that the stolen wheels would go very little abroad,” Reen says.
The buyers of stolen bicycles are, according to police, ordinary Finns.
Some will probably buy a stolen bike unknowingly.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful as he or she may be guilty of concealment or violation.
"The alarm clocks should be ringing if the good condition bike is sold at a clear lower price," Reen says.
Special Librarian Severi Hirvi always wears his colourful Nopsana for the duration of his working day under the protection of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but none has been stolen, says the Monster. "There has never been taken, there has been a good monk."
"Well, maybe this doesn't attract thieves so much, there's not necessarily any hipster value here," Hirvi, a Helsinkier, said.
Siiri Valve closed his bike with a small U-Location in a kiosk in Helsinki, Kallio.
Now the bike leaned against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks his bike into something fixed, such as a wheelbarrow.
"There's a lot to think about, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says a Helsinki student about his white bike, whose body alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time I hear from my friends that the wheels have been taken away."
"First of all, bad wheels, that kind of stuff."
A bicycle was stolen from the company’s interior a year ago.
The bike had been unlocked, so Valve could wait for it to be pulled.
You're under 15 years of age to blame for your crimes?
Helsinki to test U.S. peer-reviewed crews
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-to-peer crew is trying to prevent young people from getting into the crime scene.
Initially, the trial applies to children under the age of 15, who are now without criminal liability.
The crew is missing the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer-to-peer crew will discuss the incident with the perpetrator and impose a penalty.
A week later, the perpetrator of the crime can join the peer group to compensate for his actions.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth CEO Tommi Laitio says the model is not strict.
We also have other conciliation models that are used in parallel.
“Everyone is guided in a more responsible direction so that everything is not ruined by the first mistake,” Laitio says.
A model of the United States, where it is widely used, has been incorporated into the comparative crew.
The idea is that after the first crime, the young man does not face an adult panel, but reflects on what has happened with nearly the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a Palmu service designer who followed the experiment, says that it was a maltreatment that was successfully resolved.
In particular, the first offences of less than 15 years of age may not have been treated at all.
“It’s been a message that you continue on the path you choose,” Lovio says.
The team is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the Helsinki City and Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new approaches are being offered to all those in need, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans Want Party to Stop Financing Trump Campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter calling on the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American magazine Politico, which had received it to view the draft.
According to the newspaper, an open letter is addressed to the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party’s money to be channeled to Congress instead of Trump’s campaign.
“We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disrespect, incompetence and record-breaking incompetence, are threatening to bring voter turnout to Democrats in these elections,” the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds to Congressmen can prevent Republicans from drowning in the Trump-correct anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent within the next week.
Among the signatories are among others politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizers of the letter is apparently Republican Andrew Weinstein, who opposes Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect the majority in Congress" and that it is not about endorsing anyone.
The letter lists several of Donald Trump’s actions, believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security said in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton pledges relief to U.S. child families
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told about her economic policy details on Thursday night.
I am trying to make sure that the U.S. economy is going well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in a speech.
At the heart of Clinton’s plan is a massive, <0x24>275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure – roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be financed in part by tax increases for the rich, in part by private money.
The construction program is a hand-over to American donors who suffer from the move of factories to low-income countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs after World War II.
We are a builder nation, we must rebuild!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also pledged to ease the status of working families.
On Thursday, Sanders said that the rich should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a taxpayer, it has to pay the exit tax, Clinton said.
Currently, he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“As president, I oppose any trade agreements that operate against workers or wages,” Clinton said.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton’s speech, Clinton was planning to criticize the Republican economic program announced by Donald Trump on Monday for “encouraging only such millionaires.”
Trump’s proposal for a ruthless reduction in corporate taxes, Clinton has previously called “Trump’s Porcelain Deal.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small businessman.
He reminded listeners of the small businessmen whose bills Trump has left unpaid, and the clothes that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start making products himself in America,” Clinton said.
These are Rio’s spectator figures: The races have not glued Finnish boxes, but the mobile app is of interest
Sporting events are usually seen in TV viewers’ statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have yet to reach a bleak audience.
At the same time, the competitions have attracted 12 per cent of the population at their best: on Tuesday night, the swimming was followed by 615 000 spectators on the Yle Olympic Channel at the same time.
For comparison: a month ago, the European general sports championships had almost 800,000 spectators on TV2, and the European football championships were fairly another million.
So far, the most interested of the Olympics has been cycling on Sunday afternoons and the fifth day of the race, which both reached nearly half a million spectators on the Olympic channel at the same time.
Yerevan sports chief Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the spectator figures, and reminds that the spectators will be divided into several different instruments for the first time at the Rio Olympics.
In addition, the Finns will be watching the Olympics in Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how much television viewers choose the Olympics in general.
On both sides of the TV, viewers share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports to which Yle has owned the entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are all the time from 20,000 to 500,000, then it’s a good base.
The number of spectators is less than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference explains the time difference – a large part of Rio’s performances will come in Finland at night.
The second reason for his lean interest - if it is now considered a lean one - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the initials, the interest would have pumped up with it.
In addition, public sports are just beginning, as are other Finnish species of interest: sailing and horse riding.
The initial number of spectators, according to Pokkis, was near-expected.
When the sport starts, spectator numbers explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for competitions, which in the first days of the competitions became the most downloaded free app in Finland on the Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I bet we're already running 200,000 downloads now.
"We will only receive the spectator numbers of the network later," says Pokkinen
Rio Arena has not worked for all users as expected.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
The Rio Arena has been subject to a delay and other minor technical problems in its early stages.
There are updated versions of the apps that should be corrected for errors.
The Rio Olympics will be seen in the Yle canals and arena more broadly than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can be monitored by some species, and on the radio Yle Speech transmits competitions daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the hardest to work Yle ever, but also the last to be watched only on Yle’s channels.
Beginning in 2018, Olympic sports will be shown on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is Finland’s deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänje, with a depth of 95.3 meters.
It might be even deeper.
Technician diving instructor Matti Kannela found a pressure gauge of about 20 square meters at Kristiselä, at the bottom of which the diving computer showed a depth of 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to reinforce the finding by eliminating consumption.
The method may not necessarily be found at a small depth of one hundred meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inarij (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Lake Päääjärvi are more than 80 meters wide.
They have not been studied as closely as the Journal.
In particular, the base of Lake Inarija has not been accurately mapped.
"There might well be unknown depths," Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by the medium depth, it is Great Lake Jukaj, 23 meters.
In this way, your Day will not reach the ten deepest groups and Suvaswater will be even farther from the top.
Repair on August 12 at 14:29: Fixed the last piece, where the deepest lakes of their central depth were wrong.
Taxation: Pensioners’ Taxation Is Still Harder
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than the taxpayers.
Ihalinen says that the deficiency emerged under parliamentary elections and pensioners were promised to pay equal to the employees.
This is not included in the Government’s proposal.
In our view, that should be absolutely the case.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he told Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, workers were given a reduction in their earnings, which eased taxation.
The matter was heated up in the parliament by opposition representatives, who stifled the then-Financial Minister Alexander Stubbia (cook.) on the election promises.
Purchase power is secured, it does not grow
In the line presented by Finance Minister Petteri Orpon (co.), according to Ihalines, tax cuts are mainly about securing the purchasing power and not increasing it, because next year there will be no increase in wages.
He says that tax cuts have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment, if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Orpo on the desire to respect the competitiveness agreement.
He said that sticking to the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy activity of the government period.
It has been done by the labour market organisations, so it should not be questioned by questioning.
It comes in need, because the economy is so much in the power of domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Long-term unemployment in the wake of
Ihalainen appeals to the government that it should catch up with long-term unemployment in the budget line, at least to stop its growth.
In June, there were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed than a year earlier.
He says that if growth doesn’t stop, the government’s goal will be to increase the employment rate to 72 percent.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is overlooked, there will be a very large social decline.
Embassy in Thailand: No Finnish casualties reported in attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The Embassy calls on Finns in the country to be vigilant and to avoid the busiest tourist areas, as well as to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions for caution should be followed, Westphale said.
There are very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The travel season for Finns in Thailand is scheduled for the season.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to target the Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to get information on the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
Overall, everything seems to be fine, Westphale says.
No information on the author
Westphalen said there was no information on the perpetrator of the attacks.
The ambassador believes the events could be linked to the political turmoil of a divided society in Thailand and the last week’s referendum on the constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were detained who said they were opposed to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, an ethnic-national conflict linked to the Muslim population, Westphale says.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
However, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations in the past.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
She said the city celebrates the Queen’s Birthday and Mother’s Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The attacks affect the course of the day in such a way that the authorities are very precise about security.
Thailand Police: Attacks do not involve international terrorism
According to police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been excluded, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand in a 24-hour period after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including tourist-favorite Phuket and Hua Hin.
At a popular tourist destination for Finns, the holiday island of Phuket exploded four bombs at night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require deaths.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, injuring one person, according to the newspaper.
A popular tourist destination in Hua Hin, in turn, according to local authorities, has exploded a total of four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one of them died in both bombs.
In South Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than and in the city of Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also known to many tourists as it transports to Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Nganin and Ko Tao holiday islands.
The perpetrator of the attack is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the Thai-run military junta, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not let people panic any more, he told reporters.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the intention of the perpetrators was to destroy the country’s tourism because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges the Finnish people in the country to be vigilant and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphale said.
Injured Europeans
Very little is known about the attacks during the night in Finland and their victims so far.
A little bit more information about the attack in Hua Hin last night has been provided.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the injured are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
In Hua Hin's second attack, at least three people were injured.
Two bombs exploded in the vicinity of the clock tower.
Thai PBS says police have isolated the area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
The Surat Thann bomb was hidden in a flower bank, according to the governor of the county.
One day, a local employee died.
There are at least one injured.
A CNN spokesman said two bombs, which exploded every half an hour, were also used in the attack on Surat Than.
According to the Bangkok Post, bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.

Thailand’s Finnish entrepreneur: “Everyone has no impact on tourism”
Established in Thailand’s Phuket real estate agency and children’s toy club, Esa Huovila is not worried about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more strikes, then I don’t think there will be any more wonder, as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia estimates that you have been working in Huovila for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies experienced in Thailand close by.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If they haven’t deported tourists in the past, that’s hardly the case.
The office of the company Huovila is located a few hundred meters away from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called around 9 a.m. local time and said it wasn’t worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach and main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They believed that the roadblocks had been set for the Queen’s birthday, Huovila says and refers to a holiday in Thailand on Friday.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
A lot of people on the beach hadn’t even heard of the attacks.
At half time three a day in Thailand, traffic in Patong had normalized and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who visited the site of the attack.
The car was later seen in Kruunupyyy at Jouxholmin Road.
When the police arrived, the car was on fire.
The battalion found two men fit for emotion while hiding in a nearby hemisphere.
The other man was immediately arrested.
The other escaped, but the man was later found in the forest with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage of a motor vehicle.
The police thanked those who gave the clues.
Director of Research on Changes in Leadership in Russia: Clear Dismissal
In Russia, the highest-ranking change of leadership was made on Friday in the years when President Vladimir Putin expelled Sergei Ivanov, the head of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is a former diplomat and served as Ivanovi's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov’s separation may be Putin’s desire to prevent the strong people around him from accumulating too much power.
He adds that recycling leadership tasks is one way of using power.
This is a way of preventing people from exercising power independently of the President.
It is also possible that Ivanov has been involved in or misled by other executives, according to the fabric trail.
Asemanpudotus Ivanoville
Ivanov, who belongs to Putin’s inner circle, is moving on to special tasks for the environment and transport.
With a tape presented by the state media, Putin said the change to a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to move to other positions and proposed Vaino in his place, Russia Today said.
Ivanovi’s point of view is that this is a clear misstatement.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in the order of importance in Russia.
He notes that Ivanov has been one of the most important people on the summit of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President’s Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev was elected president.
Canvas strip notes that the old card, for example, governors, has been exchanged in Russia recently.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi of the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanovi's place is that Putin is changing his neighborhood to younger.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields when retreating in Syria
They used civilians as human shields as they fled to the city of Jarabulus to prevent us from targeting them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij military council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters seized about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
It is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected from the previous news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously we mistakenly told that civilians were fleeing the city, actually ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians while fleeing the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's documentary publication is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s line of publicity of documents is illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that the documentary publicity cannot be based on the authorities' own lineages, but it is based on the law.
In the past, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over the Minister’s list of attendees to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with the guidance of the State Council’s chancellor and the fact that the information was included in the minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Head of Communications of the Ministry told the STT that there was a need for reform in the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio
As in the past few years, Bolt has been running against time.
He had to leave behind the Olympic Bears of Jamaica for the first time.
This hasn’t been the perfect preparation, but I’m in much better shape.
I've practiced well and that's the key," Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed Saturday dancers and fan-made reporters.
Porina around Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when public sport has struggled with doping scandals and slippery interest.
Bolt's previous loss at the 2004 Olympics was in Athens, where he scored at the start of the 200 metres at a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that was slowed down by injuries and found your workout.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, with which he broke the world record and the confidence of his competitors in spite of the final celebration of 9.69.
This is more difficult.
A year later at the World Cup in Berlin, Bolt achieved his career at the legal point on the clock.
The world records born in Berlin at 9.58 m and 19.19 m are still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that it is aiming for a 200-meter world record and a 19-second low, but no one believes it was born except Bolt himself.
The biggest challenger of the 100 Bolt is the Athens 2004 Olympic 100 winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year, in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt hasn’t lost in the finals of the championships once, if only he’s made his way.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th World Cup final was left out of Bolt due to a scam.
Bolt will be 30 in a week.
He's an old man in the young men's race, and the Rio races are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the next year’s World Cup in London as the last line of his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the rest.
I'm older and it's harder.
But every time I’m under, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals of Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, 18-year-old Chinese lawyer Chen Xinyi has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese investigator Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of illegal substances.
Bulgarian drinker Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan general sports coach was passported home because he gave a doping sample for the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo-hormone.
She was ranked fourth in the women’s 100-metre butterfly race in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese lawyer has brought his doping case to the International Sport Court of Appeal CAS.
Xinhua says a sample given by Xinyin on Sunday had found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There are other doping suspects in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian women’s boxer Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo-hormone.
Kenya has moved from Rio to the home of a sports coach due to a doping strike.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had been tested as an athlete and had given a doping sample for it.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan high-speed coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he used Ferguson Rotich's 800-metre race pass in the situation.
Nothing stops Phelps - historical gold came to the screen style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, American Michael Phelps, swims in a 200-metre mix in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve the same kind of Olympic gold in four consecutive races.
Phelps' win time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino was second in the mix before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs at Ittalhehde's quick interview.
The story of Helen Skelton on Monday is the most read this week on the website of Ittalehde.
Next up is Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't feel much stressed if there's a little bit of a glimpse of his revealing and special habits in the Somme or the British press.
TV is a visual medium, he stresses.
Skelton has worn high-heeled shoes and a short-sleeved dress that certainly has at least enough disclosure – at least for many conservative British fans.
However, rear steps are not allowed.
It's important to look good, and small judgments are just a funny thing.
Skelton certainly wants to play and perhaps abuse, but he stresses that he doesn’t want to be in the lead role.
It’s not about me, he says.
We're watching sports here, and the focus needs to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter as much as I'm dressed.
Can you imagine that the slope has gone up to Finland?
I can't, but all that focuses on how hard these swimmers do their jobs and how big the sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skelton whispered.
You know what?
It is rather empty when it comes to (the seller) dressing.
I'm a little curious if this has hit someone.
Police in Rio de Janeiro arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism
Rio's police said on Thursday it had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety surveillance of the contests.
At the same time, the police made five other arrests and interrogated two people before they were released.
All the suspects were Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, the detainees for terrorism are part of the same group that the police had already detained in July.
The detainees are believed to have connections with ISIS.
The detainees were known to have lit up violence on social media.
Inviting messages of violence were circulated, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of Rio.
Police detonated a suspected package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty court on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball court and closed the place to the public.
The police allowed the public to enter after the package had exploded in a controlled manner.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police had carried out a controlled explosive mission.
Police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The crowd came in after the police had controlledly exploded the package.
The audience did not predict the show by the start of the match, as the police closed the arena due to a suspicious package found in the castle.
The police exploded the packet and reached the public hall only after that.
The bag aroused the race to the Spanish team, which had started in a dream.
With two losses, Spain won Nigeria 96-87.
In the previous two competitions, Spain won silver.
The police carried out a controlled explosive mission for the third time during the Rio summer wars.
Last Saturday, police were forced to detonate a suspected discovery near the scene of road cycling.
Spain and Nigeria began their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in front of the empty spectators.
Argentine lady chuckles Petejja-Sireni - Finnish thought protest
Wind Petäjä-Sireni had a colorful race day in Rio.
The wind of Petäjä-Siren was hard on Thursday.
An Argentine lady kicked off the wind of Petejja-Sireni on Thursday in Rio at the opening day of the women's surfing day.
The wind was clearly violated.
The opponent admitted the breach.
He was left behind because of the collision, and others fled, Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius told reporters.
The athlete was thinking about protesting for a long time.
It was not worth doing, because it would have been futile according to the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water in order to get a refund, Mr. Siren said.
The Finnish was on board until the last time, because he did not want to get into the dirty waters of Rio.
The Finnish left with the collar when he left for 27th place.
In total, the London 2012 Olympic silver medalist is eighth.
The collision in relation to the particles did not affect much.
Friday is an important day when there are race departures from 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 Special Things That Extend Life According to Science
Science has explored everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring additional years into a person’s life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health in such a way that his or her life is prolonged.
Sometimes things that a person can’t influence themselves can bring him extra years.
Such are, among other things, the tendency to medium-term obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong your lifespan.
You don't always have to crush it - just picking up a milkshake is enough.
The secret of longevity has been explored through a number of different studies.
The Medical Daily presents seven of the strangest research results.
According to science, all of these things could lead to more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a “decreased risk of death,” especially with regard to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Alcohol research suggests that one to three daily doses of alcohol can prolong lifespans.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of toothpaste can extend a person’s life by up to six years, according to one study.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents pneumonia.
They can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughter has affected a person’s life.
The project, which lasted seven years, was attended by more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35% more likely to survive the test after the trial.
Sex, where protection from sexual intercourse has been taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition to everything, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have additional years in his life, he must also have an orgasm.
There will be more years of mobility, there will be no denying it.
Achieving a long life, however, does not require absolute stamina.
In fact, a study by the University of Oxford found that women with a large back side had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
Whether it was an Olympic medalist who became an athlete or an Oscar-winning actor, he is more likely to live longer than a regular poodle.
A lot of research has tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation might be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life to years.
Some researchers suspect that long life is the result of a person’s social status – which, in turn, enables, for example, the pursuit of recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviors for over 65-year-olds found that a person who shops daily is less likely to be a parent who shops.
This is because spinning in specific trades reduces loneliness.
It has once again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that can prematurely kill.
So count the credit card off your hand - online shopping games will therefore not have the same effect.
A steering wheelbase spilled into a truck
Varsinais-Suomen Koske on Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car crashed.
The accident took place in Koskela, between the contacts and Sorvastonia on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car had been driven on the same track, hitting the truck at the right angle.
After the collision, the truck remained upright on its ribbon, but burned.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car was sitting in the hallway and then across the hallway to the roof.
A woman who was born in 1972, who was driving a passenger car, was put under compression in her car.
The rescue agency removed the injured driver from the car, and he was transported to the main hospital of the University of Turu.
The result of the woman's breath test was 2.02 promille.
He's suspected of drunken driving.
The postman sent the landfills to the wrong city.
K-CityMarket’s sewerage range was flawed because the mail had accidentally delivered some of the cargo to the Wall.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Pernion, was on Thursday shopping for dishes from Salon K-Citymarket when a fun cold hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product shortcomings in the debris because Posti delivered our cargo to the Wall!
We'll get more when the Post gets the delivered cargo!
If you don’t have a lawn mower, read it in the field.
The success of the dealer is due to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowers.
The lawn mower is available at Post until the end of August.
Haltia thought the show was mostly interesting and he decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update hit me in a whirlwind.
Media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention raised to this is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia’s update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorite shoveled in a waste bag, even though a few plates were empty.
Mr Jaakko Kaidesoji, responsible for the business of Transportation Services at the Post Office, apologized for the damage done to Itta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stages were mistaken yesterday in the wrong place (Seinääjoki) and we no longer went to make a partial delivery (Saloon) by three, but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Itta-Sanom.
He was the first to report on the evening.
Teija Haltia was not upset by the rice, because she found all of her favorites from the selection.

Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of a life change.
Lotta shared a photo of her change on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was on the bumpers and your star was a normal weight.
Lutta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund began her weight loss cycle in 2009.
She is a complete lifestyle change and she lost a little quietly thirty pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted his amazing performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years in her appearance.
The Backlund before and after pair has collected several thank-you comments from interchangers.
You're great.
We are on the same path, motivation hard! one shines.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project Let's Do It Now.
I get a lot of power and excitement from your pictures while the sky itself is on the same path, the other tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped her last pounds. Let's do it now.
At that time, he told Ittelhehde that he wanted to finally get to a normal weight, which was then a 10-pound journey.
Over the course of three months of exercise, the pounds finally fell by five.
Family Wishes of Woman Murdered in Loviisa: Victim's Memory for Police Dogs
The 42-year-old woman’s family, who was murdered in Loviisa a week ago, hopes that the victims will be remembered instead of flowers and addresses with a donation to police dogs.
The Sipoo Veterinary Office has released a Facebook update, in which it conveys the victim’s family’s wishes for donations to police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked at the Sipoo Veterinary Station as a substitute and had also carried out her nursing training there.
The veterinarian reminds me of a woman with words that touch her.
Pleasant, smart, humorous and working fearless.
A good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation funds in their entirety go to police officers, primarily for the procurement of security guards.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home in Loviisa Koskenkyle.
The woman's neighbors have said that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flowers.
The 27-year-old suspect did not know the woman and they had no connection with each other.
The killer was accompanied by a police dog named Börje, who was wounded in a life-threatening detention situation.
However, the startle survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Post for violation of the Equality Act
The Post did not have the right to retain the salary of an employee who refused to familiarise the tenant, the district court assessed in its judgment.
The County Court obliged Post to pay the employee the majority of the detained salary and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the verdict, Post could have detained only a part of the family prosecutor's salary, which was responsible for the part of the whole day's work.
According to the district court, the employee was placed in a disadvantaged position on the basis of his trade union activities, contrary to the Equality Act.
The employee had adhered to the Union for Postal and Logistics on the organisational decision of the PAU on the ban on familiarisation.
In November last year, during a postage stamp, the PAU decided that the Post employees were not aware of the strike against rented workers.
It was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey's return to respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic development and respect for human rights, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (P.S.) in his response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter earlier, the Federation of Journalists asked Cipilä and Sonia to express their concern for Turkey’s freedom of speech and press.
Sipilä and Soini repeatedly point out to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and of expression.
Putin Separates Chief of Administration - Replace the Estonian-backed Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has resigned President Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin said.
Anton Vaino, the grandson of the Soviet-Estonian Communist leader Karl Vaino, will be replaced.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy head of the presidential administration since 2012.
He will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, according to the Interfax news agency.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration’s chief.
According to the Kremlin, Ivanov, a member of Putin’s close circle, is moving on to special tasks for the environment and transport.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to move to other positions and proposed Vanoa to replace him, Russia Today said.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanovi to be Putin's successor in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev was elected president.
Ivanov was appointed to office in 2011 before Putin was re-elected president in 2012.
BBC: ManU's massive acquisition for game ban - not seen at the opening of the Champions League
The world record player of football transfers will not be seen on the field when the England Cup is kicked off at the end of the weekend.
Paul Pogbang's career was followed by England.
Manchester United's leftover acquisition, Paul Pogba, will be on ManU's side due to a game ban opening his league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC said on Friday.
ManU paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million from Pogba to the Italian company Juventus.
However, the English football association FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba has been banned from Juventus.
He received two warnings in last season’s Italian Cup, and it becomes a one-match game ban.
The ban was transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next match will be in the league's second round on August 19, where ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, greatness is good.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have consolidated the Flow Festival’s status as an internationally recognized event, marked by the world’s top artists.
The Flow Festival starts Friday in Helsinki.
Festival visitors have typically expressed themselves in self-described dresses.
One of the main characters this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival’s event area is decorated with artwork and art installations, among others.
It has never been enough for us to have only a masterpiece and a tent, says artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Helsinki’s Suvilah this weekend has grown from a small card life festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
In the background of success, there is a simple question: what kind of event would the perpetrators themselves want to go to?
It’s a bit different in the event productions to think like this.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be sold out again this year.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors to 70,000 by 5,000 last year.
This year, the festival will be attended by a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because it has to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we don’t want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, guided by huge roads.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of the successful event has been refined over the course of 13 years, with 130 performers, art installations, as well as numerous restaurants and drink bars in the part of the area.
In addition to the main table and the smaller showcases, this year a tent of 15,000 people will operate as a venue.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little big, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow alive.
If you lose it, it's not our business anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for Kallio’s work is that today even big visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, the activity was highly dependent on the support of the city of Helsinki of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20,000.
Last year, Flow had a turnover of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million.
It can lead to "circumstances" such as the construction of a 73-meter-wide tent.
Visitors to Flow have typically expressed themselves in self-described dresses.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
First and foremost, we want to stand out in content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s value world: curiosity and a desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main characters is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge crowd of fans in his own genre, but he doesn’t have indie rock, pop music, rap and soul combining festivals, he has the most typical performances.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time she will be seen in Finland.
We are all interested in history and the future.
Not just what is being played on the commercial radio.
Iggy's last album is damn good, and he's been doing damn good plays in the last few years.
Thailand's tourist parade bombs were hidden in bouquets - tourists fled in terror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At times, at least one local woman died and over 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower basket and exploded with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were exploded at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran told CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife conservationist living in Asia, tweeted a high-speed picture of the attacks in 1989.
If the tweet doesn’t look good, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
The crowd ran up against me and said the bomb exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest barricades, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladett.
The next morning local time exploded two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Shortly thereafter, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, also favored by the Finns.
I don't think anyone's dead.
At the same time, another double bombing was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were injured.
A bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet been able to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, there may also be criminal organizations involved.
According to Aftonbladet, police have recently been harassed by human trafficking organizations.
KSML: This part of the new armour will go to battle in a war situation first
In the acute war situation, troops are ordered to combat missions only after several months of sworn military ceasefire, says Central Finland.
According to Jukka Sonnisen, the head of training of the Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, for example, of the military personnel serving for 5.5 months in a war situation, only those who are at the end of their training are eligible for combat.
According to the head of training, the service is first assigned to the reserves belonging to the preparedness teams.
There is no command from a battalion or reserve to a mission that has not received the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer it was revealed that the Defence Forces will begin training men in units of immediate readiness from next year.
Units can be used in military operations as required already during the training of the military.
Pamela Tola received gigantic compensation from homestay
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough dispute over the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The retail price of the two-layer separate list was EUR 330 000.
After the trade, however, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused a health-threatening microbial plant.
The couple was forced to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132,000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198,000.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both court and court courts.
The court ruled the case on Wednesday.
It maintained a district court ruling ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150,000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse the costs of litigation and settlement of the couple for a total of EUR 47,344.
The court reasoned the price reduction a bit, because some of the repair needs of the apartment had already been known to buyers at the time of making the home purchase.
However, according to the Court of Justice, the apparent construction errors were substantially more serious than what was presented.
Tola looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically searched for well-established homes because they did not want to take up repairs.
He had the idea that the building was fundamentally repaired and in good condition and that the factors mentioned in the conditional inspection report were not affected.
The conditional inspection report referred to risk and inadequacy of ventilation and the inadequacy of rain and melting water management along the rocky surface.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it did not appear that this was a matter of any urgency.
Tola and Waroma agreed that the rainwater coming from the rock should perhaps be guided a bit in a few years’ time.
Trades were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the moisture problems in the apartment were likely to be much more serious.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 found a microbial plantation in the building, which, according to witnesses, resulted from both the rock’s rainwater and the capillary rise in the soil.
The air contaminated by microbes on the west side of the house, according to the inspector, could also reach the interiors through the debris.
A possible risk to health, exceeding the limits, was found in the sweeping samples of the home care room, the cellar staircase, the windows of the living room and the laundry room.
Terraces were built without permission
The court also disputed whether the apartment was expanded against the building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the city of Espoo’s decision that the apartment had been changed against the permit before trading.
Among other things, the terraces were built, although there were no proper permits yet.
However, home problems were a key issue in the courtroom.
According to the court, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the transaction, the buyers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma did not consider the Court of Justice to have any particular reason to carry out a larger inspection than usual.
Purchasers have not neglected their securities obligation, the court states in its judgment.
Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for the Nazis - in the register also the Finnish
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in a recent Dagens Nyheter article that the National Archives of Maryland, U.S.A., has recorded documents on microfilms for a total of 218,500 women, all wanting to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
At least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finns and 31 Swedish women were also wanted as Nazi memorials.
Documents and registration cards are from a breeding agency operating in Nazi Germany.
The Rotuvirasto operated under the authority of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man was allowed to have children in Nazi Germany until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same applies even more to women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were performed on women to clarify the matter.
The Rotuvirasto examined women’s backgrounds by studying church books, among others.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the family.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the breeding agency handwritten resumes as well as good recommendations from loved ones.
The breeding agency wanted assurances that women were "children's", "savings" and "good national socialists" who knew very well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The story does not tell us what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program, known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
The programme, among other things, stipulated that every SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside it.
The Lebensborn households take care of children born outside of marriage and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, according to the pages of the American Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The honorary crown of the German mother was awarded to women who had given birth to at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, according to the museum's pages.
Sixth of the Pirate Sir, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was ranked third in the first departure on the day of the Finnjolli sailing at the Olympics in Rio, but left the whole crowd on the second departure of the day.
Nirkko rose to eighth overall after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought 17th and 3rd in RS:X-Class departures.
In total, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470s, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren placed 23rd in the opening run of the day.
In total, Lindgren is 19th.
Jari Sillanpää Satulinna was recorded a couple of hours at night: "I was so bored"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the favourite Finnish artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who became Finland’s best-selling solo artist and the star of dancers and festivals from the cruise ship’s bar to the tango of 1995, is able to continue to grow and is currently in a rough upturn.
The book, written by Mari Koppisen, about the life of the favorite singer Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, was published on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells of his life and career in both good and bad.
Bridgehead's career rose to a real ascent when he won the tango crown at the Tango Market of Seinäjoen in 1995.
In the cat, Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece on behalf of Sillanpää, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
Satulinna became one of the most popular pieces in Finnish music history.
The book tells us that the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang on the tape in a terrible crapule and only a few hours after the night’s sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so pissed!
The head of the bridge remembers in the book.
A huge hit from the collection of a hit song would not immediately be thought to have been sung in crappy.
Although I wasn’t physically at my best, the track was still good.
I’ve learned that I don’t always have to demand perfection and excellence.
Another incident related to the man’s most popular tracks, which is told in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää divorced from her partner at the time, and the event ended with the lyrics of You earn gold, which were released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the words of the song ordered by Saara Törmäss were not the kind of song that Sillankopf would have liked.
Bridgehead had imagined himself making a record telling the true story of his own life, but the words of the differential song were not true, but it was written based on the news of the 7 Days magazine.
Jari's divorce from his ex-girlfriend was reported in the newspaper's news about Jari's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was full of puppets and did not hold true.
According to the book, Jari played in his anger with the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and good so.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Eventually, 52% of voters voted for the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though polls in voting week predicted the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their position to remain in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university voted for the distinction, even though a couple of individual researchers were allowed to disagree with the vast flow of their professions.
The theme house of former U.S. President Bill Clinton’s recent election campaign, “It’s the economy, stupid” flew into the rubble during the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Category: Economical language
The Centre for Macroeconomics, in its latest monthly survey, has tightened its professional responses to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not heard because this time voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for economists’ loss of economic status is that people don’t understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, i.e. almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's from the UK.
Many also have the idea that declining the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
According to economists, voters did not believe in economic arguments because the consensus of economists did not come up enough.
They were particularly haunted by the equality of the BBC, which gave just as much room to economists who represent only a few percent of the economics of the EU as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic capacities combinations would think of the consequences of the difference.
Those remote combinations of letters spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, public debt and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both heard and understood, then they were not conveyed, because economists represent an elite with whom the voters do not think they have any common interests.
Academics in big cities like economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small cities and in rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is an economy
The overwhelming victory argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant pushes your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments slipped.
In every cafe there are foreign employees.
How much more jobs would there be in the UK if they left?
In the waiting room of each health centre, there are immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical appointments if they didn’t?
In every school, there are children of immigrants.
How much easier would the right British children get a place of school if they were rid of them?
In every city there are foreigners.
How much more space would there be indigenous peoples if they disappeared?
In my opinion, these are economic issues.
They relate to jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists did not succeed in responding to them, and if they succeeded, their answers did not get visibility.
Economists have failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the UK has more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are the net payers of the UK's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund Prepares for Brexit Cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, which is responsible for real estate investments by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said that Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, or EU-wide dividend camp, began to be prepared more precisely a few weeks before the vote in the event that the result would be a leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds usually do not have a large amount of liquidity, but now they may be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquidity, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen’s only open-ended property fund on a day-to-day basis.
According to the old, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The fund was worth <0xC2><0xA3>3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company’s funds is about <0xC2><0xA3>20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all UK real estate funds open real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at ten percent or even below.
The Real Estate Funds are therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The Funds Closed the Trade
When the EU-winning camp won, Europe became confused.
However, the few weeks that followed the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
There were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, the CEO of the Bank of England, in which he assessed that Brexit could pose a high risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
These together plundered the situation and raised the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared in 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained quieter, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started to roll, and the foundation had to close its doors one after the other.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash accumulated, but it also had to finally freeze its trading for six days.
According to the old, they did not actually close trade, but changed prices down.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it would be worthwhile to pull out the money in panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would cause losses.
It calmed the situation, and most cancelled the announcement.
Since then it has been quite flat, and now the market has been a couple of weeks very calm, the old says.
He notes that, for example, the Aberdeen Continental European Funds have not had any similar meltdowns.
There were a lot of questions, however.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
According to the old, the closures of the trades of real estate funds have received a disproportionate amount of attention.
The open funds covered by the closures control about four per cent of Britain’s property.
The Aberdeen shutdown lasted six days, and the company sold out less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some of the other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds in the middle of 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been downwards, but the situation does not appear to be "more pronounced" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British public economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has given some real estate investors even new opportunities, notes Vanhanen.
The Punjab and the dollar rate is at its lowest for 30 years, plus the market has a 15% discount on sales compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of buyers, the old man says.
Brexit Brings Mines to London Real Estate Market
At two o’clock in the morning, the situation didn’t seem very different.
But at four o’clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, the real estate investment manager of the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's what you got.
I realized that this is now going to plan B, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He went to work right away.
London City was already fully alive in spite of the morning.
The TV channels normally set to be silent in the office gave the news back, and usually the loud crowd was completely silent to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to report his departure.
When the market opened, the display ends flashed just red.
It was a morning that you would never have believed to live, says the old man.
It is not because, in spite of the mist, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate trades on the day after the Brexit vote.
The feeling was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and therefore the situation was somewhat calm, says Vanhanen.
Brexit Vote Starts Correctional Movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The point collapsed, the British leadership switched.
The markets began to anticipate sharp declines in the real estate market in Britain and in particular in London.
London’s offices were projected to fall by as much as 20% in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trades one after the other.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the ants have fallen, but in the air still there is uncertainty.
However, it does not appear to be the last summer holidays this week in the face of the Old Man who spent in Helsinki.
It is still too early to say much about what will happen to Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference is happening and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The developments in the London real estate market have already been identified.
The CBRE data on price developments of the real estate service company covers about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3% from June to July.
In London’s City office buildings, the minus increased by 6.1 per cent, according to Vanhanen.
The numbers aren't so terrible, but they're monthly changes.
Monthly indexes began to be published in 1987, and in just five months there have been worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All equally significant drops occurred in the years of crisis 2007 and 2008.
Interestingly enough, Brexit was quickly compared to the collapse of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began from the US real estate market.
The old man thinks that the comparison is not exactly right, because it is now a British domestic crisis.
There's another feeling.
The real estate market has now seen no such panic sales at the time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
Funding is also normal.
Corrections could have been ahead in any case.
In fact, the price adjustment movement is not a miracle for him - it could have been that way without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen, the prices of properties in London and other major cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
The loss started at a very high level.
London's prices have been upwards for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown sharply, the population of London as well.
Another major trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is globalizing, says Olden.
New players have emerged from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investment destinations abroad.
London is known for its easy destination.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by a low interest rate, which is why, for example, pension companies have had to search for income from new items.
Loan on this has been readily available - although debt relief has now been used significantly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, the price rise was equal to last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen started to lighten his assets in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of reversal to be expected, and now it has come.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy evolves, the old says.
He doesn't dare to estimate the future, but he says that there's hardly any climbing peak.
Sensation indicates that there is a downward or steady passage ahead.
The old man has already seen several moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the cup will be solved by work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in a single market, there are too many victims.
If it is decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, says the Old Man.
S-Group starts registering purchase information more accurately than before
The S-Group knows what you’re eating, as my trading group announced today that it started collecting more detailed information about its customers’ purchases.
Once the final amount of the receipt has been collected so far, the group will start searching for the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S-Group will follow Kesko here, because the information on the goods purchased with the plus card has been collected in the Kesko customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the program has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have refused to use product information, Riitala tells Taloussanom.
According to him, Kesko will not react to the S-Group registration change.
Kesko already categorizes its customers according to the simple food purchases into ten groups.
The rating is updated monthly.
Customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase information is collected only from the K-Group's own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not disclose their information.
Lidl Finland has no customer support program and does not have any plans for this item.
The Finnish Neighborhood has its own First-Bonus customer program, which can be joined in the Selection Houses, Siwos and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect information about product or product category levels, we will remain at the final amount of the receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made in the store and the day and the final amount of the customer receipt.
We have not gone to the same level as the K-group or the S-group,” says commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, the customer support programme is to be further reformed, but Neighborhood Trade will tell you about it later.
Ora, however, does not allow the registration of product information.
Initially the experiment
So far, SOK’s customer and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information included the profession, education, form of residence, and the years of birth of children and previous personal information.
Individuals belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, the place, the final amount of purchases and the payment method are stored on the S-Etucard purchase.
In addition, information from S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will begin to be deposited in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prisms, Home Terriers and ABC chains, data is recorded at product category level for the time being.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more closely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partnership at SOK.
The S-Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in the cash register anyway, whether you want it or not.
You can check your stored information on the S-Group website.
For example, the cash registers do not have access to the data, Saarikoski stresses.
Video: Heila-pentu is Zoll's newest dog confirmation - puppy becomes first explosive dog
The black labrador puppy sharply squeezes five boxes of similar land in a row at Helsinki-Vantaa airport.
It doesn’t take long when it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog for playing it with his favorite film.
The box next to which Heila was sitting revealed a bottle of scented shells for the red gaze.
Rust gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of the Heila dog.
Security status and e-shop accesses
Heila is the first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives at Tull and will be placed to work at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport next year.
Work tasks may take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports as needed.
However, the airport will be Heila's main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels led to measures in Customs and after the attacks, controls have been strengthened, said Customs Supervisor Mikko Grönberg.
The second reason for training weapons and explosives cows in customs duties is through postal consignments through Helsinki-Vantaa.
With the growing internet trade, up to 40 million mails are being sent through the airport each year, including supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made a discovery of online shopping at Helsinki-Vantaa airport, including around 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their starting materials.
Heila will work on different sides of Helsinki-Vantaata.
It will investigate checked baggage and postage.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future, as it can pass through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the sound, Tulli will assess whether more weapons and explosive cows will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful of the idea.
Kirkkonummella School
Heila penn training is coordinated by the Tull dog school in Kirkkonummel.
Heila also trains with police and Defence Force experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decide what smells Heila is taught to recognize.
The sound will always be trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki-Vantala are Tullin’s six drug dogs and money and drug dogs Massi.
Labrador breeder Heila has been selected from ten puppies.
The selection criteria for a dog to choose from at the airport include crawling and hunting, as well as calmness, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion’s home, is a close friend of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
There's nowhere to go without Light at home, Suntio laughs.
The subtle commands go to Heila at once.
The Night-Samomi cameraman loses a bit of camera cover for a quick dog, but Heila returns the cover from a soft toy immediately from the "exit" command.
Hard Competition for Tools
The primary school will be completed next year.
There are still some basic tests ahead, next October, to assess whether training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen at work in Helsinki-Vantala next half of the year, if everything goes according to plans.
Unfortunately, passengers can’t come to squeeze a dog on the work slips, reminds Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year for customs.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they are retired to the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active portions last only from ten minutes to a few hours.
The owner of the working dogs is a tough competition in Tullis.
Approximately 20-30 employees of Customs were applied for as the owner of the cell.
Lucky hit Sunti, who has not had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs as well as supervisory tasks in Tulissa.
The mini-state gets its first Olympic medal – the people get a day off
Less than a million people in Fiji’s Olympic gold rugby is so high in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed the issue after the championship was resolved.
The day of rest will be held on the team's return the next day.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
The Fiji rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian reports that a final was followed in the capital Suva, where the stadium was screened.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard they were encouraging," Fiji Times reporter Michaele Seru told The Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish wreckage after performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt after a hard battle of 175 kilos.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after the lifting of the ribs, he has been rotted many times.
No one has ever been able to say why.
Tokola gained 175 pounds from work in Rio and 145 pounds from training.
His total result was 320 pounds.
Tokola attempted to gain 175 pounds in the end, as well as the other.
With the third company, the weights rose in a hurry.
The body whispered under the weights until the judge approved the lift.
The joy of the Finnish driver is that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Prosan - Veikkausliga - Itta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Palloseura, who plays in the men's football league, has signed a lasting deal with Estonian striker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player in our team, who has the power and the threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We’ve been through more than 50 players from all over the world with more than ten player agents.
Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen, said in a statement that he was a good choice.
Prosa, 25, comes to RoPS from Flora in Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian national team.
Prosan is expected to be with RoPS on Saturday at Seinäjo, where the Rovani people will face the SJK of the dominant Finnish champion.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's painter Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The Threat of Modern Family: Teen Star Shorts Reveal Almost Everything
Alex Dunphy, the kind acquaintance of the Modern Family comedy series, Ariel Winter is once again exploding by presenting his proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that do not leave much imagination behind.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also the back of this.
18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior to a much more bold one.
The star has posed in her social media posts with very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very thin suits.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has also recently released several photos of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
In this case, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was running a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a children's star to an adult.
He has been on television most of his life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more he looks like a surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has haunted some of his long-time fans with his image change.
It’s not hard to guess where she is in ten years’ time, as the downside is already rough, says one woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the women’s fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge her not to be critical.
You look gorgeous!
It doesn't matter what others say.
You are an inspiration to many women, a bright young woman.
Japanese prefer North America to Finland - tourists are attracted by stripes: Autumn is possible to see a haunted mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start revenge trips in early autumn, Visit Finland said in a statement.
The main destinations of Japanese recreational tourism are Inari and Levi.
Revolts are the power maps of our winter tourism, and they are strongly combined with the winter of the heart and snowy landscapes.
Lapland’s winter resort trips are very in demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn resort trips.
It is rare to know that the harvest season starts in early autumn and continues in the long spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the resounding, making the display twice as random, says Anne Lind, Marketing Manager of Visit Finland.
The main target group of the Finnish revolution campaign are the wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city, who dream of travel and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, among other things, by online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers from the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need more distinctive sights from Finland, and Lind said the area has a huge potential.
Overnight stays for Japanese tourists have increased significantly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they stayed in Finland more than twice as much as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in tourism in Finland as a target group, as they spent more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>80 million in Finland.
The average Japanese spent <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>183 a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain Satisfies Rugby Silver at Fid’s Masters Course to Lead to Gold
Britain's impressive progress in the rugby tournament crashed Fidz's last challenge in the final on Thursday night, after the team suffered 43-7 breakthroughs at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi held a master's course in handling, crushing, avoiding, supporting games, running shoes and silk in order to win gold - their first Olympic medal.
The loss was accompanied by a reasonable consolation of the silver medal – the third of the British Day – and they were proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby tournament, during which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Earlier on the same day, a tough 7-5 win in the semi-finals from South Africa might have bothered them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won in this condition even a top 15 team.
Britain may - but probably not - be comforted by the fact that at least one Briton has a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: the head coach of Fiji is Ben Ryan, former England boss of Wimbledon.
The trip to the UK has been quite easy.
Eight years ago, they were coached by Ryan and lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here, they lost only one.
This spinal cord hurts, but the development is stunning.
Fidi started to fight the British loopholes for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his teams, this was as if they were running buses running towards, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dives in the corner of the field.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwa's second touchdown on the right row led to a painting loss.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell’s brilliant tale stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from making his third goal, but it was only a slow one for Fid.
In seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner, and Britain were 17-0 losing.
Nakarawa again painted for a new start, and there was still more than a minute left in the clock... for the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvouou crashed through the loose cliffs of Britain and ran into the line to paint.
After the draw, the situation at the break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while the UK was just learning the game.
And that's how it really is.
The United Kingdom made a break of changes that blocked Fid’s path for a total of four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova made the goal after Fid’s impressive draw.
Dan Norton hit the UK with a touchdown in the left corner and narrowed the situation to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Atlantic Islanders, whose supporters sang, floated their flags and danced in the audience.
It was hard not to admire Fid’s cheerful approach.
Mata Viliame's last-minute painting was a corrosion in the Fidji cake, which did not require corrosion.
The pill was celebrated, the Fiddlers were harassed, and Britain fell to the grass, completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fidi had defeated Japan in the semi-finals 20-5, and Britain won South Africa in the tight semi-finals, where they both scored one goal - the British goalkeeper decided the game.
Kyle Brown led South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the painting area with an overwhelming footwork and made the painting under the painters in the second half.
A great late knockout from Marcus Watson, Anthony’s brother of England’s 15-aside rugby team, secured the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach's battle against cancer was fueled by Helen Glover and Heather Stanning's condolences
There will be no more emotion in these competitions than gold, and it really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard whistles to history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found deeper meaning in their golden moments at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they were concerned about the two, there were three voices on the boat. Coach Robin Williams' ankle was present all the time, when the two were competing in their consecutive Olympic women's competition - the first women in the history books of British sport to surpass this achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th unprecedented appearance, which is also a record.
This, what we see, two great athletes joining the surface of a coercive match, does not fully represent the nature of the win.
There is a group of hand-pair assistants who gradually promote the things that matter. And no hand-pair was as essential as the coach who did not know 30 months ago, after the diagnosis of cancer, if he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was accurate.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they did the surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
It changes a little bit your thinking.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third was fortunate that his treatment was able to begin at the beginning of 2014 outside of the season, when they caused as little disruption as possible - if it could ever be used in such situations.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the department - 20, 30, 50 feet at a time, when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Stimulating itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first thought of the couple was Williams, who had had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, the experienced captain of the Afghan command on the royal arts rhyme, said: "I've been tunneling this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just emphasizes how important this is to me, how hard Helen and Robin and I have worked, too.
The three years spent with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so he's got a big thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have imagined a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the competition in five years.
The couple set a tough rhythm that their competitors did not reach.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark started approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very stuck in the moment.
Helen shouted, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is very important to keep checks.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything special.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just trying to win a good match and win a race, and we did.
Couples wait a year before deciding their future.
Glover takes part in the wedding next month as he marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better,” he said.
Iceland to Replace Panama Leaked Government
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which are already being called for by protesters angered by Panama data leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day is now set for October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the people’s final anger affects the outcome of the autumn election.
In the June presidential election, criticism of the powerful was clearly shown, and out-of-political candidate Gudni Johannesson was elected president.
Trump says he was sarcastic about claiming Obama as the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has resigned from his last speech.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that President Barack Obama would be the founder of ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to form the organization.
The Democratic Party was angry at the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
The commander-in-chief of the army should never let anyone who can fall down like that, Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a popular Muslim-like burkini swimsuit on the beaches, reports the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that beaches and swimming are prohibited from anyone who does not have a good habit and a swimsuit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimming suits, which largely express religious connections, can increase the risk of disorders in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice, when a 31-year-old man drove the French National Day celebrations to the crowd.
At the end of July, two extremist organizations, connected to the Fathers, attacked the church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the swimming water in the area of Oulu will pass through the lake - Pykösjärväsammaa in Pykösjärv
Water samples taken from the official swimming beaches in the Oulu area meet the quality requirements for swimming water.
Only on the shore of Lake Pykösjärvi has been observed blue-leaf fatigue.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action in Oulu region took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public swimming beaches in the Oulu area.
With the exception of the seaweed beach, the concentrations of enterococci bacteria in E. coli and intestinal ponds of all swimming pools were below the operational limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci concentrations of seaweed bathing water were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial levels had been lowered below the operational limits.
The blue leafyness observed on the shores of Lake Pyk<0xC3><0xAB>s does not yet make the water unfloatable, but under favorable conditions, the situation can quickly turn into blue leafy leaf, forming a blue-green debris on the surface of the water.
The environmental action follows the situation with a tightened check.
In the event of a bluefin tunnel becoming a bluefin tunnel tunnel, the notification board shall also inform you separately.
See the results of the swimming water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen forest donation reduction: more than 80% of forest owners outside
Forest gift reduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance’s draft budget for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of the gift transfer tax for forestry.
In the proposal of the Ministry of Finance, forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote the generation of forest farms, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a reduction in the net capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generation of forest farms is good, commented Juha Hakkarainen, director of the Central Union of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (CFO).
However, Hakkkaren finds criticism of the tax evasion proposal.
Forest gift reduction is presented for the forest owner's net capital income.
It is a capital income from which all other deductions are deducted.
According to MTK and Hakkaraisen, the effect of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the results of the sale of the tree.
The VM’s proposal is based on a reduction in the net capital income of forestry, which prevents the loss of forestry capital income from being deducted from other taxation.
Such a person would get a tax benefit, even if they don't have a tree for sale.
The calculation model is inextricably complicated.
The average forest owner can't figure it out, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, he said, the model concerns only a small proportion of forest owners.
The limit for the tax reduction linked to the forest’s profit value is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
He thinks it's too high.
As such, he said, it would exclude 82% of Finnish forest owners from the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10 percent of the forest owners, he says.
The VM considers that the boundary guarantees the goal of growing up in space.
According to Hakkarasen, forest donation has been reduced in forest policy for decades.
It is based on the ageing of forest owners.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are retired.
Powerful racing shocked the drivers at Himanga - two cars crashed into the entrance and crashed into each other

In the back of the car were two people who were both transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident occurred on the highway 8 from Himangal Pradesh, a few kilometers to Kalajo.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research from researchers at the University of Turin can help to develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings of the academy professor Johanna Ivaska’s research team show that the hardness of the cancerous tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer was prevented in laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to match the normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and the surrounding tissue in the treatment, in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study were published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Mukherjee's family death continues in court, prosecutor demands murder sentence for another perpetrator
The death penalty for Muhok’s family continues in court for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for Muhok’s family death.
The other was sentenced to 8 years and 4 months for murder as a young person and brutal robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder as a young person and brutal robbery.
The executioner was also sentenced for endangering traffic safety as a young person and the right to transport a vehicle as a young person.
The court’s judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who received a more severe sentence.
The prosecutor demands that a man sentenced as a young person to 12 years in prison for murder.
They were at the moment in full understanding.
According to the court, 17-year-old boys killed a man in July last year who worked as the school’s child protection unit manager.
A 17-year-old convicted of murder allegedly attacked the driver sitting in the back of the living room on the couch.
The conductor had escaped from the excavation and had taken the young man to his room, when another young man hit him with a vacuum cleaner.
Among other things, the conductor was beaten, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the mental state study, both convicts were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape from family homes at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrae in the world, growing only at the age of 156
The world’s longest-lived vertebrate is a confirmed ice shark, according to a study published in Science magazine.
In the northern Atlantic, such as the floating glacier around Greenland, the Holker can live up to 400 years old.
The female is only growing at the age of 156.
Ice sharks live more because it grows only one centimeter a year.
Only one species of Simpu is known to live frostbites for longer.
Researchers found out the age with radiocarbons.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some oysters had radioactive residues.
Based on these, researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The oldest age was estimated to be 392 years - yet a throw in one direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump's Economics - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world.
Even a third of the country’s tax revenue would be excluded if the change to corporate tax led by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenues would also decrease, in particular with the richest tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary by presenting it in Detroit on Monday.
Corporate tax would drop from 35 percent to 15 percent.
Without collecting, it would be a really great sum of <0x24>1 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump’s 33.
The inheritance tax would be completely waived.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation of business and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental norms adopted by the breeders must be revised and the regulation in the energy sector must be abolished.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be taken into consideration.
The administration must appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats".
Trump’s “destructive” trade policy is one of the biggest causes of US problems.
Free trade agreements would be terminated.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty of 45 % and from Mexico a penalty of 35 %.
We offer a new future.
“Americanity, not globalism, is our religion,” Trump said.
Donald Trump’s America Doesn’t Need to Change the World
American cars come to drive on the streets, American planes to connect cities, American ships to watch at sea, American steel to lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
In contrast, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by his aides, even though well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - are seeing the U.S. take the Trump program to a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton announced her program early on Friday in Finland.
An Attack on the Past - People's News
The sea whispers fatefully, but the real storm strikes in the middle of Madrid’s street wall – whether accountability with the past can begin.
In short, it is the core of Pedro Almodóvar’s new story.
Almodóvar’s previous directorial work Matkarakastajat (2013) was a small-faced and rhetoric satirical comedy, preceded by The Skin in which I live (2011) at the peaks of the career of the Spanish violinist.
Levelly Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between these two works.
It is the interconnected bond of love, human relationship and family, at the center of which is the mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and can be seen as a long backstory.
Life seems to be modeled on the middle-aged nominee (Emma Suarez), but then everyone threatens to fade away.
In the aftermath of a casual encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) must be surprised to find out until the end of the film.
In the form of a backpack and a long letter, Julieta repeats the stages of her life to her adult daughter.
He starts from the time before his daughter was born, the moment he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta's second female lead is Adraina Ugarte, who plays as a young teacher in the television series Between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a boiler, but I would say that time is slow and word for word.
For Almodóvar films, there is often a fair distance in Julieta with such a characteristic brilliance, always with humor.
It is an equally well-played, distracted, a place with good music and a rather sad film with elements of elegance as such.
Instead, the typical visual luminosity of the Spanish driver is present and in such a way that it begins to put a little silence into the eye as a pure form rather than as a dramatic effect.
People in the film experience illnesses, deaths or just sudden losses, but the surface remains the same as Korean.
This is especially true for the infestation: in the case of a nominee, the dwellings change from scene to scene, and the same applies to the appearance of the earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing is that the descriptions of the scene are not particularly clear.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and a little indifferent.
Almodóvar has written a novel based on three novels by the Nobel laureate Alice Munro.
Novels have been published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat balanced literary filming.
The subjects would have been emotionally incomparable to the drama, as the theme of the leffa deals with the big things - especially the blatant guilt.
Written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on the three novels of Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first movie is 12.8.
The government is trying to vote - People's News
No new cuts will be made, the ministers insist, so that the basic Finns do not collapse completely.
In the spring, however, the cuts are done by the barber shop.
There will be no new surgery.
The <0x24>4 billion savings already made are sufficient.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (cook.) under the budget line convince.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, as the cuts in social security were decided already in the spring frame phase.
Children's allowances, national pensions, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to national pensions indexes will be reduced by 0.85%.
The duration of the unemployed person’s unemployment insurance is reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
The training cuts continue.
The Municipal Elections
Why do the ministers insist that there are no new cuts on these?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipal elections are held in April and they are the most important thermometer of the election season, not gallus.
In the past, it has been seen that the results of the municipal elections leading to different directions of the government parties have long been detrimental to the atmosphere of the government.
However, the Gallus report that the main Finnish government party expects a scoring loss, although the result of its previous elections was modestly 12.3 per cent compared to parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, Finns received 752 new delegates, many of whom will realize the price of influence in the right-wing government next spring.
The life-threatening role of a three-party government is in the hands of the Finns.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the voters got enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's rallies have also come to the surface.
The rhetoric does not allow new cuts, firstly, to obscure the fact that they will be made vigorously next year, and secondly, they will be attempted to soften the anticipated blow to the main Finns.
Big cuts in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different - if the Civilian government is still in a position.
The government has set the goal of indebtedness in this election period, but the budget proposal by Petteri Orpo will take <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5.9 billion in debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the election and admit that the government is unable to follow its own agenda: debt does not tilt or even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
This means even more severe cuts in the 2017 budget line for the former.
The budget would be balanced at least during 2018, and then in the spring parliamentary elections, what is coming will be welcomed.
These actions do not lead to debt
It is quite clear that the current actions do not lead to indebtedness, even if Juha Sipilä is trying to lighten the positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäe in the report on the budget are irreconcilable:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be optimistic, meaning that the international economy will not receive any appeal.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy exercised in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent over the decade, extending from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion more per year than it did in 2008.
The public debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What is Responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the Left League’s debt relief was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion, which is practically covered by taking on a completely new debt.
This is the central, meeting and basic Finns' perception of what is responsible.
Question: We want to leave a lot of work to the city
Three out of four believe that organizing child care, youth work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, according to KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation research.
The clear majority of the people will also assign responsibility to the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civil isotopes, building supervision, college education and waste management.
The responsibility of the county, in turn, is most clearly aimed at county care, specialist nursing, vocational education, vocational colleges and the institutional management of development disabilities.
None of the tasks in charge of the municipalities are intended to be delegated to the state.
A minor steering wheelchair runs backwards after police escape
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu fled the police force in Joensuu, Ilomantsintie, on Friday at half time.
The police tried to stop the motorcycle without lights for a while, but the young man left to drive the police away at a fair speed.
The trail continued to the Sonkajan coast, from which to the Sorronahonti and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove out of the road.
Even after that, the young man ran away, but a faster policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
The inhalation test for the driver showed 0.75 promille.
He also did not have a driver’s license that would have allowed him to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, inter alia, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck that was in the rocks crashed into the river
On Thursday night, at 9:15 p.m., the truck in Kivilast crashed into the Polvijärvi lake.
The truck had been driven to the left in a comfy map out of the road and fell to the edge of the village.
The rescue agency pulled the injured driver out of the crashed truck through a door above it, along with the rescue helicopter staff and first responders.
Lifting the vehicle was the responsibility of the owner.
The hydraulic oil that the rescuers put into the turbine from the abandoned truck.

Materials of disaster in the air - see photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The collapse of the Parafest festival tents caused massive destruction.
The president of the Joensuu Parafestival, Arto Pippuri, estimates that the festival will be economically accessible, and the event can also be organised next year.
Kalle Salonen, the last performer of the Parafest, performed at the end of Friday afternoon with a torilalava.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances in the premises of the city theatre from 1 p.m.
The Art Center in Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 13 to 15.
The program is organized in a planned manner.
The outflow occurs in a cloudy cloud when rainwater and its weight initiate a decreasing airflow.
Changes in the form of water in the flood cloud bind the heat, and thus the dropping air cools and its speed towards the ground accelerates.
According to the Meteorological Institute, several collisions occur in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict the trajectory of the outflows.
The outflow hit the backyard of the art museum in Joensuu, the venue of Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents collapsed, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people injured themselves slightly.
Among them was one child who was transported slightly injured to follow-up treatment.
Air Pollution Aging Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners aging faster than usual.
The reason for the aging of the skin is air pollution.
According to the British study, the Evening Standard.
The British skincare company Caci analyzed London’s air with the smallest particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retirees in London is two and a half years older than that of a rural comrade.
Small particles aging the skin are very fine dust pollution, which originates from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which according to the Evening Standard, nearly 9,500 Londoners die each year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outermost layer of the skin.
The Cac study found that premature aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk on their work trips in the vicinity of crowded streets.
Londoners can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with different masks, but for a more practical solution, regular cleansing of the skin is recommended.
Tractor brakes cheated - a man standing in front of him
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went to visit in front of it, the tractor's brakes cheated and the tractor turned on the man.

Josban, Kataja and River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all Saliband World Championships since 2003.
Now Tampere is already in its sixth race, only 2013 was a better one for Canada in North American exports.
I was working at the Market and playing with the Sicilian women when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Saliband national team.
I was interested, and here we are, Jumppane, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City, Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen joined the University of Joensuu to study computer processing.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no such thing as a SM-level game like Salibandy.
Sahl was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoj ice hockey in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played with the University in the 1991–92 Saliband SM series, the next three passes took place in Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM series peaked in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM series through 10, a total of 169 matches 51<0x2B>34<0x3D>85.
The last SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Vääänen were named to the national team

The main coach of the Salibandyma team is Petri Kettunen, who is from the Continental region.
Beach volleyball player Essi Hasu circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold missing from prize box
Essi Hasu is quitting as a beach volleyball player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish beach volleyball championships will be held at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
Over the course of three days, the medals will be played in both adult and young series.
In cooperation with the Kouvola Volleyball Players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, the six best pairs of each series are eligible for the SM final tournament.
The local colour of the tournament is represented by the NMKY raised by Essi Hasu, who has been part of the Finnish beach volley for many years.
Currently in Helsinki, Hasu is eagerly awaiting games in front of a well-known audience.
Hopefully as many as possible will be able to watch this weekend.
I'm sure it's going to be a great stadium for the football stadium.
I have not played in adult series very often in Kouvola, so it is great to play in the finals at home corners, Hasu feels.
The village of Kouvola ignited Hasu’s passion for sport and gave good wishes for a great hobby.
There are a lot of memories of childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of 9 in the NMKY E-girls in Elimäen.
The main thing in mind is too big game shirts, knee pads on the cheeks, as well as amazing ass shouts and choreographies after a point, Hasu recalls.
In a small village, a sports group was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team’s spirit created an environment where it was fun to play.
All the families were strongly involved in the operation - the teammate's father trained us and our mother was the chairman for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volleyball was already a natural variety choice against the indoor volleyball.
Swimming pool has been played by Bibi since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also attended the Junior SM Tour competitions myself, considering that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkis in the SM Finals over the weekend.
After Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahden, the goal of the doubles that were penalized for the second time in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM gold is still missing from the prize box, Hasu throws value.
A weekend in Kouvola may be the last for Hasulle in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civil work are expected.
Yes, the international career is over after the Tournament.
Otherwise, the bodyguards are placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon Koli boldly went on to become an agricultural entrepreneur
As an entrepreneur, agriculture means risk gains, sweat and strength.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Koli started working as a continuation of their home state just two years ago, together with his little brother Valtteri Kol.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers with their own experience.
Starting up as a rural entrepreneur meant borrowing and enlargement of the estate so that bread could come into the hands of agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a kid.
I’ve always wanted to be on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I’ve put everything into the game.
If something starts, then I think it should be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a yard, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
However, I myself joined the project with great courage and I have been fully involved in it, says Salomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be fine.
The goal of Salomon Kol, a carpenter growing company, is to invest in an even larger hub.
The work has yielded results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten young food producers of the Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
He will be able to vote on the magazine’s website until August 21.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest number of years (after June 2012) and the first number above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
The average annual inflation, measured by the cost of living indices, was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015-July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014-July 2015).
The cost of living index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 has been -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, prices for the following consumer goods increased: foodstuffs and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as last month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is criticized as Asian cartoonist
Snapchat says the anime has served as a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to edit reality and identity in ways of playing that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character that would suit Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
The lenses are simple, facial twisting tools that produce more than 30 million enhanced selfies per day.
All the mistakes quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticized for the claim that the app advertises a blackface mask or favors bleaching skin color as a beauty item.
So when Snapchat advertised this week for some users a lens that gave them twisted eyes, twisted teeth and pulled pussies, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - a "yellowface" or yellowface.
And they were wondering if these repeated controversies could be a sign of the company’s larger problem of diversity.
News and misgivings spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it had discontinued the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was intended to honor animated characters, not caricatures from Asians.
But for racist observers, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others strongly denied anime comparisons.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely shared, said in her email that the lens was “at least offensive and uncomfortable.”
He added that "it is difficult to argue against a comparison with the most vicious Asian cartoon and filter effects."
It shows that the filter is not only yellowish, but yellowish, exported to extreme disadvantage.
Snapchat is not the only company that goes beyond these cultural merits.
American culture seems to be caught up in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge, racially more diverse audience of young people can mean that they’re even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an insulting image of the user, “it’s much harder for these guys to be unnoticed than before.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and in a telephone interview, he said he believed that race-related disputes reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat’s payroll practices.
Zhu criticized the company mainly for white men and decided to write with the hashtag <0x23>DeleteSnapchat (<0x23>RemoveSnapchat)
"Either they don't have a diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, which is why they are able to make such decisions," said Zhu, a Chinese-American, "or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they're not in positions where they felt they were safe or able to stand up."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the races of its staff, but according to the representative, the company hired a recruiter some time ago to focus on underrepresented populations and push forward internal integration efforts.
On his part, Zhu said he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding, "I think they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not ok."
Congressional Panel Says Military Officers Falsified ISIS Intelligence
In a report published on Thursday, a congressional panel said the U.S. military headquarters had prepared intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against ISIS than what the events on the ground justify.
The inter-annual report of the Republican Chairman of the Defence Forces Committee of the House of Representatives, the Intelligence Committee and the Sub-Committee on Defence Funds found "wide-spread dissatisfaction" among the headquarters's intelligence analysts, who said that the Isis fisherman's
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is a branch of the Armed Forces War zone in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The outputs of the inquiry approved by senior Centcom executives typically gave a more positive picture of the U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than the facts on the ground justified,"they were regularly more positive for the inquiry of the leaflets than for the inquiry.
"Centcom's events are unacceptable - our fighters in the war suffer when poor analysis is presented to high-ranking decision makers," said Ken Calvert, a California Republican.
Centcom’s management failures reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the underlying problems in the descriptions and analysis of the headquarters of the United States’ attempts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that the high-ranking administrations of the Obama administration have ordered reports to be inch-shared, it depicts analysts feeling as if the Centcom leaders had put pressure on them to portray the Islamic State, the Islamic State, in an attack on ISIS.
“Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters’ press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves,” the report said.
The Centcom government, for example, has publicly stated that a major attack to recapture Mosul could begin even as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in possession of ISIS.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," said Mike Pompeo, a representative of the People's Republican Party.
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, the top intelligence leaders of the U.S. military headquarters manipulated the headquarters’ intelligence output to minimize ISIS threats in Iraq.
The Republicans created the working group after hearing that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, follows more extensive results while the investigation is underway.
The Defence Ministry's Chief Inspector has launched an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom's request for information.
Democratic members of the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with the conclusions of some of the Republican working groups.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a futile isolated process for ISIS and Iraqi security forces' intelligence assessments," Adam B. Schiff, the committee's chief Democrat, said in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the publication of survey findings", misinformed analysts, and did not "allow enough room for differing perspectives".
Schiff and Democrats said they did not find any evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom analysts to reconcile their findings with "predetermined or political narrative".
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday on the preliminary results of a congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that a Pentagon Superintendent has launched an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon representative, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congress report as long as the Superintendent's investigation is underway.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a sound dialogue on these essential national security issues."
The investigation has other consequences than the question of whether U.S.-led bombings in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defence authorities now claim).
Last year’s accusations questioned how much President Obama can trust the headquarters to deliver honest estimates of war operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other areas of crisis.
Criticism of the Islamic State’s inquiry reflects more than a decade of backwards disputing when Centcom’s inquiry analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that despite the many analysts’ objections in 2003, President George W. Bush’s administration supported the inquiry.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against Islamic State intelligence.
According to the authorities last year, the Hooker group concluded that despite the contrary public statements, the free attacks against Islamic State-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell their land.
The Times reported in September that, however, this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators viewed his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. wins for fourth consecutive time in women's hockey by holding a preliminary round with Britain
The day after she had made three goals in Japan's 6-1 win, Katie Bam made the first two goals in the U.S. women's national hockey team in India's 3-0 win.
Five goals in two games sound like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he was not sure if he had done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps a record of his paintings."
But this is what he knows: the Americans are in a 4-0 situation in the Olympic tournament and they are sharing their group’s first place with Britain, which was still unbeaten after Japan’s 2-0 win on Thursday.
The United States and the United States will face in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have survived the quarter-finals, and this game decides who will be the first and who will be the second in their team of six.
The first place is to avoid a strong Dutchman, the leader of the second group, slightly longer at the start of the quarterfinals.
No matter how the game ends on Saturday, the Americans have aroused great success here, four years after they left for the last 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in the Pennsylvania Blue Bell and took over the hockey field for the first time at the age of 3 (his parents were playing in Drexel), joining the national team at the age of 16, making him the youngest player of all time.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because he did not join his finals.
In 2012, nothing went wrong with him and his teammates.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
“Culture change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
We didn’t have the same job in London as we do now.
We've done a full reversal.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half of the season with a swing near the painting.
India had come to the game with no wins in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation in the 1-0 draws until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball for a long time to the left of the field, then circled in the middle and raced the ball to lead the Americans to the 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added a fourth in the last half.
This zero game was the first U.S. goalkeeper in the tournament for Jackie Briggs, who had left one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the game on Saturday.
Trampoline Peace in the Middle of the Olympics
Wherever you are, whatever the time, the Olympics are on.
Rio de Janeiro’s events seem continuous and unavoidable with a message of fierce competition and effort.
It’s like the Olympic turn itself would be a igniting message box that’s being transmitted from a sniper to a swimmer and a gymnast to a triathlon.
It’s impossible to turn on TV, read newspapers, or listen to a friend’s conversation in a coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the hatred between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the Olympic first-time and future heartbreaker who has learned to smile, could well be one of the familiar names presented at the best viewing time and supported by sponsorship agreements and good-looking tv ads - if he was a swimmer, an inspiring or an intellectual.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest in California, competes for the Olympic ball in a trampoline.
The Olympics do not illuminate all species equally.
Farther from the center, partially in the shadow, are the species that are not generally accepted: air ballooning, ballooning, ballooning, taekwondo.
We always have breasts, so long live it.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special preferences, I would like to pay attention to the charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic type since 2000, when it made its first appearance at the Sydney Olympics, its presence has been so limited over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic type at all.
This can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to race in the genre, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete has not progressed to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually distribute men's, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie McLenna will defend their London gold medals.
However, the trampoline is associated with a certain charm of a subcontractor, in part because in the uncivilized ear it sounds better suited to a clown school than to the Olympics.
Here, I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just a fan of inability to fly.
The species has opportunities for excitement, as can be seen from the color of the infinite pumps of cartoons, but it also has the excitement of exercise and swimming jump, the two species that in principle combine.
The word "trampolín" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means a trampoline.
The championship seekers jumped on a giant trampoline to a height of almost 30 feet, and they had to perform rolling business series (translations, arts and volts) and finally land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries compete, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction for the Olympics is straight forward.
Those who wish for a medal have to go further, faster, up and over - sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They are not only hunting for a painting line or a starter wall, but also, in television newscasts, another border that crosses: a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatic – and it can even get the spectator in tears.
But that’s also the reason why watching the games can be a little boring.
The trampoline offers a relaxing moment.
The trampoline's up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new ascent, seemingly less weighted than an astronaut, goes up, then down, and then effortlessly again up.
Of course, this is not about competition or difficulty, but during the programme there is no fierce rush towards the end, no jumps to the distance, only a dreamy, melting interruption of time and gravity.
It is as close to the Zen state as it can be to the Olympics.
The women’s races and then the finals will take place on Friday afternoon, starting at 13:00 (ET), the men’s races will also come on Saturday at 13:00.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon software from 2:00 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic rush, they offer a quiet, enchanting moment, which is unlikely to be noticed in general chaos.
And if awareness is achieved only by offering men’s athletes to watch and play (as U.S. men’s men suggested a while ago according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his exciting new fan.
"The Generation Shows Its Mind" in Ethiopia, a Long-Term Ally of the United States
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable states, a strong Western ally, whose economy is growing rapidly.
However, in recent months, anti-government protests have cured the country as they spread to more and more areas.
Alone last week, thousands of people stranded in the streets demanding a thorough political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was ruthless.
Eyewitnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Extinct videos recorded in protests, believed to be at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year, show how the security authorities beat young people with their hammers while being forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Court of Human Rights is now demanding a thorough investigation.
“Keeping this country together has always been difficult, and in the future it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, project manager for the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is Africa’s second most populous country after Nigeria, and the West appreciates its stability.
The US military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist attacks in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much help from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved tremendously, and the capital city of Addis Ababa is even a new train of business travelers.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model for democracy, human rights organizations have been constantly talking about government oppression, the opposition has been limited, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed, or driven to a distant desert.
But this may be changing.
“If you oppress people and they have no choice but to show their mind, it will happen,” said Seyoum Teshome, a professor at the University of Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth reflects his mind.
One generation shows his mind.
The complaints are diverse and cover everything from the ruling coalition to the disciplinary results.
After the much-criticised elections last year, the ruling party of its allies has been given the last seat of the opposition, and now it holds all the seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are increasing, and the battle that took place along this tense and controversial border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated over the past few years, may try to exploit and rearm.
Numerous factors explain why after years of dying under the surface, the broken feelings are now exploding.
The first one seems to be seemingly safer: smartphones.
It was only in the last few years that a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones have expanded and Internet service has improved.
Even though the government would shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during protests, many people can still communicate through the location-hidden network media servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, Ethiopia’s two largest ethnic groups, the Oromos and the Amharas, are better suited to each other.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas, who came from mainly Ethiopian Christian highlands, succeeded in politics and in business, taking advantage of the highlands, many of which are Muslims and who live in the suburbs.
But this is changing, too.
"We are on our way to organising under a single rainstorm," said Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest protests have been in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many amhars and swarms think that the unjust rule of Ethiopia belongs to the tiger people, which covers about six per cent of the population and controls the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical nero, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to detect early signs of dissatisfaction and use secret envoys to harm opponents.
"The current administration has no such foundation," said conflict analyst Abdi.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was taken to fill Meles' boots as relatively unknown.
Unlike Meles, who was from the northern tiger region of Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the tiger-controlled security services do not trust him.
Many fear that this can lead to an increase in blood clotting.
For the first time, Ethiopia was in power in 2005, when thousands showed their mind about the elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have been humiliated and then robbed by the government.
During the follow-up, many protesters died, albeit less than in the past months, and that period of restlessness passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new business journey, and for the significant progress made in the fight against poverty.
But clearly, this has not stopped the country’s internal contempt for the Ethiopian government.
And now it's starting to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the city of Amhara in Gondar attacked tiger-owned enterprises, and anti-tigre anger is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western Allies in a nutshell.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for flights to neighboring Somalia, although it said it had closed this base some time ago.
While the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want their allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This," said Abdi, "is a real balance."
Donald Trump Describes Obama-Based ISIS Claim as “Sarcastic”
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress his latest campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he said this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The study raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who were faced with defending him during the stormy period, in a difficult position where they had to explain remarks that he did not necessarily mean.
After a tip at a campaign summit on Wednesday, Trump asserted the same thing more and more enthusiastically in interviews on Thursday, in which he said his intention was indeed to say that the president and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in an early Friday morning tweet, Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The publication was a complete translation from the previous day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was really serious about the charge.
When Conservative radio broadcaster Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump create his remarks by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took this into his hearings.
The latest criticism sparks a situation in which Trump has sought to re-focus his campaign amid the results of the survey.
Trump and Clinton were fighting over the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump attempted to return to the subject.
Running back to Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense in the past.
Late in July, after he faced widespread criticism apparently suggesting that the Russians should hack into Clinton’s emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, “I am indeed sarcastic.”
The approach will allow Trump to go beyond the boundaries of political speech and then return if necessary.
"I think it's a model where she tests certain messages that are important to her fans. She looks at how they work and then 'clarifies' in a direction or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the two candidates.
But I also think that he is polite about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be filtered through a number of different lenses.
Instead of alleviating his speeches for a large voting audience, Trump has been more clumsy in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll published on Friday showed that Trump is significantly behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for the provocative things he says, he often accuses critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
Faced with an ever-increasing review over the last few months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have forced his loyal allies into an unpleasant position where they have to publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks are.
New York's former mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, saw a lot of trouble defending the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe that what he says is true, political comments," Giuliani said, when asked about the authenticity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton have founded the Islamic State.
That’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that’s why it happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq.
Most of the mainstream Republicans are trying to claim that the Obama administration, where Clinton worked as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to worsen because it failed to effectively address the situation in the Middle East.
Before the meetings in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack news media that rubbing his every word and are biased against him.
He mocked “bad, pitiful” television experts who were trying to make it clear to him by saying “They won’t succeed!”
Some Democrats mocked Trump’s apology as a new evidence that he was inappropriate as president.
Previously Closed Cafe Returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a modest, cash-friendly place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, Bedford Avenue street was too expensive for it.
The company that replaced Verbi in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cup-shaped soaps.
The locals depressed it as the last loss in a restructuring middle-class city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is upset and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it is also a reinvention.
The revived Verb opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and can be paid with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there is the same unmistakable atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verbi is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe, who owns and manages the new venue.
He started at Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When the client offered to fund him in a new location, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, had a lot of things going on.
Verb used the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
He brought in new ingredients.
In the dining room there are peconi egg yolks, and the coatings offer, for example, capricci and roasted onions.
There's brown rice in the bars.
The café no longer serves beer, but fresh juices are made there.
For nine months, Rodriguez says he has noticed a steady stream of old carrier customers.
“Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers as well,” he said.
On one last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he walked to the cafe.
He says when Verb closed, he quit drinking coffee for a moment.
“I understood that I enjoyed Verb’s coffee and culture,” he said.
Now he has returned to a couple of coffees, although on that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his usual ice-cream, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verby faithfully since 2003.
He went there before work and always made the same order.
"Every day at fifteen more than seventeen, regularly like a clock, I went in and they were making spices with my bagel," he said.
Photograph. Rodriguez said that he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes because of the variation, he places a spicy bagel with pecon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't want to go to the soap shop that took over the old spaces.
In fact, the owners of Soap Chere offered to make Verbille special soap, which would be used as an ingredient in the coffee refrigerated coffee.
"I think we can still stick to the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish settlers of Greenpoint have also accepted coffee.
One of these new customers turned the food into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he plans to put it on display soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juicer wants to pull and sell chilled coffee.
It is possible that the cafe will be expanded to the adjacent building.
It is enough for many customers to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a client and said it was uncomfortable when the place was closed.
When the new venue was opened, Whitt said that he felt like he had come home walking in and ordering coffee.
“I needed to smell it,” he said.
A Square Meal: the season's disinfecting food
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office room.
President Roosevelt liked refined Fifth Avenue dishes, such as chicken pastry, and Maryland's favorite tortoise dishes.
On that day, his diet was more modest: filled eggs in a tomato bowl, a potato portion and a dessert of ice cream.
“It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffer,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
The couple in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe’s latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about the life of the Lower East Side food stall in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, released by Harper on Tuesday, is the story of American food during the great breeding season of the 1930s.
Showing some kind of culinary solidarity, they meet a journalist at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, unrefined lunch bar in the Flatiron area that has been in operation since the 1929 stock exchange collapse.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered fresh cheese-olive flour, and Coe, 57, took the dose with turkey, potato sauce and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meat-scratch, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating the lamb season.
"The wreaths were very popular," Ziegelman said.
It was peanut butter, liver butter, pumpkin butter.
They were made from a manufacturing ingredient and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual manufacturing product.
Imagine your cancer with so many peanuts that they would make up your dinner.
Coe's annoyed.
"It must have felt in the stomach from the lead weight," he said.
In the years before the slaughter on American tables, especially in the countryside, it was like eating-in-a-many-like-parts-in-the-shoulder table.
Women’s groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh peanuts were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War, and A Square Meal chronicled the ways in which the nation survived the sudden disappearance of the land of abundance.
"At that time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was a new, affordable diet: Mystery dishes, such as scarves and boxes, became the main dishes, and the box was a "magnificent way to use food sources," Ziegelman said, as cooks were able to hide the less attractive subsets of the creamy ingredients.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
The meat, which had been at the center of American dishes for years, became a cost-effectively dosed luxury product.
Special ingredients were tried when the calorie and nutrient content were more important than the taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
In the study, Ziegelman also prepared an age-old dish for a book containing recipes, in which the roasted onions were filled with peanuts.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman said: "It was unreal."
Peanut butter is not suitable for roasted onions.
This was typical for many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Office from 1923 to 1943, guided the country’s food practices more than ever before or after.
Publishers' recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines encouraged women to start being "budgetary" and respond to the challenge of converting spicy spaghetti and carrot-like flavored flavors into doses.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic tastings.
Particularly tasty are reports of the government's reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover let me eat your cake attitude.
At the same time, while publicly praising his childhood for simple, ioval peasant food, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire who had become him.
"He liked continental food, like fish with a doughnut," Coe said.
She ate almost a gold dish in the dining room, covered with smoke.
He was a great outsider of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housewife who was not interested in taste, the White House became a place that "provided not only Washington's oldest, but also the worst-prepared food."
Many of the Lamanite food routes were abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
The legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they got a better understanding of Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, for example, how she was unable to throw food away.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick."
There was a gunshot accident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had made at home: the ice cream dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called frosting foam," Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes a prominent name.
There was no cream foam in the dessert, only cream, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
They all unwillingly dipped their spoons into a scissor, brown lyser.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe felt it over and over again.
Sounding like a positive budgetary, he told his wife: "A little mocked German nuts could help."
Gilead to be reimbursed for legal fees in hepatitis C patent battle against Merck
The U.S. Married Judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the attorney’s fees incurred by it in the disputed drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc. for hepatitis C.
In June, Gilead was released from <0x24>200 million payments after they violated Merck's two patents related to Gilead's success drugs for Sovald and Harvoni. This release followed when a U.S. judge found Merck's abuses, which included a misdemeanor and a false oath.
In a ruling on Thursday, U.S. fiancé judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to be exempted from the compensation it received in its opposition to the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines, which can significantly cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other for ownership of the active substance in Gilead’s medicines, sofosbuvir.
U.S.-backed forces say they have completely conquered ISIS-controlled Manbij
U.S.-backed forces have completely conquered the northern Turkish border town of Manbij after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now exploring the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left.
The forces had released more than 2,000 civilian anti-government militants who were detained by the militants, from the Sharfan Darwish SDF Allied Army, Manbij's Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to explore it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons paid <0x24>10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2% of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, which showed that the income of the Democratic presidential candidate and her spouse in that year was <0x24>10.75 million, and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated <0x24>1 million to charities, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly <0x24>5.3 million in speeches, and the former foreign minister announced that he had received <0x24>3 million from editor-in-chief Simon & Schuster in his career.
Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine, from Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton, issued a 10-year tax return.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are setting the stage for economic transparency," Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and cancels his previous promises to release his tax returns.
The U.S. presidential candidates will publish their tax returns, even if the law does not oblige them to do so.
New York businessman Trump's lawyers have appealed to the tax authorities for a reason to refuse to publish tax returns.
"It's your turn," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter, posting a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump’s special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits are ready.
Trump’s critics, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues in 2012, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business, and many other examples.
Clinton has caught up with the problem in an online video on Friday that featured prominent Republicans urging Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done in the last few decades: publishing his tax returns,” he told the public.
Politico has reported that Trump has not paid any or very little tax in the two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times lending business columnists on Friday to a number of tax lawyers and accountants who said the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax burden has become a problem in the presidential election.
Clinton has backed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that those earning more than <0x24>1 million a year would pay at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At the Clinton meeting in Nebraska’s Omaha last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also has an ongoing tax audit, and that Trump is “not afraid” of the tax collector’s office, but of voters.
The Clinton campaign has issued tax returns since 2007.
Today, the real tax rate of the Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, was about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5 percent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax return showed that only <0x24>100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was an inexpensive index-bound investment fund, and Clinton announced <0x24>109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and radish condoms enhance Tanzania’s elephant protection
Conservatives in Tanzania use an unusual means to prevent elephants from wandering into human habitats - they throw away animals with condoms filled with chili powder.
The tool has proven to be effective, and the idea has been invented several years ago by the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the American Nature Conservancy, has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of North Tanzania to use non-violent forests in four steps that will allow them to take advantage.
In the past, many people used sticks to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we have developed...tools, we have seen a change in attitude in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of the game without harming them," Honeyguy CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include showing an intrusive elephant on the headlight and ringing a torch.
If it does not stop the animal, the so-called "chili cloud" is discarded.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and soil, as well as sparkling, after which the condom is twisted so that only the ignition thread is visible.
When the condom is ignited, it explodes and sprays chili powder into the air.
One scent is usually enough to send the elephant in the other direction.
The last way is the trigger that fires a Roman candle into the air, which produces a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticises Berlin hotel that deleted Israel's code at the request of Arabs
A French Jewish filmmaker has revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's code, according to the employee, due to the "demands" of Arab customers.
The Holocaust documentary film Shoah made Claude Lanzmann disillusioned by writing an open letter to the Berlin hotel Kempinski Bristol in a German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find a hotel in Israel from a list of countries in the area.
However, the country is not mentioned among those countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How can it be possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel was removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
In search of explanation, the filmmaker took the matter to the reception at the hotel.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer received from him was "scarred of him."
The hotel receptionist said it was a "considered decision by the Kempinski hotel management."
The reason behind the decision caused even more bullying in the filmmaker.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding the removal of Israel’s code,” Lanzmann said.
Israeli Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great injustice", according to the Zuddeutsche Zeitung.
“We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
It is already a big mistake in itself.
But even more embarrassing is the fact that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident caused quite a response online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski hotel simply "abandoned" the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Shut up," said another publication, noting that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all the charges and called the incident "inaccuracy" and "sorry" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
“This order to not include Israel in the list of emergency votes has never been made,” Kempinski’s spokesman said in a statement to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the code has now been added.
Police have used tear gas and rubber scrap against Brazilian students who are suspected to be
On Thursday, students met with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo as students gathered to show their willingness to oppose reforms of the government’s public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bands against the protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement officers tried to dismantle the student group, which led to the police using rubber loans and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration to express their horrific plans.
Sao Paulo governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin proposed that fewer than 100 public schools would be closed and 300,000 students would be re-invested to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest protest came just days after the protesters marched as a group to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was detained by the Senate, as he voted for his office.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly grows by 71%
After the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan said.
After the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in the country's transactions, the ambassador said.
Russian companies will continue to link existing companies to Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
“Of course, one of the main objectives of Iran’s bilateral cooperation is to expand trade,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015, totalling <0x24>856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent, totaling <0x24>697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to <0x24>158 million.
“The growth of trade was achieved with the delivery of machines, vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects this year a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Delegation in Iran granted about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was also the first time among the 20 countries with the highest number of tourists in Russia.
“It seems safe to say that last year’s record number of Iranian Muslims in Russia will break,” he said.
At the same time, very few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in good condition," he said.
Scottish Callum Skinner crashes into British cycling gold at Napate
Scotland's Callum Skinner competed in the men's team print at Rio's cycling stadium last night, when the UK team's three defended their championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role where his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy recovered, the legend was very proud of his youth when he beat New Zealand's favourite for the win.
Britain won a shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after modestly being placed sixth in the March race at the World Championships in London, though Hoy has since finished his race.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Special Envoy Jamie Staffin.
This was achieved just in time when Hindes appeared.
Today's cessation also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was a man whom the British coaches held against the Scottish potential, which is now realized.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the championship with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner made an Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first lap.
And the British trio won the double gold battle.
Hindes was just behind after his own round, but Kenny pushed the team to lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, and it included Hindes driving in a larger gear to slow and allow Kenny and Skinner in particular to stick to the pace.
Hoy followed up with his position as a BBC expert, attracting the attention of Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they entered the awards ceremony.
23-year-old Glasgowlan Skinner said, "Comparison is deceptive."
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
We finished the Olympics and won the World Champions.
It was unbelievable at one time.
There can be no better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments, and the British competitors have not complained.
This time, there was no similar problem with the overwhelming win.
Hindes said, "It felt like I was in London when there were so many UK flags on the track."
As a team, we found a connection over the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply wonderful.
One event, one gold medal for the nation, won seven out of ten cycling races in Beijing and London.
If this reflects the developments of the last five months, we are waiting for the successful five days at the cycling stadium.
On the basis of the dedication shown by Kenny, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy’s brilliance, winning three Olympic gold medals in one of the Olympic Games.
It would mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (that is apparently a holy day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister), would have a total number of medals to rise to six ho silvers and yer gold.
It would be the same as Hoyla.
Kenny is competing in the next sprint, which starts today and lasts for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I just enjoyed this one now.
Team competition is always the best.
It will be won with friends.
“Winning alone is, frankly, lonely.”
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the knight's value."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest four-person, four-kilometre team races in time.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The gold-winning world record in London in 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the focus of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the deadlines, when officials invited him to a length measurement.
In a similar women’s race, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavien advanced in the world record time at 4:13:260.
The UK team has learned to trust that its great cycling team will take over the middle of the Olympics and achieve a whole set of medals.
When presented in Beijing and London with a truly exceptional and complete control, expectations have been reduced before the Rio competitions.
There has been a drama, the least of which has been the difference between technical director Shane Sutton in April due to sexism and temptation as well as the end of the race by great figures such as Hoyn and Victoria Pendleton.
Based on the first-night competitions at the cycling stadium, however, it seems that Britain’s now legendary reputation could once again take its place at the perfect moment.
The future of Portland’s meltdown is questionable due to cut-off of the electricity pact
The future of Portland’s Victoria aluminum melting, as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs, is uncertain when a power company distributing electricity to the plant reveals that one of the plant’s owners is concluding a distribution agreement, so a cut in all distribution agreements is expected.
The measure follows the decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian administration that the aid required for the operation of the plant will not be continued.
The aid for a period of 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk at the Alcoan Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition, the snowball effect may be possible, as the melting uses about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's meltdown, which led to the closure of the English power plant last year.
The Alcoan Portland meltdown loses money and is under lockdown.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the factory, which began as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the price of the factory production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminum melting plant in Latrobe Valley from Loy Yang An, said it is also awaiting three other owners to conclude their contract.
Most of the factory is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
“AGL is waiting for the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the physical electricity demand for the melt will continue,” he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called "protection agreements", which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a termination period of 12 months, so they actually expire in 2017.
“That’s why AGL expects contracts to produce results in the 2017 financial year,” the electricity company said.
All possible impacts on AGL’s earnings from 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong prospects for the futures market for electricity wholesale prices.
AGL said it had already "anticipated the termination" of the contracts by <0x24>187 million in its accounting.
Alcoa said the decision to terminate contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ... ability to keep the melting in operation or to secure the melting power supply.”
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the deal was due to enter into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the deal.
Analysts have been alerted to both the Portland meltdown in Victoria and the potential closure of the Tomagon plant near Newcastle as the industry’s economic situation is poor.
Earlier this week, AGL CEO Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts per year.
"If both factories leave the market, this is a significant reduction in the demand for the [electric] market.
For us as an electrician, this would not be a good thing,” he said.
Kendall, not just a Kardashian reality TV star, is in September’s Vogue case
Kendall Jenner, 20, the fourth daughter of model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner Clan, is in the September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador and has been a model at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
“Looking at this blanket in a room full of loved ones made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The poster edition was followed by an odd (or perhaps just Kardashian-style fit?), scripted reality video with the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (except for Rob and Caitlyn's problem cases, and included with all of our favorite amusement kits.
It's almost every children's TV show's "birthday" cliche drawing (Seacrest says the words "you probably thought we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning-drawn puppy), but Kriss had to get his other girls somehow to benefit from this pub.
This is because we have certainly moved to a new Kardashian era with the Vogue site in September.
Kendall's granddaughter Kim may have filed Vogue's lawsuit at first (he shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is entirely in its own category.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling edition of the year.
Its thickness resembles more of a coffee table than a fashion sheet, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion found that 615 of last year’s 832-page lessons had advertising content).
The disclosure of its cover star is so eagerly awaited that over the last two years the images of the newspaper have leaked before the official publication.
Previous women in the suit include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "publics who act as models" than "models who are celebrities".
Oscar-winning and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was wearing in 2013, a year after Lady Gagan's honor.
But if it happens that Jenner, whom the magazine describes as a "success model" of his generation, would first hit the mentioned category, he's pretty good with it.
These celebrities are not the relatives or reality stars of famous people or today’s youth who are able to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all this).
They are justifiably talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
Last year, Beyoncé has been one of the strongest years of her career with Lemonade’s release.
Of course, not everyone is interested in Jenner’s success.
With his true-tv history, Jenner’s role in the fashion world will always be the backbone.
In June, Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid as "the motherfucker of this moment".
This feeling resurfaced with Jenner’s Vogue cover.
But in dissatisfaction, rotation is inappropriate.
Kendall Jenner is Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
She's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you the Lauder's makeup.
He and all his sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own, paywall guarantees in their apps available.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she took to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and this kid, she's a real TV star.
Community legal centres displace 160 000 people every year
Every year, more than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people are displaced from the Community legal centres as the sector prepares for the effects of additional financial cuts on its already existing activities at its borders.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance to fight unfair marriages and the like - are already turned away from their search for free bribes and foreplay.
The legal services already extended to the Community borders are being prepared for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, Head of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres report, thousands of people are being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not revoked, the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, which means that every year thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need," he said.
People who start violent relationships with unmanageable and disastrous debts, families in residence, dishonest workers - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they don't get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable residents of Queensland will be forced to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately cancel these cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government made a commitment to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community legal centres and their customer communities, and the Government of Palaszczuk must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s campaign was challenged after an employee was allegedly threatened with a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was challenged to justice for allegedly not doing anything after they were told that the campaign’s head of operations in North Carolina threatened a gunman in February while driving a Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed by former state campaign software trainer Vincent Bordin in a state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be treated internally before realizing that "it shouldn't happen".
Chief Earl Phillip “drawn out the gun, put his right thumb on the forearm and pushed the pipe against Vincent’s knee,” Bordini said in the complaint.
After appealing to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had a similar experience with Phillip, the complaint said.
"There is no need to fire weapons to cause damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate provoked anger when he told the public in North Carolina that "the second addition people" - which usually refers to gun owners and gunmen - could take action if his opponents and his competitor C. Hiller's
Trump’s campaign said the media had taken his word out of context and that he was not in favour of violence.
The Border Challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance, and Phillip for violence, abuse, and discouragement.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the request for comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
His call request to his consulting firm for the Innovative Consulting Service was not answered immediately.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s campaign has been controversial.

Britain needs to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and prosperity all over the country, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was Heathrow's great enthusiasm, just as it was the enthusiasm for the 2012 London Games, when we worked so hard to make sure that all our people and our region benefited from the competition.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Only local communities will be able to create 10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs, and youth unemployment around the airport will be eliminated.
Like before the 2012 London Games, some come to think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready to compete and that we would be ashamed in front of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked to him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The enlargement will create up to 180,000 new jobs and <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented an infrastructure investment programme of 11 billion pounds in time and budget to stay: from the T5, voted the world’s best airport terminal for five consecutive years, to the T2, built between the two fastest airports in the world.
The team is now ready to implement a third track, supported by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private money.
The 2012 Olympics in London were a great success for the UK, and I am convinced that Heathrow’s expansion is also the case.
It is time to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade, and create a legacy of skills and employment on which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook to block ads in cat and mouse games
For companies that receive money from online advertising, companies to bypass the ad-blocking program are "in and mouse games," one of the companies that make such a program said.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its computer-accessible pages, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users can update the program’s filters to block ads again on the social network site.
On Tuesday, Facebook said its website code would be exchanged around ads to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says that it has circumvented the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "a far-reaching fight between the open-source ad-blocking community and its rosters has been underway since ad-blocking was invented", and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how much sadness the ad blockers have become to the industry.
Around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, according to last year’s Pagefair and Adobe survey, which is almost four times the number of people using these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook ads.
The company, however, is behind the blockers of ads on the computer, as mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook’s mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer ads are still bringing enough revenue to make Facebook consider it worth investing in such an activity.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its “ad preference” tool to give people more power on how ads are targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrying because they would also block part of the site’s non-advertising content.
“This isn’t a good experience for people, and we’re planning to tackle the problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building Ad Preference-like tools that give people control.
Woman on Swiss highway apparently left behind by car due to suicide
The victim slept on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for eyewitnesses after the woman stayed on the highway under several vehicles on Thursday in the early hours of the case, which was apparently suicide.
The incident took place on A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman committed a "desperate act" and sat down in the dark lying down on a road where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by a number of vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been interviewed, but not all have yet been identified, police said, calling on them and all eyewitnesses who witnessed the incident to register.
The criminal investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
“We’ll see if any of the drivers are charged.
Is it possible to avoid a collision?
It remains to be decided by the prosecutor,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years indicate that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases - both of which included a person walking on a dark highway - it was estimated that drivers could not wait to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, the police were released on charges of negligence after she was found and killed by a man lying on A! road near Paynera one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drunk and fell off the road, the court was told.
The court noted that the policeman, who was responding to an emergency call, drove in a reasoned manner, and that the man’s presence on the road was “totally exceptional and unpredictable,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's case near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's Climate Model: Venus Was Once Inhabited
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was likely once inhabited.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have had heat, anhydrous surface filling and carbon dioxide atmospheric atmospheric at times could have had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus’ slow rotation speed explains its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and it could still have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the formation of the surface of early Venus.
The planet was likely to have drier areas of the Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variation to enable life and protect it from the rapid evaporation of water.
The advantage of early Venus was also a 30% darker sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the sun's sun for almost two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio said in a statement.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick cloud layer that acts as a rain shield protecting the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average temperatures in the climate are actually a few degrees cooler than the current ones on Earth.
The model produced a story about the stages of Venus' development, which is similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was probably once habitable, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water mills burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere was left with its deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of a new Venus climate model in the publication Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy Resigns from Avalanche Coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the actions of Colorado’s Avalanche coach and deputy chief of ice hockey, saying he was the cause of a lack of influence in the team’s decision-making process.
Colorado Deputy Chief Executive Officer/General Joe Sakic confirmed the information and said that the team will immediately begin to search for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have made my duty as Colorado Avalanche's Deputy Director and Chief Coach with enthusiasm, passion and determination," 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
During the summer, I have been thinking for a long time and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and to take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach’s and deputy manager’s views on ice hockey must be fully aligned with those of the organization.
He must also be able to influence the decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are not currently in place.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Royta for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner for the league's best coach in his first Avalanche season in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a win in the middle division, but Minnesota dropped Colorado in the first round of the drop games, and the team has not been able to continue in the last two years.
Avalanche's games in the 2015-16 season ended in 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing the Western Conference Wild Card dropping spot.
Hall of Fame's selected goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups - two at both the Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil strikers continue negotiations and postpone strike
Work struggles between oil workers in the North Sea over wages will be postponed as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
Oil field strikes against Wood Group have been randomly carried out by Royal Dutch Shell-led North Sea drilling boards.
“The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT associations can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process aimed at resolving the current dispute,” the joint statement read.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings starting early next week, so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent labour struggle, which they say is the first in more than 25 years, was an objection to possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group cut North Sea contractors’ commissions by about 9% due to its negative market pressure.
The company’s fee reduction follows a 10% reduction in its contractors in its countries from 2014.
The company said that the additional cuts would provide the company with the necessary mobility space to cope with the market decline.
Shell, in turn, has cut thousands of people off its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as the company reduces its operations as a result of its giant merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with the Allied leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest working problems of a generation in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea is essential to the region's economy.
“We need an economy that works for many, not just a few, both in the North Sea and across the country,” he said in a statement.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than <0x24>1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average for the past five years has been around <0x24>7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiadian constellation
The latest task of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete list of the rotational speeds of the Pleiadian star cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why the star clusters rotate at varying speeds, and how orbital times are associated with planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between the star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Pasadena Center for Infrastructure Processing and Analysis, in a press release.
The Pleiadian constellation is located 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the star clusters were born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They're rolling at their highest level now.
At its peak rotational speed, these adult stars will absorb large amounts of star wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star gets older, its rotational speed starts to slow.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the appearance of identifiable star spots, such as solar spots.
The list of recent stars' rotational speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, with larger ones making pranks slower than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiadians, we see that slow wheels are usually more massive, while the fastest wheels are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiadian constellation is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for evaluating the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian Stars offer an anchor to rotate stars in theoretical models that encompass both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, why, and why stars slow down their rotational speed and so-called hang their ‘dancing shoes’ on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the Pleiadian rotational speeds in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
